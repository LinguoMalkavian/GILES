# GILES
The GILES (General Identifier of Linguistic Expression Similarities ) is an attempt at autimatic character identification in the Buffy corpus 
This is a project for SQUID 2016 (Showcasing Quirky and Unusual Ideas in Development) at the Linguistics Department of the CUNY Graduate
Center.

The purpose of the project is to train several machine learning classifiers using scikit learn with different sets of features and 
observe which features are most informative to distinguish between characters in the tv show Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

The character lines were scrapped from the scripts in buffyworld.com using the buffyscr.py script (requires beautiful soup),
the script can be used to add new characters to the data base.

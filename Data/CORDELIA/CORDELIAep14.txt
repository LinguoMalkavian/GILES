Okay, I'm doing this under protest. It is not fair that they're making participation in the Science Fair mandatory this year. I don't think anyone should have to do anything educational at school if they don't want to.
I want something I can finish in a weekend, okay?
I thought yearbook nerds didn't come out of hibernation till the spring.
Hi. Sorry to interrupt your little undead play group, but I need to ask Willow if she'll help me with my Science Fair project.
I would ask Chris for help, but... (a little emotional) it would bring back too many memories of Daryl.
Of course, I've learned to deal with my pain...
Hello? Can we deal with my pain please?
Eeuw. Why is it that every conversation you people have has the word "corpse" in it?
Darn, I have Cheerleader practice tonight. Boy, I wish I'd known you were gonna be digging up dead people sooner; I would have cancelled.
Guys, if we don't have it down by tomorrow then no one will be led by our cheers. Practice.
Oh, god... oh, god, it's you. Why were you following me?
Buffy? Well, she's -- big shock -- at the graveyard.
Oh, she lied. Isn't she a rascal?
It was horrible. Angel saved me from an arm.
No, I want to go home now. I have to bathe and burn my clothes.
I don't want to go alone. I'm still fragile. (to Angel) Can you take me?
Great! I'll drive.
I'll be right out.
Oh, my god, Buffy...!
I don't know. I was just about to go to the field when Chris came in, and then somebody just jumped me.
Oh, my god! That's the fight song. It's time for the cheerleader pyramid at mid-field. I have to go.
You don't understand, I have to go. I'm the apex.
Please... what's going on... take off the blindfold, I won't scream, I promise...
Please... just take off the blindfold, I promise I won't --
D-Daryl...?
Ready? Ready for what?!
Daryl, please... you don't have to do this.
We can be together anyway. I'll be with you. I promise.
Please...
Buffy! Help me!
Buffy, they're crazy!
Buffy!
No!
Xander, I, uh, just wanted to say thanks for saving my life in there. It was... really brave and heroic and all. And if there's ever anything I can do to repay you...

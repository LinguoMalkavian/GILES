Ha ha ha ha ha.
There’s really no comparison between college men and high school boys – -- I mean look at that.
Not that it’s any of your business, but I happen to be seeing a Delta Zeta Kappa.
Hi Richard. Nice car.
Oh I’d love to –
Her? She’s not my friend.
She’s more like a sister, really. We’re that close.
Come on, Richard and his fraternity brothers want to meet you.
And if there was a God, don’tcha’ think He’d keep it that way?
She’s such a little comedienne!
Did you lose weight? And your hair… (Buffy ignores her) All right, I respect you too much to be dishonest, the hair’s… …well that’s not the point here, is it. The Delta Zetas have to have a certain balance at their party – Richard explained it all to me but I was so busy REALLY LISTENING to him that I didn’t hear much – anyway, the deal is they need you to go. And if you don’t go… …I can’t! I’m talking about Richard Anderson , okay? As in Anderson Farms, Anderson Textiles… … and Anderson Cosmetics! Do you have a hankie?
I’m not going to beg you – please, oh please – you’ll go? Great! We’ll just take my car. Oh Buffy, we’re just like sisters… with really different hair.
This isn’t about fun tonight. It’s about duty: your duty to help me achieve permanent prosperity. Okay, do’s and don’ts. Don’t wear black, silk, chiffon, or spandex – these are my trademarks – don’t do that weird thing to your hair.
Don’t interrupt. Do be interested if someone should speak to you – may or may not happen – do be polite, do laugh at appropriate intervals – ha ha ha ha – and do lie to your mother about where we’re going: it’s a fraternity, there’ll be drinking.
Ahh, are we a little envious? Don’t be, you could join a fraternity of rich, powerful men… in the Bizarro world.
Make-up, make-up… well, just give it your all and keep to the shadows. We are going to have a blast!
Why do they park so darn close to you? (to Buffy) You up for this?
Me too, let’s do it!
You know what’s so cool about college? The diversity. You’ve got rich people and you’ve got… all the other people. Richard!
Thank you.
C’mon Buffy, it’s just a smidge.
The one with the cherry walnut paneling and the two forty-eight inch televisions on satellite feed? No, why don’t you show me?
She’s happiest by herself.
Buffy… where are we?
What’s happening? What did they…?
Why? What are they gonna do?
I want to go home.
Last for what? Who’s first?
Buffy …
Why’d I ever let you talk me into coming here!
What are they, some kind of cult?
You gotta do something.
Offerings… he’s talking about us?
What… what’s down there?
There’s something down there. And they’re gonna throw us down there with it!
No? Well that’s good, that’s…
Feed him. FEED HIM ?!
Hellllppppp !!!
You did it, you saved us.
Thank you, Leslie. Did we forget the extra foam?
Young men. The only way to go.

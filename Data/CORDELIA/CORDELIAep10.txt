Hello... Dufus...? You're blocking my light.
Move on? What a great idea.
Revolve yourselves out of my light.
Hope you studied for the history test.
The one we're having right now in fourth period.
You don't know where the class is, do you?
(not mean, just a fact) Hardly a shocker. You've cut history just about every time we've had it.
It's in here.
Blind luck?
I don't understand... this can't be happening. I was just in the salon.
No! What are you doing?
No... you don't understand... I don't' want to go! I'm not even ON the chess team! I'm sure I'm not...

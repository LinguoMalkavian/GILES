Me in bright spring fashions...
Me at the end-of-school dance...
Definitely my favorite time of year!
... I am, of course, having my dress specially made. Off-the-rack gives me hives.
My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller.
Well, technically, I haven't been elected May Queen yet.
Behold the weirdness.
Wow, I'm not .
Did I ever tell you about when Buffy attacked me ? With a spear when I came out of the ladies' at the Bronze. I still re-live the trauma every time I see a pencil. I can only use felt-tip now...
How about, "color me totally self-involved".
With Shylock it's whine, whine, whine, like the whole world is about him! He acts like it's justice, him getting a pound of Antonio's flesh. It's not justice, it's yicky.
That's such a twinkie defense! Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like the time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike, and it was the most traumatizing even of my life , and she's trying to make it al about her leg! Like my pain meant nothing !...
Ms. Miller?
I wanted to talk to you about my final paper. I'm real unfocused. I have all these points, and I'm pretty sure they all contradict each other.
That's great, thanks.
Remember who to vote for for May Queen. As in, me.
Isn’t this the BOMB? I’m SUCH the campaign strategist.
No, “C” for Wilma. Of course it’s for Cordelia, little brain. This way, people will associate me, Cordelia, with something sweet!
I don’t think I need the loony fringe vote.
I went to the hospital.
The doctor said he’s fine, he’ll be sent home tomorrow. Oh, you should have seen him -- lying there, all black and blue... How’s he going to look in our prom pictures? How will I ever be able to show them to anyone?
You think?
Did you see Mitch? He broke up with Wendy like eight seconds ago and he’s already nosing around.
In the spring, if he makes varsity baseball, maybe I’ll take him on a test-drive...
What do you want?
I just hope somebody can prop him up long enough to take the picture...
Oh, great.
She just fell! We were coming down the stairs and she just fell! All by herself!
God, I am never sitting through one of those alumni lectures again. Two hours of “My Treck Though Nepal”. Hello! There’s nobody caring.
And those slides. “That’s a mountain. Yes, that’s a mountain too. Now let’s look at some mountains.”
Oh! And did you guys check out the extreme toupee? Yeah, that’s realistic. Looked like a cabbage.
Thank you. For making the right choice. For showing how much you all love me!
Being this popular isn’t just my right, it’s my responsibility, and I want you to know I take it seriously...
So come to my coronation tonight at the Bronze, for an evening you’ll never forget!
Ms. Miller, oh-my-god...
Are you okay? What happened?
I knew I’d find you here.
Buffy, I, uh, know we’ve had our difference, you being so weird and all, and hanging out with these, ugh, total losers, and... Well anyway, despite all that, I know you share this feeling we have for each other, deep down...
Somebody’s after me! Someone just tried to kill Ms. Miller! She was helping me with my homework! And Mitch and Harmony...! This is all about me! Me! Me! Me!
I don’t know... because you’re always around when stuff happens, I know you’re strong and you got those weapons... I was kind of hoping you’re in a gang.
Please... I don’t know where else to turn.
Oh, no. I have a life.
I don’t care what it is, just get rid of it!
God, is she wearing Laura Ashley ?
I have no idea at all! I’ve never seen this girl before in my life!
Well, just because the story’s about him doesn’t mean he’s necessarily the hero, right?
Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight.
If I’m not crowned tonight, then... then Marcie’s won! And that’s bad! She’s evil, okay? Way eviler than me.
Buffy’s with me on this.
Great! What?
I need to try on my dress. Am I really bait?
So how much the creepy is that this Marcie’s been at this for months ? Spying on us, learning our most guarded secrets...
And she turned invisible ‘cause she’s so unpopular? Bummer for her.
It’s awful to feel that lonely.
You think I’m never lonely, just ‘cause I’m so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It’s not like any of them really know me. I don’t even know if they really like me half the time. People just want to be in the popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone’s so busy agreeing with me, they don’t hear a word I say.
Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.
If you ever tell anyone I changed in a mop closet...
You were popular? In what alternate universe?
Is that when you became weird and got kicked out?
Buffy? You’re awake?
I can’t move.
I can’t feel my face.
My face! It feels numb. What is she doing?
What does that mean ?
Yeah, what do you want to teach us?
What have you done to my face?
What are you doing?
Please don’t do this...
Noo...
Wait!
Marcie... listen... you think I don’t understand what you’re going through, but I do.
I do... and I could help you. I could. Help you meet people. Everyone could want to know you now... I mean you’re really special.
I do know how you feel, how lonely...
Oh, God, get me out of here...
Can I get untied now?
Hi. Look, I didn’t get a chance to say anything yesterday, with the coronation and everything, but... I guess I wanted to thank you. All of you.
You really helped me out, and you didn’t have to. So thanks.
Are you kidding? I was just being charitable, trying to help them with their fashion problems.
You really think I felt like joining that social leper colony? Please.

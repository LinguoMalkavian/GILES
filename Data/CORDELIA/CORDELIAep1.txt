Here.
Hi, I’m Cordelia.
If you’re looking for a textbook of your very own, there’s probably a few in the Library.
I’ll show you.
You transferred from Hemery, right? In L.A.?
Oh! I would kill to live in L.A. Being that close to that many shoes… Why’d you come here?
Well, you’ll be okay here. If you hang with me and mine you’ll be accepted in no time. Of course we do have to test your coolness factor. You’re from L.A., so you can skip the written, but, let’s see… Vamp nail polish.
SO over. James Spader.
Trendy but tasty. John Tesh.
Well, that was pretty much a gimme, but you passed.
Willow! Nice dress Good to know you’ve seen the softer side of Sears.
No wonder you’re such a guy-magnet. Are you done?
You wanna fit in here, the first rule is “know your losers”. Once you can identify them all by sight, they’re a lot easier to avoid.
--and if you’re not too swamped with catching up you should come out to the Bronze tonight.
The Bronze. It’s the only club worth going to around here. They let anybody in but it’s still the scene. It’s in the bad part of town.
About half a block from the good part of town. We don’t have a whole lot of town. You should show.
Good. I’ll see you at gym and you can tell me absolutely everything there is to know about yourself.
Are these people bothering you?
Oh, please. I don’t want to interrupt your downward mobility. I just thought I’d tell you that you won’t be meeting Coach Foster, the woman with chest hair, because gym has been canceled due to the extreme dead guy in the locker.
Some guy was stuffed in Aura’s locker.
Way dead.
Don’t you have an elsewhere to be?
I don’t know…
Morbid much? I didn’t ask!
What’s her deal?
My mom doesn’t even get out of bed anymore. The doctor says it’s Epstein Barr, I’m like, “ please , it’s chronic hepatitis or at least Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.” I mean nobody cool has Epstein Barr anymore.
Oh, yay, it’s my stalker.
Well, I’m glad we had this chat –
With you?
Well, uh, no.
Excuse me… could you be any weirder? Is there a more weirdness that you could have?
God, what is your childhood trauma?
Why? Did you need to attack her with a stick?
Excuse me. I have to call everyone that I’ve ever met right now. CUT TO:

Enough with the hyperbole.
You saw that, right? That wasn't me.
I have a dream. It's me on the Cheerleading Squad, adored by every Varsity male as far as the eye can see. We have to achieve our dreams, Amy, otherwise we wither and die.
Shhh. If your supreme klutziness out there today takes me out of the running you are going to be so very beyond sorry. Have a nice day.
You're lucky.
I made it.
I don't want to drive today, Mr. Pole.

What's happening?!? I can't see anything!
What's happening to me!?!
Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got bumped back to alternate. Hold it -- wait -- no I'm not.
Ooh, these grapes are sour.

It was a nightmare. A nightmare. They promised me we were going to St. Croix and then at the last minute, they just decide we're gonna visit Tuscany instead. Art. Buildings. Totally beachless for a month and a half. No one has suffered as I have suffered. Of course I think that kind of adversity builds character.

Buffy.
Ms. Calendar? Oh God...
Please... go away... what do you --
What an ordeal. And you know the worst part: It stays with you forever. No matter what they tell you, none of that rust and blood and grime comes out.

CORDELIA I hear you.

What was that?
Somebody's out there.
We could get in trouble, okay? I don't want to be grounded right before the dance. I AM the May Queen. Which means we get the first dance.
It's all in the AV room. The sound system, the decorations -- and Aura needs help moving the coolers.
Bring it to the Bronze and I'll meet you there in the morning to set it up.
You are so sweet. Why are you so sweet?
Willow! I'll see you in the morning. Willow! Hi. I like your outfit.
No, I really don't. But I need a favour.
The Bronze isn't letting us use their sound system and so I need someone who knows how to hook one up.
If you could just show up tomorrow morning I'd be really grateful, I mean I'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
Great. Tomorrow at ten.
Kevin said he'd bring everything to the Bronze last night. He promised! We'll never get everything ready in time.
You don't understand. I'm not mad. He totally flaked on me - on me - and I don't even mind. God help me, I think it's cute.
There they are.
They're watching cartoons. That's so - (stopping herself) it's not cute. It's annoying. I'm annoyed.
Men. I don't know why we put up with them.
Well Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
Get in!
I was sitting where Kevin and I used to park, and suddenly these things were coming at me -- I tried to get out but the gate's locked. Who are these guys?
What do we do?
Library. Right. Great.
OWWW!! Somebody HELP!
See how YOU like it.
Gone.
Yeah!
Oh, that was me saving the day.

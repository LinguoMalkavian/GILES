Half the school is out with this flu, Buffy. It's a serious deal. We're all worried about how gross you look.
What does that mean?
They won't let us in.
I think she wants to go.
Yuck.
I don't know... Lysette got her nose done here, you know; she asked for the Gwyneth Paltrow but it looked more like the Mr. Potato Head --
No, but while she's here she could get that thing taken care of. That thing on her face -- you know, that thing .
Am I the only one who's noticed that thing?
Nobody told me we were supposed to bring gifts. I was out of the loop on gifts.
Death?
But you do know it was death?
Okay, so this isn't about that you're afraid of hospitals cause your little friend died and you wanna conjure up a monster that you can fight and save everybody and not feel helpless?
Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.
You had to ask that, didn't you?
This is what happens when you try to be compassionate toward sick people. They take advantage of you.
I didn't want to be the first one to say it.
Right.
Stereotypes are so unfair.
I think security guards are way sexier than firemen. They're all so sooty.
Ooh, how thrilling. Do you get scared?
I bet you see a lot of tragedy, too. Like that little girl...
What's that?
I didn't hear anything.
Jealous?
What about you?
Oh, right, your obsession with protecting Buffy. Have I ever told you how attractive that's not?
Yeah, I've seen you watch her 'back.'
Well, you do!
Fine. Watch my back.
What do you mean, clean?
But you said you did see something the other night.
You sure didn't, though.
He's invisible.
Let's go, tact-guy. Be careful.
Ew. What's this one do?
Wow. What's this one do?
Ouch. What's this one do?
Boy, there's a demon for everything.
Well, it's not in here.
It's called 'Der Kindestod.'
It's me. I got your monster.
Looking up stuff.
Hey, I found this Kindestod guy. Just listen.
The name means 'Child Death.' This book says he feeds off of children by sucking the life out of them. Blech. But afterwards, it just looks like they died because they were sick.
That's my take. 'Cause it would be looking at that children's ward as basically an all-you-can-eat kind of thing.
Hence the slice-age.
EWW!
You should see how this thing does its things! I mean... ewww!

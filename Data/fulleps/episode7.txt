MASTER	Zackery didn't return from the hunt last night.
DARLA	The Slayer.
MASTER	Zackery was strong, and he was careful. And still the Slayer takes him, as she's taken so many of my family. It wears thin. Collin, what would you do about it?
COLLIN	I'd annihilate her.
MASTER	Out of the mouths of babes . . .
DARLA	Let me do it, Master, let me kill her for you.
MASTER	You have a personal interest in this . . .
DARLA	I never get to have any fun.
MASTER	I will send the Three.
DARLA	The Three.
WILLOW	Hard to believe it's the fumigation party already . . .
BUFFY	Hmm?
WILLOW	It's an annual tradition, the closing of the Bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches.
BUFFY	Oh.
WILLOW	It's a lot of fun. What's it like where you are?
BUFFY	I'm sorry. I was just . . . thinking about . . . things. And stuff.
WILLOW	Things and stuff. So we're talking about a guy.
BUFFY	Not exactly. For us to have a conversation about a guy there would have to be a guy for us to have a conversation about. Was that a sentence?
WILLOW	You lack a guy?
BUFFY	I do. Which is fine, most of the time, but . . .
WILLOW	What about Angel?
BUFFY	Angel. Yeah, I can see him in a relationship. "Hi honey, you're in grave danger, see you next month."
WILLOW	He doesn't stay around much, it's true.
BUFFY	He disappears! Every time. Tells me there's trouble then poof. Gone. But when he's around . . . It's like the lights dim everywhere else. You know how that happens with some guys?
WILLOW	Oh yeah.
CORDELIA	Please keep your extreme oafishness off my two hundred dollar shoes.
XANDER	Sorry. I was just --
CORDELIA	Getting off the floor before Annie Vega's boyfriend squashes you like a bug?
XANDER	Oh, you saw that. Well, thanks for being so understanding and -- I don't know what everyone's talking about, that outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker.
XANDER	Boy that Cordelia's a regular breath of vile air -- what are you vixens up to?
WILLOW	Just sitting here watching our barren lives pass us by. Oh look, a cockroach.
XANDER	Whoah, stop this crazy whirlygig of fun. I'm dizzy.
BUFFY	All right, now I'm infecting those near and dear to me. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
WILLOW	Don't go . . .
XANDER	Yeah, it's early! We could, um, dance.
BUFFY	Raincheck. Night.
WILLOW	Want a free drink?
BUFFY	It's late, I'm tired, I don't want to play games. Show yourself.
BUFFY	You really should talk to your orthodontist about a refund.
BUFFY	Hey, ow, okay, I'm letting go. I don't want to fight all three of you . . .
BUFFY	. . . unless I have to.
VOICE	Good dogs don't bite.
BUFFY	Look out!
BUFFY	Run!
BUFFY	Get in! Come on!
ANGEL	It's all right. A vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
BUFFY	I heard that, but I never put it to the test before.
BUFFY	I'll get some bandages, take your jacket and shirt off.
BUFFY	Nice tattoo.
BUFFY	I was lucky you came along. How did you happen to come along anyway?
ANGEL	I live nearby. I was just out walking.
BUFFY	So you weren't following me? I had this feeling you were . . .
ANGEL	Why would I do that?
BUFFY	You tell me, you're the Mystery Guy who appears out of nowhere -- I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight -- but if you are hanging around me I'd like to know why.
ANGEL	Maybe I like you.
BUFFY	"Maybe"?
JOYCE	Honey, what are you . . .?
BUFFY	There's a lot of weird people out at night, I just feel better with you safe and sound inside. (closes and locks door) You must be beat.
JOYCE	I am. I hate inventory, we're just a little gallery but you have no idea how much paper work --
BUFFY	Why don't you go upstairs, get in bed, I'll make you some hot tea --
JOYCE	That's sweet. What did you do?
BUFFY	What do you mean? I didn't do anything -- I'm concerned about your needs, can't a daughter --
JOYCE	Hi.
BUFFY	Oh. Mom, this is Angel, Angel this is my mom. I just happened to . . . run into him on my way home.
ANGEL	Hello, nice to meet you.
JOYCE	What do you do, Angel?
BUFFY	He's a student. First year community college. Angel's been helping me with my history. You know I've been toiling there.
JOYCE	It's a little late for tutoring. I'm going to bed and, Buffy?
BUFFY	I'll say goodnight and do the same.
JOYCE	Nice to meet you.
BUFFY	Good night, we'll hook up soon and do the study thing.
ANGEL	Look, I don't want to get you in any more trouble.
BUFFY	And I don't want to get you dead -- they could still be out there. So, one bed, two of us -- that doesn't work -- you're wounded, you take ANGEL I'll take the floor. (she gives him a look) Believe me, I've had worse.
BUFFY	Why don't you see if the Fang Gang is loitering and keep your back turned while I change.
ANGEL	I don't see them . . .
BUFFY	You know, I'm the Chosen One. It's my job to fight guys like that. What's your excuse?
ANGEL	Somebody has to.
BUFFY	Well, what does your family think of your career choice?
ANGEL	They're dead.
BUFFY	Was it vampires?
ANGEL	It was.
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
ANGEL	It was a long while ago.
BUFFY	So this is a vengeance gig for you?
ANGEL	You even look pretty when you go to sleep?
BUFFY	Well, when I wake up it's a whole different story. Sleep tight.
BUFFY	Angel?
ANGEL	Hmmm?
BUFFY	Do you snore?
ANGEL	I don't know, it's been a long time since anyone was in a position to let me know.
XANDER	In your room? In your bed?!
BUFFY	Not in my bed, by my bed.
WILLOW	That is so romantic.
XANDER	That is the moral decline that's eating our country out of house You know what I mean.
WILLOW	Wow. Did you, uh, I mean did he, uh . . .
BUFFY	Perfect gentleman.
XANDER	Oh come on, Buffy, wake up and smell the seduction, it's the oldest trick in the book.
BUFFY	Saving my life, getting slashed in the ribs?
XANDER	Duh. Guys'll do anything to impress a girl. I once drank an entire gallon of Gatorade without taking WILLOW It was pretty impressive. Although later on there was an ick factor --
GILES	-- Could I just steer this riveting conversation back to the events that took place earlier in the evening? You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires . . .
GILES	Did they look like this?
BUFFY	Yeah, what's with the uniforms?
GILES	You encountered the Three -- warrior vampires, very proud and strong.
WILLOW	How is it you always know this stuff? You always know what's going on -- I never know what's going on.
GILES	Yes, well, you weren't here from midnight to six researching it.
WILLOW	No, I was sleeping.
GILES	You're really starting to hurt the Master, he wouldn't send the Three for just anyone. We must step up our training with weapons . . .
XANDER	Buff, you better stay at my place until these Samurai-guys are history. Don't worry about Angel. Willow can run over to your house and tell him to get out of town fast.
GILES	Buffy and Angel aren't in immediate jeopardy. Eventually the Master will send others but the Three, having failed, will now offer up their own lives as penance.
XANDER	And what if he doesn't take their lives?
GILES	Oh right, I forgot, the Master's such a kind and forgiving sort of chap.
VAMP	We failed in our duty, our lives belong to you now.
MASTER	Pay attention, child, with power comes responsibility. True, they did fail, but also true: we who walk at night share a common bond. The taking of a life -- I'm not speaking about humans of course -- is a serious matter.
COLLIN	So you would spare them?
MASTER	I am weary and their deaths would bring me little joy.
MASTER	Of course, sometimes a little is enough.
VOICE	Cool, a crossbow.
BUFFY	And look at these babies, goodbye stakes, hello flying fatality. What can I shoot?
GILES	Nothing. The crossbow comes after you prove your proficiency with the jousting poles which, incidentally, training.
BUFFY	Giles, twentieth century, I'm not gonna be fighting Fryer Tuck.
GILES	You never know whom -- or what -- you may be fighting. And these traditions have been handed down through the ages, show me good, steady progress with the jousting and in due time we'll discuss the crossbow. Now put on your pads.
BUFFY	I'm not gonna need pads for you.
GILES	We'll see about that. En garde.
GILES	Good. Let's move on to the crossbow.
JOYCE	I have to call the exterminator, I heard mice or something upstairs today . . .
BUFFY	I bet they'll go away in a day or so -- are those new curtains?
JOYCE	Aunt Lolly made those when you were five.
BUFFY	What am I thinking? I know what I'm thinking, more protein. Your chicken rocks, Mom.
JOYCE	We have an appetite tonight. So tell me about this young man Angel. When are you going to see him again?
BUFFY	Soon . . .
JOYCE	He's doing more than helping you with your history, isn't he? I mean you've got Willow for that, plus I saw the way you looked at each other. We've talked about taking these things slowly. You know how a glacier moves a few feet every year? That kind of slowly.
BUFFY	Okay, so slower than you and Dad took it.
JOYCE	Touche'. Do you want to hear the lecture or do you know it by heart?
BUFFY	You were young, you were in love, what you weren't was through with college, focused on a career and . . . no help from the audience, please, in possession of your own identity.
JOYCE	That pretty much covers it. You cleaned your plate again?
BUFFY	Angel?
BUFFY	Don't do that. Brought you some dinner. (holds up baggie) It's a little plateless, what'd you do all day, anyway?
ANGEL	I read a little . . . . . . and just thought about a lot of things. Buffy, I --
BUFFY	-- my diary? You read my diary?
ANGEL	I --
BUFFY	-- That is not okay, a diary is a person's most private place and you don't even know what I was writing about, "Hunk" can mean a lot of things, bad things, and where it says your eyes are "penetrating" I meant to write "bulgy".
ANGEL	Buffy --
BUFFY	And for your information "A" does not stand for Angel, it stands for . . . Achmed, a charming foreign exchange student and so that whole fantasy part has nothing to do with --
ANGEL	Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up, I watched her from the closet. I didn't read it, I swear.
BUFFY	Oh. Ohhhhh.
ANGEL	I did a lot of thinking today, I can't really be around you . . .
ANGEL	Because when I am . . .
BUFFY	Hey, no big. Water over the bridge --
ANGEL	. . . all I can think about is how badly I want to kiss you --
BUFFY	-- it's under the bridge, over the dam, kiss me?
ANGEL	I'm older than you and this can't ever . . . (opens window) . . . I better go.
BUFFY	. . . how much older?
ANGEL	I really should . . .
BUFFY	Go, you said.
JOYCE	Buffy, what happened?
BUFFY	Nothing . . . I saw a shadow.
WILLOW	Angel's a vampire?
BUFFY	I can't believe this is happening . . . one minute we're kissing, the next minute . . . . . . can a vampire ever been a good person? Couldn't it happen?
GILES	A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, the memories, even the personality of the person it takes over, but it is a demon at the core. There's no halfway.
WILLOW	So that's a no, huh?
BUFFY	Well then what was he doing? Why was he . . . good to me? Was it all some part of the Master's plan? It doesn't make sense .
XANDER	All right, you have a problem and it's not a small one. Let's just take a breath and look at this calmly and objectively.
XANDER	Angel's a vampire, you're a Slayer -- it's obvious what you have to do.
GILES	It is the Slayer's duty.
XANDER	I know you have feelings but it's not like you're in love with him or anything, right?
XANDER	You're in love with a vampire?! Are you out of your mind?
XANDER	Not vampire, I mean . . . How can you love an umpire? Everybody hates them!
CORDELIA	Where did you get that dress?!
CORDELIA	This is a one of a kind Todd Oldham. Do you have any idea how much it cost?
CORDELIA	It's a knock-off, isn't it?
CORDELIA	It's a cheesy knock-off. This is what happens when you sign these Free Trade Agreements . . .
BUFFY	And we think we have problems.
WILLOW	Oh boy, time for geometry. (off Xander and Buffy's looks) It's fun if you make it fun.
WILLOW	Geometry's starting.
XANDER	Yup.
WILLOW	But you're out here drinking.
XANDER	Again I say, yup.
WILLOW	Something's bothering you. Buffy.
XANDER	Buffy? Why would Buffy be bothering me?
WILLOW	Cause you kinda got a thing there and she kinda has a thing . . . elsewhere.
XANDER	It's just . . . this guy Angel, the research is in, he's a vampire -- still she likes him better than me.
WILLOW	She doesn't like him 'cause he's a vampire, I know she's not down with that part.
XANDER	Love sucks. Ever since I was in grammar school it's the same old dance . . . you dig someone, they dig someone else. And then that someone else digs someone else.
WILLOW	That's the dance.
XANDER	I mean, I'm right for her. I'm the guy. I know it. She's so stupid! She's not stupid. But . . . it's too much. We're such good buds, I'm this close to her, and she doesn't have a clue how I feel. And wouldn't care if she did. It's killing me.
WILLOW	Gee, what's that like?
ANGEL	Who's here?
DARLA	Hi. It's been a while.
ANGEL	A lifetime.
DARLA	Or two, but who's counting.
ANGEL	What's with the Catholic-School Girl look. Last time I saw you it was Kimonos.
DARLA	And last time I saw you it wasn't high school girls. Don't cha' like? Remember Budapest, turn of the century, you were such a bad boy during that earthquake.
ANGEL	You did some damage yourself.
DARLA	Is there anything better than a natural disaster: the panic, the people lost in the streets, like picking fruit off the vine.
DARLA	Nice. You're living above ground, like one of them. You and your new friend are attacking us, like one of them. But guess what, precious, you're not once of them . . .
DARLA	. . . are you?
ANGEL	No, but I'm not exactly one of you, either.
DARLA	Is that what you tell yourself these days? You and I both know the things you hunger for, the things you need. Hey, nothing to be ashamed of, it's who we are, it's what makes Eternal life worth living. You can only suppress your real nature for so long . . . I can feel it brewing inside you. I hope I'm around when it explodes.
ANGEL	Maybe you don't want to be.
DARLA	I'm not afraid of you. I'll bet she is, though.
DARLA	Or maybe I'm underestimating her. Talk to her. Tell her about the curse. Maybe she'll come around. And if she still doesn't trust you . . . you know where I'll be.
XANDER	Can you please warn us before you do that?
GILES	Nothing about Angel in the texts, but then it occurred to me it's been ages since I read the diaries of the Watchers who came before me.
WILLOW	That must have been so embarrassing when you thought he'd read your diary but then he hadn't but then it turned out he felt the same way that -- -- I'm listening.
GILES	There's mention over two hundred years ago in Ireland of Angelus, the one with the angelic face.
BUFFY	They got that right.
XANDER	I'm not saying anything, I have nothing to say.
GILES	Does your Angel -- this Angel -- have a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
BUFFY	A bird or something.
XANDER	Now I'm saying something. You saw him naked ?
WILLOW	So Angel's been around for a while.
GILES	Not that long for a vampire, two hundred and forty years or so.
BUFFY	Two hundred and forty. Well, he did say he was older.
GILES	Angelus leaves Ireland, wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades. Then, about eighty years ago, a most curious thing happens . . . . . . he comes to America where he shuns other vampires and lives alone. There's no record of him hunting here . . .
WILLOW	So he is a good vampire. I mean on a scale of one to ten, ten being someone who's out there killing and maiming every night and one being someone who's . . . not . . .
GILES	There's no record but . . . vampires hunt and kill, it's what they do.
XANDER	Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
BUFFY	He could have fed on me, he didn't.
XANDER	Question, the hundred years or so before he came to our shores, what was he like then?
GILES	Like all of them, a vicious, violent animal.
DARLA	Don't think I'm not grateful, you letting me kill the Three . . .
MASTER	How can my children learn if I do everything for them?
DARLA	But you've got to let me take care of the Slayer.
MASTER	Oh, you're giving me orders now.
DARLA	Okay, let's just do nothing while she takes us out one by one.
MASTER	Do I sense a plan, Darla? Share.
DARLA	Angel kills her and comes back to the fold.
MASTER	Angel. He was the most vicious creature I ever met. I miss him.
DARLA	So do I.
MASTER	Why would he kill her if he feels for her?
DARLA	To keep her from killing him.
MASTER	You see how we all work together for the common good? That's how a family is supposed to function.
WILLOW	Okay, so Reconstruction began, when? Buffy?
BUFFY	Huh? Reconstruction? It began after the, ah, construction which was shoddy and so they had to reconstruct --
WILLOW	After the destruction of the Civil War.
BUFFY	Right. The Civil War, during which Angel was already like a hundred and change.
WILLOW	Are we going to talk about boys or are we going to help you pass history? Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander is going to just grab me and kiss me, right on the lips.
BUFFY	You want Xander to . . . you got to speak up, girl.
WILLOW	No, no, no. No speaking up. That way leads to madness and sweaty palms.
WILLOW	Okay, here's something I gotta know: when Angel kissed you, I mean before he turned into . . . how was it?
BUFFY	Unbelievable.
WILLOW	Wow. And it is kind of novel how he'll stay young and handsome forever -- although you'll still get wrinkly and die -- oooo, and what about the children -- I'll be quiet now.
BUFFY	No, speak up. I've got to get over him so I can . . .
WILLOW	So you can . . .?
BUFFY	Like Xander said, I'm a Slayer, he's a vampire. Oh god, I can't. He's never done anything to hurt me. I gotta stop thinking about this. Give me another half hour, maybe something will sink in. Then I'm going home for some major moping.
WILLOW	The era of congressional Reconstruction, usually called Radical Reconstruction, lasted ten years . . .
JOYCE	Buffy?
JOYCE	Hello . . .?
DARLA	Hi. I'm Darla, a friend of Buffy's?
JOYCE	Oh, nice to meet you.
DARLA	She didn't mention anything about me coming over for a study date?
JOYCE	No. I thought she was studying with Willow at the library.
DARLA	Oh, she is, Willow's the Civil War expert, but then I was supposed to help her with the War of Independence. My family kind of goes back to those days.
JOYCE	I know she's supposed to be home soon. Would you like to come in and wait?
DARLA	That's very nice of you to invite me into your home.
JOYCE	. . . you're welcome. (Darla enters; re: paperwork) I've been wrestling the I.R.S. all night -- would you like something to eat?
DARLA	JOYCE Let's see what we have.
JOYCE	Do you feel like something little or something big?
DARLA	Something big.
ANGEL	Let her go.
DARLA	I only took a little, there's plenty more. Aren'tcha hungry for something warm after all this time?
DARLA	Come on, Angel . . .
DARLA	Just say yes.
DARLA	Welcome home.
BUFFY	. . . I'm home.
BUFFY	You're not welcome here. Come near us and I'll kill you.
BUFFY	Mom, mom can you hear me?
BUFFY	I need an ambulance, sixteen-thirty Revello Drive. My mother . . . cut herself, she's lost a lot of blood . . . please hurry --
XANDER	Hey, Buffy, we -- Oh my god.
WILLOW	What happened?
BUFFY	Angel.
BUFFY	Do you remember anything, mom?
JOYCE	Just . . . your friend came over, I was going to make a snack . . .
BUFFY	My friend . . .
JOYCE	I guess I slipped and cut my neck on . . . the doctor said it looked like a barbeque fork, we don't have a barbeque fork . . . Are you another doctor?
BUFFY	Mom, this is Mr. Giles.
JOYCE	The librarian from your school? What's he . . .?
GILES	I just came to pay my respects, wish you a speedy recovery.
JOYCE	Boy, the teachers really do care in this town . . .
BUFFY	Mom, get some rest now.
BUFFY	The doctor says she's going to be okay. They gave her some iron, her blood count's a little . . .
GILES	A little low, it presents like a mild anemia . . . you're lucky you got to her as soon as you did.
BUFFY	Lucky and oh-so-stupid.
XANDER	Buff, this isn't your fault.
BUFFY	Oh no? I invited him into my home. And even after I knew who he was -- what he was -- I didn't do anything about it. Because I had feelings , because I cared about him .
WILLOW	If you care about somebody . . . . . . you care about them. You can't change that just by --
BUFFY	Killing them? Maybe not, but it's a start.
XANDER	We'll keep an eye on your mom.
BUFFY	Thanks. The Three found me near the Bronze and so did he. He lives nearby . . .
GILES	This is no ordinary vampire -- if there is such a thing -- he knows you, he's faced the Three, I think it's going to take more than simple stake.
BUFFY	So do I.
DARLA	She's out hunting you right now. She wants to kill you.
ANGEL	Leave me alone.
DARLA	What did you think? Did you think she'd understand? That she would look at your face -- your true face -- and give you a kiss?
DARLA	For a hundred years you've not had a moment's peace 'cause you will not accept who you are. That's all you have to do. Accept it. Don't let her hunt you down, don't whimper and mewl like a mangy human. Kill. Feed. Live .
ANGEL	All right .
DARLA	What do you want?
ANGEL	I want it finished.
DARLA	That's good. You're hurting me. That's good, too . . .
GILES	What?
XANDER	Why do they call it tweed?
WILLOW	Buffy's mom is asking for you.
JOYCE	She talks about you all the time . . . it's important to have teachers who make an impression . . .
GILES	She makes quite an impression herself.
JOYCE	I know she's having trouble with history. Is it too difficult for her or is she not applying herself?
GILES	She lives very much in the now and of course history is very much about "the then", but there's no reason . . .
JOYCE	She's studying with Willow, she's studying with Darla, she is trying . . .
GILES	Darla. I don't believe I know . . .
JOYCE	Her friend, the one who came over tonight.
GILES	Darla came to your house tonight, she was the friend you mentioned earlier?
JOYCE	Poor thing, I probably frightened her half to death when I fainted. Someone should make sure she's all right.
GILES	Yes, someone should, right away. I'll do it.
JOYCE	That school is amazing.
GILES	We've got a problem.
BUFFY	I know you're there . . .
BUFFY	And I finally know what you are.
VOICE	Do you . . .
VOICE	I'm just an animal, right?
BUFFY	You're not an animal. Animals I like.
ANGEL	Let's get it done.
ANGEL	Come on. Don't go soft on me now.
ANGEL	A little wide . . .
BUFFY	Why? Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? Was it just a joke? To make me feel for you and then . . . I've killed a lot of vampires. I've never hated one before.
ANGEL	Feels good, doesn't it? Feels simple.
BUFFY	You play me like a fool. Come into my home. And then you attack my family . . .
ANGEL	Why not? I killed mine.
ANGEL	I killed their friends, and their friends' children. For a hundred years I offered an ugly death to everyone I met. And I did it with a song in my heart.
BUFFY	A hundred years.
ANGEL	And then I made an error of judgment. Fed on a girl about your age. Beautiful. Dumb as a post, but a favorite among her clan.
BUFFY	Her clan?
ANGEL	The Romani -- -- Gypsies. It was just before the turn of the century. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.
BUFFY	What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?
ANGEL	When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body. But it doesn't get the soul. That's gone. No conscience, no remorse . . . it's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done, and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being since that day.
BUFFY	So you start with my mom? Am I supposed to feel honored?
ANGEL	I didn't bite her.
BUFFY	Then why didn't you say something --
ANGEL	But I wanted to. I can walk like a man but I'm not one. I wanted to kill you tonight.
BUFFY	Then go ahead.
BUFFY	Not as easy as it looks.
WILLOW	We're near the Bronze, what now?
GILES	Keep looking for her.
XANDER	Okay, here's a question. Say we find her. Say she's fighting Angel or some of his friends. What the heck are we going to do about it ?
GILES	We have to stop her before it's too late.
XANDER	You couldn't just give her a cell phone for Christmas, could you.
DARLA	Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?
BUFFY	Bad hair on top of that outfit?
BUFFY	So you guys were . . . involved.
DARLA	For several generations.
BUFFY	Well you're going to pile up a few ex's when you've been around since Columbus. You are older than him, right? One gal to another, you look a little worn around the eyes.
DARLA	I made him. And I brought him that Gypsy girl . . . there was a time when we shared everything. Wasn't there, Angelus.
DARLA	You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for a thousand years. You gave all that up because of her, you love someone who hates us .
DARLA	You're sick and you'll always be sick and you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die. You don't think I came alone do you?
BUFFY	I know I didn't.
DARLA	Scary.
DARLA	Scarier.
BUFFY	Angel!
DARLA	Don't worry, bullets can't kill vampires -- (re: Angel, writhing on the floor) -- they can hurt like hell, but --
XANDER	Did you just hear --
DARLA	So many body parts, so few bullets . . . let's begin with the kneecaps, no fun dancing without them . . .
DARLA	Close. But no heart.
XANDER	We need to distract her.
WILLOW	Buffy, it wasn't Angel who attacked your mom, it was Darla!
XANDER	Good, enough distraction!
XANDER	I don't think we can save her with Disco Fever . . . Oooo, strobes . . .
DARLA	Come on, Buffy . . . Take it like a man.
DARLA	Angel . . .
MASTER	Darla . . .
COLLIN	Forget her.
MASTER	How dare you! She was my favorite! For four hundred years --
COLLIN	She was weak. We don't need her. I will bring you the Slayer.
MASTER	But to lose her to Angel . . . He was to have sat on my right come the day . . . and now . . .
COLLIN	They're all against you. But soon you'll rise and when you do . . .
COLLIN	We'll kill them all.
BUFFY	Here Mom, you gotta eat this. It's what the doctor said, to build up your iron. How are you feeling?
JOYCE	I'm thinking I should say not so good so you'll continue to wait on me hand and foot but I cannot tell a lie: I feel fine.
BUFFY	Good. I was so worried about you, I mean it actually made me feel sick. If anything happened to you . . .
JOYCE	Now you know how I feel about you every minute of every day.
BUFFY	I guess I do. Ouch, and now I am so sorry for about a kazillion things I've put you through.
BUFFY	Now eat your vegetables.
JOYCE	I did!
BUFFY	Mom . . .
JOYCE	I had two big bites.
XANDER	Ah, the post-fumigation party.
BUFFY	What's the difference between this and the pre-fumigation party?
XANDER	Much heartier cockroaches.
WILLOW	No word from Angel?
BUFFY	No. I don't think he'll be around. It's weird, though. In a way I feel like he's still watching me.
WILLOW	Well, in a way, he is. In the way of that he's right over there.
XANDER	I don't need to watch because I'm not threatened. I'm gonna look this way.
ANGEL	I just wanted to make sure you're okay, and your mother . . .
BUFFY	We're both good. You?
ANGEL	If I can go a little while without getting shot or stabbed I'll be all right.
ANGEL	Look . . . this can't . . .
BUFFY	I know, ever be anything. For one thing you're like two hundred and twenty-four years older than I am.
ANGEL	I just gotta . . . I gotta walk away from this.
BUFFY	I know. Me, too.
BUFFY	One of us has to go here.
ANGEL	I know.
XANDER	What's going on?
WILLOW	Nothing.
XANDER	Well, as long as they're not kissing . . .
BUFFY	Are you okay?
ANGEL	It's just . . .
BUFFY	Painful, I know . . . I'll see you around.
MASTER	Zackery didn't return from the hunt last night.
DARLA	The Slayer.
MASTER	Zackery was strong, and he was careful. And still the Slayer takes him, as she's taken so many of my family. It wears thin. Collin, what would you do about it?
COLLIN	I'd annihilate her.
MASTER	Out of the mouths of babes . . .
DARLA	Let me do it, Master, let me kill her for you.
MASTER	You have a personal interest in this . . .
DARLA	I never get to have any fun.
MASTER	I will send the Three.
WILLOW	Hard to believe it's the fumigation party already . . .
BUFFY	Hmm?
WILLOW	It's an annual tradition, the closing of the Bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches.
BUFFY	Oh.
WILLOW	It's a lot of fun. What's it like where you are?
BUFFY	I'm sorry. I was just . . . thinking about . . . things. And stuff.
WILLOW	Things and stuff. So we're talking about a guy.
BUFFY	Not exactly. For us to have a conversation about a guy there would have to be a guy for us to have a conversation about. Was that a sentence?
WILLOW	You lack a guy?
BUFFY	I do. Which is fine, most of the time, but . . .
WILLOW	What about Angel?
BUFFY	Angel. Yeah, I can see him in a relationship. "Hi honey, you're in grave danger, see you next month."
WILLOW	He doesn't stay around much, it's true.
BUFFY	He disappears! Every time. Tells me there's trouble then poof. Gone. But when he's around . . . It's like the lights dim everywhere else. You know how that happens with some guys?
WILLOW	Oh yeah.
CORDELIA	Please keep your extreme oafishness off my two hundred dollar shoes.
XANDER	Sorry. I was just --
CORDELIA	Getting off the floor before Annie Vega's boyfriend squashes you like a bug?
XANDER	Oh, you saw that. Well, thanks for being so understanding and -- I don't know what everyone's talking about, that outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker.
XANDER	Boy that Cordelia's a regular breath of vile air -- what are you vixens up to?
WILLOW	Just sitting here watching our barren lives pass us by. Oh look, a cockroach.
XANDER	Whoah, stop this crazy whirlygig of fun. I'm dizzy.
BUFFY	All right, now I'm infecting those near and dear to me. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
WILLOW	Don't go . . .
XANDER	Yeah, it's early! We could, um, dance.
BUFFY	Raincheck. Night.
ANGEL	It's all right. A vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
BUFFY	I heard that, but I never put it to the test before.
BUFFY	I was lucky you came along. How did you happen to come along anyway?
ANGEL	I live nearby. I was just out walking.
BUFFY	So you weren't following me? I had this feeling you were . . .
ANGEL	Why would I do that?
BUFFY	You tell me, you're the Mystery Guy who appears out of nowhere -- I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight -- but if you are hanging around me I'd like to know why.
ANGEL	Maybe I like you.
BUFFY	"Maybe"?
JOYCE	Honey, what are you . . .?
BUFFY	There's a lot of weird people out at night, I just feel better with you safe and sound inside. (closes and locks door) You must be beat.
JOYCE	I am. I hate inventory, we're just a little gallery but you have no idea how much paper work --
BUFFY	Why don't you go upstairs, get in bed, I'll make you some hot tea --
JOYCE	That's sweet. What did you do?
BUFFY	What do you mean? I didn't do anything -- I'm concerned about your needs, can't a daughter --
JOYCE	Hi.
BUFFY	Oh. Mom, this is Angel, Angel this is my mom. I just happened to . . . run into him on my way home.
ANGEL	Hello, nice to meet you.
JOYCE	What do you do, Angel?
BUFFY	He's a student. First year community college. Angel's been helping me with my history. You know I've been toiling there.
JOYCE	It's a little late for tutoring. I'm going to bed and, Buffy?
BUFFY	I'll say goodnight and do the same.
JOYCE	Nice to meet you.
ANGEL	Look, I don't want to get you in any more trouble.
BUFFY	And I don't want to get you dead -- they could still be out there. So, one bed, two of us -- that doesn't work -- you're wounded, you take ANGEL I'll take the floor. (she gives him a look) Believe me, I've had worse.
BUFFY	Why don't you see if the Fang Gang is loitering and keep your back turned while I change.
ANGEL	I don't see them . . .
BUFFY	You know, I'm the Chosen One. It's my job to fight guys like that. What's your excuse?
ANGEL	Somebody has to.
BUFFY	Well, what does your family think of your career choice?
ANGEL	They're dead.
BUFFY	Was it vampires?
ANGEL	It was.
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
ANGEL	It was a long while ago.
BUFFY	So this is a vengeance gig for you?
ANGEL	You even look pretty when you go to sleep?
BUFFY	Well, when I wake up it's a whole different story. Sleep tight.
BUFFY	Angel?
ANGEL	Hmmm?
BUFFY	Do you snore?
ANGEL	I don't know, it's been a long time since anyone was in a position to let me know.
XANDER	In your room? In your bed?!
BUFFY	Not in my bed, by my bed.
WILLOW	That is so romantic.
XANDER	That is the moral decline that's eating our country out of house You know what I mean.
WILLOW	Wow. Did you, uh, I mean did he, uh . . .
BUFFY	Perfect gentleman.
XANDER	Oh come on, Buffy, wake up and smell the seduction, it's the oldest trick in the book.
BUFFY	Saving my life, getting slashed in the ribs?
XANDER	Duh. Guys'll do anything to impress a girl. I once drank an entire gallon of Gatorade without taking WILLOW It was pretty impressive. Although later on there was an ick factor --
GILES	-- Could I just steer this riveting conversation back to the events that took place earlier in the evening? You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires . . .
GILES	Did they look like this?
BUFFY	Yeah, what's with the uniforms?
GILES	You encountered the Three -- warrior vampires, very proud and strong.
WILLOW	How is it you always know this stuff? You always know what's going on -- I never know what's going on.
GILES	Yes, well, you weren't here from midnight to six researching it.
WILLOW	No, I was sleeping.
GILES	You're really starting to hurt the Master, he wouldn't send the Three for just anyone. We must step up our training with weapons . . .
XANDER	Buff, you better stay at my place until these Samurai-guys are history. Don't worry about Angel. Willow can run over to your house and tell him to get out of town fast.
GILES	Buffy and Angel aren't in immediate jeopardy. Eventually the Master will send others but the Three, having failed, will now offer up their own lives as penance.
XANDER	And what if he doesn't take their lives?
GILES	Oh right, I forgot, the Master's such a kind and forgiving sort of chap.
BUFFY	And look at these babies, goodbye stakes, hello flying fatality. What can I shoot?
GILES	Nothing. The crossbow comes after you prove your proficiency with the jousting poles which, incidentally, training.
BUFFY	Giles, twentieth century, I'm not gonna be fighting Fryer Tuck.
GILES	You never know whom -- or what -- you may be fighting. And these traditions have been handed down through the ages, show me good, steady progress with the jousting and in due time we'll discuss the crossbow. Now put on your pads.
BUFFY	I'm not gonna need pads for you.
GILES	We'll see about that. En garde.
JOYCE	I have to call the exterminator, I heard mice or something upstairs today . . .
BUFFY	I bet they'll go away in a day or so -- are those new curtains?
JOYCE	Aunt Lolly made those when you were five.
BUFFY	What am I thinking? I know what I'm thinking, more protein. Your chicken rocks, Mom.
JOYCE	We have an appetite tonight. So tell me about this young man Angel. When are you going to see him again?
BUFFY	Soon . . .
JOYCE	He's doing more than helping you with your history, isn't he? I mean you've got Willow for that, plus I saw the way you looked at each other. We've talked about taking these things slowly. You know how a glacier moves a few feet every year? That kind of slowly.
BUFFY	Okay, so slower than you and Dad took it.
JOYCE	Touche'. Do you want to hear the lecture or do you know it by heart?
BUFFY	You were young, you were in love, what you weren't was through with college, focused on a career and . . . no help from the audience, please, in possession of your own identity.
JOYCE	That pretty much covers it. You cleaned your plate again?
BUFFY	Don't do that. Brought you some dinner. (holds up baggie) It's a little plateless, what'd you do all day, anyway?
ANGEL	I read a little . . . . . . and just thought about a lot of things. Buffy, I --
BUFFY	-- my diary? You read my diary?
ANGEL	I --
BUFFY	-- That is not okay, a diary is a person's most private place and you don't even know what I was writing about, "Hunk" can mean a lot of things, bad things, and where it says your eyes are "penetrating" I meant to write "bulgy".
ANGEL	Buffy --
BUFFY	And for your information "A" does not stand for Angel, it stands for . . . Achmed, a charming foreign exchange student and so that whole fantasy part has nothing to do with --
ANGEL	Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up, I watched her from the closet. I didn't read it, I swear.
BUFFY	Oh. Ohhhhh.
ANGEL	I did a lot of thinking today, I can't really be around you . . .
ANGEL	Because when I am . . .
BUFFY	Hey, no big. Water over the bridge --
ANGEL	. . . all I can think about is how badly I want to kiss you --
BUFFY	-- it's under the bridge, over the dam, kiss me?
ANGEL	I'm older than you and this can't ever . . . (opens window) . . . I better go.
BUFFY	. . . how much older?
ANGEL	I really should . . .
BUFFY	Go, you said.
JOYCE	Buffy, what happened?
BUFFY	Nothing . . . I saw a shadow.
WILLOW	Angel's a vampire?
BUFFY	I can't believe this is happening . . . one minute we're kissing, the next minute . . . . . . can a vampire ever been a good person? Couldn't it happen?
GILES	A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, the memories, even the personality of the person it takes over, but it is a demon at the core. There's no halfway.
WILLOW	So that's a no, huh?
BUFFY	Well then what was he doing? Why was he . . . good to me? Was it all some part of the Master's plan? It doesn't make sense .
XANDER	Not vampire, I mean . . . How can you love an umpire? Everybody hates them!
CORDELIA	Where did you get that dress?!
WILLOW	Geometry's starting.
XANDER	Yup.
WILLOW	But you're out here drinking.
XANDER	Again I say, yup.
WILLOW	Something's bothering you. Buffy.
XANDER	Buffy? Why would Buffy be bothering me?
WILLOW	Cause you kinda got a thing there and she kinda has a thing . . . elsewhere.
XANDER	It's just . . . this guy Angel, the research is in, he's a vampire -- still she likes him better than me.
WILLOW	She doesn't like him 'cause he's a vampire, I know she's not down with that part.
XANDER	Love sucks. Ever since I was in grammar school it's the same old dance . . . you dig someone, they dig someone else. And then that someone else digs someone else.
WILLOW	That's the dance.
XANDER	I mean, I'm right for her. I'm the guy. I know it. She's so stupid! She's not stupid. But . . . it's too much. We're such good buds, I'm this close to her, and she doesn't have a clue how I feel. And wouldn't care if she did. It's killing me.
ANGEL	Who's here?
DARLA	Hi. It's been a while.
ANGEL	A lifetime.
DARLA	Or two, but who's counting.
ANGEL	What's with the Catholic-School Girl look. Last time I saw you it was Kimonos.
DARLA	And last time I saw you it wasn't high school girls. Don't cha' like? Remember Budapest, turn of the century, you were such a bad boy during that earthquake.
ANGEL	You did some damage yourself.
DARLA	Is there anything better than a natural disaster: the panic, the people lost in the streets, like picking fruit off the vine.
DARLA	. . . are you?
ANGEL	No, but I'm not exactly one of you, either.
DARLA	Is that what you tell yourself these days? You and I both know the things you hunger for, the things you need. Hey, nothing to be ashamed of, it's who we are, it's what makes Eternal life worth living. You can only suppress your real nature for so long . . . I can feel it brewing inside you. I hope I'm around when it explodes.
ANGEL	Maybe you don't want to be.
DARLA	I'm not afraid of you. I'll bet she is, though.
GILES	Nothing about Angel in the texts, but then it occurred to me it's been ages since I read the diaries of the Watchers who came before me.
WILLOW	That must have been so embarrassing when you thought he'd read your diary but then he hadn't but then it turned out he felt the same way that -- -- I'm listening.
GILES	There's mention over two hundred years ago in Ireland of Angelus, the one with the angelic face.
BUFFY	They got that right.
XANDER	I'm not saying anything, I have nothing to say.
GILES	Does your Angel -- this Angel -- have a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
BUFFY	A bird or something.
XANDER	Now I'm saying something. You saw him naked ?
WILLOW	So Angel's been around for a while.
GILES	Not that long for a vampire, two hundred and forty years or so.
BUFFY	Two hundred and forty. Well, he did say he was older.
GILES	Angelus leaves Ireland, wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades. Then, about eighty years ago, a most curious thing happens . . . . . . he comes to America where he shuns other vampires and lives alone. There's no record of him hunting here . . .
WILLOW	So he is a good vampire. I mean on a scale of one to ten, ten being someone who's out there killing and maiming every night and one being someone who's . . . not . . .
GILES	There's no record but . . . vampires hunt and kill, it's what they do.
XANDER	Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
BUFFY	He could have fed on me, he didn't.
XANDER	Question, the hundred years or so before he came to our shores, what was he like then?
GILES	Like all of them, a vicious, violent animal.
DARLA	Don't think I'm not grateful, you letting me kill the Three . . .
MASTER	How can my children learn if I do everything for them?
DARLA	But you've got to let me take care of the Slayer.
MASTER	Oh, you're giving me orders now.
DARLA	Okay, let's just do nothing while she takes us out one by one.
MASTER	Do I sense a plan, Darla? Share.
DARLA	Angel kills her and comes back to the fold.
MASTER	Angel. He was the most vicious creature I ever met. I miss him.
DARLA	So do I.
MASTER	Why would he kill her if he feels for her?
DARLA	To keep her from killing him.
WILLOW	Okay, so Reconstruction began, when? Buffy?
BUFFY	Huh? Reconstruction? It began after the, ah, construction which was shoddy and so they had to reconstruct --
WILLOW	After the destruction of the Civil War.
BUFFY	Right. The Civil War, during which Angel was already like a hundred and change.
WILLOW	Are we going to talk about boys or are we going to help you pass history? Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander is going to just grab me and kiss me, right on the lips.
BUFFY	You want Xander to . . . you got to speak up, girl.
WILLOW	No, no, no. No speaking up. That way leads to madness and sweaty palms.
WILLOW	Okay, here's something I gotta know: when Angel kissed you, I mean before he turned into . . . how was it?
BUFFY	Unbelievable.
WILLOW	Wow. And it is kind of novel how he'll stay young and handsome forever -- although you'll still get wrinkly and die -- oooo, and what about the children -- I'll be quiet now.
BUFFY	No, speak up. I've got to get over him so I can . . .
WILLOW	So you can . . .?
JOYCE	Hello . . .?
DARLA	Hi. I'm Darla, a friend of Buffy's?
JOYCE	Oh, nice to meet you.
DARLA	She didn't mention anything about me coming over for a study date?
JOYCE	No. I thought she was studying with Willow at the library.
DARLA	Oh, she is, Willow's the Civil War expert, but then I was supposed to help her with the War of Independence. My family kind of goes back to those days.
JOYCE	I know she's supposed to be home soon. Would you like to come in and wait?
DARLA	That's very nice of you to invite me into your home.
JOYCE	. . . you're welcome. (Darla enters; re: paperwork) I've been wrestling the I.R.S. all night -- would you like something to eat?
DARLA	JOYCE Let's see what we have.
JOYCE	Do you feel like something little or something big?
DARLA	Something big.
XANDER	Hey, Buffy, we -- Oh my god.
WILLOW	What happened?
BUFFY	Angel.
BUFFY	Do you remember anything, mom?
JOYCE	Just . . . your friend came over, I was going to make a snack . . .
BUFFY	My friend . . .
JOYCE	I guess I slipped and cut my neck on . . . the doctor said it looked like a barbeque fork, we don't have a barbeque fork . . . Are you another doctor?
BUFFY	Mom, this is Mr. Giles.
JOYCE	The librarian from your school? What's he . . .?
GILES	I just came to pay my respects, wish you a speedy recovery.
JOYCE	Boy, the teachers really do care in this town . . .
BUFFY	Mom, get some rest now.
GILES	A little low, it presents like a mild anemia . . . you're lucky you got to her as soon as you did.
BUFFY	Lucky and oh-so-stupid.
XANDER	Buff, this isn't your fault.
BUFFY	Oh no? I invited him into my home. And even after I knew who he was -- what he was -- I didn't do anything about it. Because I had feelings , because I cared about him .
WILLOW	If you care about somebody . . . . . . you care about them. You can't change that just by --
BUFFY	Killing them? Maybe not, but it's a start.
XANDER	We'll keep an eye on your mom.
BUFFY	Thanks. The Three found me near the Bronze and so did he. He lives nearby . . .
GILES	This is no ordinary vampire -- if there is such a thing -- he knows you, he's faced the Three, I think it's going to take more than simple stake.
BUFFY	So do I.
DARLA	She's out hunting you right now. She wants to kill you.
ANGEL	Leave me alone.
DARLA	What did you think? Did you think she'd understand? That she would look at your face -- your true face -- and give you a kiss?
ANGEL	All right .
DARLA	What do you want?
ANGEL	I want it finished.
DARLA	That's good. You're hurting me. That's good, too . . .
GILES	What?
XANDER	Why do they call it tweed?
JOYCE	She talks about you all the time . . . it's important to have teachers who make an impression . . .
GILES	She makes quite an impression herself.
JOYCE	I know she's having trouble with history. Is it too difficult for her or is she not applying herself?
GILES	She lives very much in the now and of course history is very much about "the then", but there's no reason . . .
JOYCE	She's studying with Willow, she's studying with Darla, she is trying . . .
GILES	Darla. I don't believe I know . . .
JOYCE	Her friend, the one who came over tonight.
GILES	Darla came to your house tonight, she was the friend you mentioned earlier?
JOYCE	Poor thing, I probably frightened her half to death when I fainted. Someone should make sure she's all right.
GILES	Yes, someone should, right away. I'll do it.
BUFFY	And I finally know what you are.
VOICE	Do you . . .
VOICE	I'm just an animal, right?
BUFFY	You're not an animal. Animals I like.
ANGEL	A little wide . . .
BUFFY	Why? Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? Was it just a joke? To make me feel for you and then . . . I've killed a lot of vampires. I've never hated one before.
ANGEL	Feels good, doesn't it? Feels simple.
BUFFY	You play me like a fool. Come into my home. And then you attack my family . . .
ANGEL	Why not? I killed mine.
ANGEL	I killed their friends, and their friends' children. For a hundred years I offered an ugly death to everyone I met. And I did it with a song in my heart.
BUFFY	A hundred years.
ANGEL	And then I made an error of judgment. Fed on a girl about your age. Beautiful. Dumb as a post, but a favorite among her clan.
BUFFY	Her clan?
ANGEL	The Romani -- -- Gypsies. It was just before the turn of the century. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.
BUFFY	What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?
ANGEL	When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body. But it doesn't get the soul. That's gone. No conscience, no remorse . . . it's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done, and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being since that day.
BUFFY	So you start with my mom? Am I supposed to feel honored?
ANGEL	I didn't bite her.
BUFFY	Then why didn't you say something --
ANGEL	But I wanted to. I can walk like a man but I'm not one. I wanted to kill you tonight.
WILLOW	We're near the Bronze, what now?
GILES	Keep looking for her.
XANDER	Okay, here's a question. Say we find her. Say she's fighting Angel or some of his friends. What the heck are we going to do about it ?
GILES	We have to stop her before it's too late.
XANDER	You couldn't just give her a cell phone for Christmas, could you.
DARLA	Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?
BUFFY	Bad hair on top of that outfit?
BUFFY	So you guys were . . . involved.
DARLA	For several generations.
BUFFY	Well you're going to pile up a few ex's when you've been around since Columbus. You are older than him, right? One gal to another, you look a little worn around the eyes.
DARLA	You're sick and you'll always be sick and you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die. You don't think I came alone do you?
BUFFY	I know I didn't.
BUFFY	Angel!
DARLA	Don't worry, bullets can't kill vampires -- (re: Angel, writhing on the floor) -- they can hurt like hell, but --
COLLIN	Forget her.
MASTER	How dare you! She was my favorite! For four hundred years --
COLLIN	She was weak. We don't need her. I will bring you the Slayer.
MASTER	But to lose her to Angel . . . He was to have sat on my right come the day . . . and now . . .
COLLIN	They're all against you. But soon you'll rise and when you do . . .
BUFFY	Here Mom, you gotta eat this. It's what the doctor said, to build up your iron. How are you feeling?
JOYCE	I'm thinking I should say not so good so you'll continue to wait on me hand and foot but I cannot tell a lie: I feel fine.
BUFFY	Good. I was so worried about you, I mean it actually made me feel sick. If anything happened to you . . .
JOYCE	Now you know how I feel about you every minute of every day.
BUFFY	I guess I do. Ouch, and now I am so sorry for about a kazillion things I've put you through.
BUFFY	Now eat your vegetables.
JOYCE	I did!
BUFFY	Mom . . .
JOYCE	I had two big bites.
XANDER	Ah, the post-fumigation party.
BUFFY	What's the difference between this and the pre-fumigation party?
XANDER	Much heartier cockroaches.
WILLOW	No word from Angel?
BUFFY	No. I don't think he'll be around. It's weird, though. In a way I feel like he's still watching me.
WILLOW	Well, in a way, he is. In the way of that he's right over there.
ANGEL	I just wanted to make sure you're okay, and your mother . . .
BUFFY	We're both good. You?
ANGEL	If I can go a little while without getting shot or stabbed I'll be all right.
ANGEL	Look . . . this can't . . .
BUFFY	I know, ever be anything. For one thing you're like two hundred and twenty-four years older than I am.
ANGEL	I just gotta . . . I gotta walk away from this.
BUFFY	I know. Me, too.
BUFFY	One of us has to go here.
ANGEL	I know.
XANDER	What's going on?
WILLOW	Nothing.
XANDER	Well, as long as they're not kissing . . .
BUFFY	Are you okay?
ANGEL	It's just . . .
BUFFY	Painful, I know . . . I'll see you around.

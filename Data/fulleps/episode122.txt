BUFFY	Giles...
ANYA	Giles?!
WILLOW	I'm in wicked trouble now.
GILES	You've no idea. You have to stop what you're doing.
WILLOW	Ooh, sorry. Can't do that. I'm not finished yet.
GILES	Neither am I. Stay down.
ANYA	How did you--
WILLOW	New trick from the old dog. That's borrowed power. Now way it's strong enough to -
GILES	I'm here to help you.
WILLOW	Thanks, but I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching... Butting in on things that don't concern you...
GILES	You concern me, Willow. Stay on this path and you're going to wind up dead.
BUFFY	Willow. Listen to him. I don't want to fight you anymore.
WILLOW	I don't want to fight you either. I wanna fight him.
GILES	Stay dow--
WILLOW	No.
WILLOW	Asmodea, bring forth--
GILES	Vincire!
WILLOW	What--? No! Off me-- Solvo! Libero--
BUFFY	What did you do?
GILES	Contained her and her powers within a binding field. It puts her in a kind of stasis for the time-- You've cut your hair.
ANYA	I'm blonde!
GILES	Yes. I noticed.
WILLOW	This... won't hold me... forever.
JONATHAN	I can't... run anymore. Need to... breath.
XANDER	You wanna keep breathing, you better keep moving.
ANDREW	This is bogus. We gotta get outta this town. (to Jonathan) Mexico. We should go to Mexico.
XANDER	Hey, you're not going anywhere. We're just gonna hide you two until we get the "all clear" from Buffy.
ANDREW	Yeah? And what if the Slayer's dead already? We're just supposed to sit around waiting for Sabrina to show up and disembowel us?
XANDER	You do what I say--
ANDREW	Don't think so.
DAWN	What are you doing?!
XANDER	Whoa, whoa. Okay, Andy, let's put the sword down.
ANDREW	No way. I'm not gonna die. Not because of something I didn't even do.
XANDER	You're not gonna die.
ANDREW	Oh, yeah? Who's gonna protect me? You?
DAWN	Leave him alone!
JONATHAN	Let him go, Andrew.
ANDREW	You let me go first.
JONATHAN	Uh-uh. Him.
ANDREW	It's your move.
JONATHAN	No, yours.
ANDREW	I'm not budging 'til...
JONATHAN	Xander's right. We're not leaving Sunnydale. And when this is over, you and me are going back to jail and do our time. Right-right?
ANDREW	Fine. (off Jonathan's skeptical look) Right-right, already. Jeez.
XANDER	Like the way I handled that? Letting Jonathan save my neck so he can feel good about himself?
GILES	I came as soon as I heard...
BUFFY	Did the Council--?
GILES	The Council hasn't a clue. About much of anything, really. There's a powerful coven in Devonshire. They sensed the rise of a dangerous magical force here. A dark force, fueled by grief.
BUFFY	Willow.
GILES	I hoped not. Then a seer in the coven told me about Tara... That's when the coven imbued me with their powers -
BUFFY	And sent you to bring Willow down.
GILES	Buffy, what's happened here?
BUFFY	God. I don't know where to start-
GILES	Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the majicks-
BUFFY	She has. She was - and I barely even noticed. Everything's been so... Dawn's a total klepto, Xander left Anya at the altar and Anya became a demon again. And I - I'm so... I've been sleeping with Spike.
ANYA	W-Willow?
ANYA	I know what you're trying to do. Hate to burst your bubble, but mind control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just--
ANYA	Okay.
ANYA	No...
ANYA	I... I don't know how.
GILES	Duct tape?
BUFFY	Over their mouths! Then I'm letting the demon eat them-
GILES	Because they're just figments?
BUFFY	All of it! You, Sunnydale... And I'm a nutcase in L.A.!
GILES	Of course. Why didn't we see it before?
BUFFY	For what?
GILES	I should never have left.
BUFFY	Oh, Giles... You were right to leave. We're just... stupid.
GILES	But I know you're all stupid. I shouldn't have abandoned you.
BUFFY	No. You were right about everything. It is time I was an adult.
GILES	Sometimes the most adult thing you can do is ask for help when you need it.
BUFFY	Now you tell me.
GILES	Buffy, you have a calling -
BUFFY	It was my time, Giles. Someone would have taken my place. So why?
GILES	The coven is working on a way to extract her powers without killing her. And should she survive, you ought to know... There's no guarantee she'll be... as she was.
WILLOW	Willow doesn't live here anymore.
BUFFY	Help.
GILES	Vincire!
WILLOW	Solutum.
GILES	Willow...
WILLOW	Shame on you.
GILES	Tego!
BUFFY	Giles! You're gonna kill her!
DAWN	Where are we going?
XANDER	I have no idea.
DAWN	What?
XANDER	I don't know, okay? I can't even run away well. And that's something I'm usually good at.
DAWN	Then maybe we should we go back and help.
XANDER	Oh, yeah. 'Cause I've been such a big help already. Standing around like a monkey while Buffy gets shot. Tara gets killed... And Willow... Losing her...
DAWN	Well, feeling sorry for yourself isn't helping either, Xander. Y'know if Spike was here, he'd go back and fight.
XANDER	Sure, if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister.
DAWN	What?
XANDER	Forget it.
DAWN	I don't believe you.
XANDER	Fine.
DAWN	He wouldn't do that.
XANDER	Is this blind spot a genetic trait with you Summers women? The only useful thing that animal ever did was finally leave town.
SPIKE	Right then. That was a bloody doddle and a piece o'piss...
WILLOW	That all you got, Jeeves?
GILES	Your powers... may be significantly greater... But I can still hurt you. If I have to.
WILLOW	Hurt me? Boy, you just don't get it, do you? Nothing can hurt me anymore. This...?
GILES	I see. You lose someone you love and the other people in your life... The ones who cares about you become meaningless.
WILLOW	You can ask her yourself.
BUFFY	Don't.
WILLOW	Unless... Somebody, somehow... Can get there in time to save them. Huh. Oh, well...
GILES	Go. And she does. Sprinting for the door.
WILLOW	Good luck.
I	finally have you all to myself...
WILLOW	you're such a hypocrite. Waltzing back here with borrowed magicks... So you can tell me, what...? Magic is bad? Behave? Be a good girl? I don't think you're in any position to tell me what to do.
GILES	Willow...
WILLOW	You were jealous. Still are. Just... couldn't bear that I was the one with power. That's why you ran. That's why you--
GILES	Incurso!
WILLOW	That... was... rude. Now I forgot what I was saying.
GILES	Perhaps... you're not as strong... as you think you are.
WILLOW	Blah blah blah.
GILES	Willow. You need... to stop.
WILLOW	What I need...
I	can feel...
GILES	Willow... It doesn't... have to... be that way. You... you can... stop it.
WILLOW	Yeah. I can. I have to stop this. I'll make it all go away.
GILES	No...
WILLOW	And I know just the place to make it happen.
GILES	No.
JONATHAN	Ow! Son-of-a-bitch!
ANDREW	Buttwipe!
JONATHAN	I wasn't talking to you.
ANDREW	Oh. Reflex.
XANDER	Man, they've really tightened up security around here. One too many squatters from the Hellmouth.
ANDREW	Hide out in the cemetery. What a fantastic idea.
XANDER	Yeah I'm working on a whole shut the hell up pitch I think you'll like too.
DAWN	Xander...?
XANDER	I've had just about as much as I can stand baby-sitting a coupla social retards who don't appreciate--
DAWN	Xander!
XANDER	What?
DAWN	What is that?
BUFFY	Move!
JONATHAN	Mexico, huh?
ANYA	Giles...
GILES	Anya...
ANYA	Giles, I'm sorry. She forced me to free her with her brain. Are you--
GILES	I can see...
ANYA	Oh. It's... a miracle.
GILES	Willow... I can see her... She took the magic I had and now... I know where she is... I can feel what her... (with dread) Oh, God...
ANYA	Giles, you... you have to rest.
GILES	Silly girl. I'm dying.
ANYA	No, you're not.
GILES	It was... It was the only way. I thought there'd be a chance now, but... I know where Willow's gone... She's going to finish it...
ANYA	Finish what?
GILES	The world.
DAWN	Buffy!
BUFFY	We have to get out of here. Xander!
DAWN	I think I saw him hit his head.
BUFFY	We can... pile up some of these... coffins. Give us some height to... Uhh!
DAWN	Maybe one of the tunnels Spike uses is around here. If we could get to his place--
BUFFY	That's the last place we need to be.
DAWN	Oh, but it was good enough for you to take me there after what he did to you.
BUFFY	What he--?
DAWN	Tried to do. Whatever.
BUFFY	Xander...
DAWN	So it's true?
BUFFY	Dawn, we're in big trouble. Now's not the time to--
DAWN	Why didn't you tell me?
BUFFY	You didn't need to know.
DAWN	Yes, I do! I need to know! I'm not a kid anymore...
BUFFY	I'm trying to protect you.
DAWN	Well, you can't! Look around, Buffy. We're trapped in here! Willow's killing and people I love keep dying and you cannot protect me from that !
BUFFY	Dawn...
BUFFY	XANDER?
XANDER	Buffy, you know? Where's Dawn?
DAWN	Here.
BUFFY	Jonathan and Andrew up there with you?
XANDER	Naw. They musta skedaddled while I was out. Weasels. Whoa--
BUFFY	Xander, try to find a rope or something and get us out of here.
XANDER	Right. Okay. I'll... take a look around.
BUFFY	And hurry before--
ANYA	Holy frijole!
BUFFY	Anya! What are you doing here? Where's Giles?
ANYA	He's... still at the magic shop.
DAWN	Giles? Giles is here ? You didn't tell me that.
BUFFY	Did he stop Willow?
ANYA	No. And things just got a whole lot worse.
BUFFY	How worse?
ANYA	End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
DAWN	She... She can do that?
ANYA	She can and she will when she gets to where she's going.
BUFFY	Where's that?
ANYA	Big old Satanic temple. On Kingman's Bluff.
BUFFY	There's no temple on Kingman's Bluff.
BUFFY	Who's she?
ANYA	Way up there in the hierarchy of she- demons. Her followers intended to user her effigy to destroy the world. They all died when the temple got swallowed up in the earthquake of '32.
BUFFY	So, seventy years later, Willow's going to make their dreams come true.
ANYA	She's going to drain the planet's life force, funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and burn the Earth to a cinder.
BUFFY	Not if I can help it.
ANYA	You can't.
BUFFY	What does that mean?
ANYA	I don't know. He said "the Slayer can't stop her." Then he said a bunch of other stuff... he wasn't too... clear. I should hurry and get back to him. He's... alone.
BUFFY	What do you-- Is he okay?
ANYA	I... I don't think he has a lot of time.
BUFFY	Xander? Where's that rope?
DAWN	Buffy...
BUFFY	Xander! Where is he?
DAWN	You heard what Anya said... What Giles said...
BUFFY	I heard. And I don't care... I have to try...
WILLOW	(Latin, phonetic) Day FOH-veh-a oom-BRA-room ob-lee-TAH-rum, ex-ki-TAH- reh, SO-ror TEH-neh-brai, ex-ki-TAH-reh et-- BUFFY I'm not just gonna sit here while Willow incinerates what I'm chosen to protect. I have to stop her...
WILLOW	Always the Slayer...
BUFFY	Willow?
WILLOW	And it is the last, you know... For all your fighting... Thinking you're saving the world...
DAWN	Buf--
BUFFY	By killing us?
WILLOW	It's the only way to stop the pain. I... I can't take it anymore...
BUFFY	Willow - what do you-
WILLOW	It was me that took you out of the Earth. Well, now...
DAWN	Buffy!
BUFFY	I can't take them. They just keep coming.
DAWN	I got your back.
WILLOW	(Latin, phonetic) Proserpexa... IG-nayss poor- GAHNT-ayss day pro-FOON- deess ab-SOO-mant AH-nee- mahss pah-ti-EN-tayss... dul-KEM-kwe MOR-tem FER-ant.
WILLOW	Proserpexa... Let the cleansing fires from the depths burn away the suffering souls... And bring sweet death.
XANDER	Hey, black-eyed girl...
WILLOW	Get out of here.
XANDER	You're not the only one with powers, you know. You may be a hopped up uber-witch, but this carpenter can dry-wall you into the next century.
WILLOW	I'm not joking, Xander. Get out of my way. Now.
GILES	There.
ANYA	What?
GILES	It's not over.
BUFFY	Willow...
DAWN	What? You think I never watched you?
WILLOW	You can't stop this.
XANDER	Yeah, I get that. It's just - where else am I going to go? You've been my best friend my whole life. World gonna end - where else would I want to be?
WILLOW	Is this the master plan? You're going to stop me by telling me you love me?
XANDER	Well, I was going to walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but it seemed kinda cartoony.
WILLOW	Still making jokes.
XANDER	I'm not joking. I know you're in pain. I can't imagine the pain you're in. I know you're about to do something apocalyptically evil and stupid and hey, still want to hang. You're Willow.
WILLOW	Don't call me th-
XANDER	First day of kindergarten you cried 'cause you broke the yellow crayon and you were too afraid to tell anyone. You've come pretty far, ending the world, not a terrific notion but the thing is, yeah. I love you. I loved crayon-breaky Willow and I love scary veiny Willow. So if I'm going out, it's here. You wanna kill the world you start with me. I've earned that.
WILLOW	You think I won't?
XANDER	It doesn't matter. I'll still love you.
WILLOW	Shut up.
XANDER	I love you.
WILLOW	Shut up.
XANDER	I love you, Willow.
WILLOW	Stop...
XANDER	I love you.
DAWN	What happened?
ANYA	Giles? You're not dead.
GILES	No...
ANYA	Why aren't you dead? Why aren't I dead?
GILES	The threat's gone. Willow's been stopped.
ANYA	You mean she's--?
GILES	She's alive. The magic she took from me, it did what I hoped it would...
ANYA	You dosed her. You knew she was going to take your powers all along.
GILES	W-well, I knew there was a possibility. The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of Magic. Which comes, in all it's purity, from the Earth itself. Willow's magic came from a place of rage and power.
ANYA	Oh, and vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
GILES	How... could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into the spark of humanity she had left. Allowed her to feel again... Giving Xander the opportunity to reach her.
ANYA	Xander?
GILES	Yes. It was he that got to her in time. (looking at her) He saved us all.
DAWN	I... I think it's over, Buffy. The world's still here.
BUFFY	Yeah, dummy... You think I wanted the world to end?
DAWN	I don't know... Didn't you?
BUFFY	Dawn, I'm so sorry...
DAWN	It's okay, Buffy... It's okay...
BUFFY	No. It hasn't been. It hasn't been okay...
DAWN	See what?
BUFFY	You. Things have sucked lately, but it's all gonna change - and I want to be there when it does. I want to see my friends happy again. And I want to see you grow up. The woman you're going to become... Because she's going to be beautiful.
VOICE	You have endured the required trials.
SPIKE	Bloody right I have.
VOICE	Very well.
WILLOW	I'm in wicked trouble now.
GILES	You've no idea. You have to stop what you're doing.
WILLOW	Ooh, sorry. Can't do that. I'm not finished yet.

You wanna kill the world you start with me. I've earned that.
WILLOW	You think I won't?
XANDER	It doesn't matter. I'll still love you.
WILLOW	Shut up.
XANDER	I love you, Willow.
WILLOW	Stop...
ANYA	Why aren't you dead? Why aren't I dead?
GILES	The threat's gone. Willow's been stopped.
ANYA	You mean she's--?
GILES	She's alive. The magic she took from me, it did what I hoped it would...
ANYA	You dosed her. You knew she was going to take your powers all along.
GILES	W-well, I knew there was a possibility. The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of Magic. Which comes, in all it's purity, from the Earth itself. Willow's magic came from a place of rage and power.
ANYA	Oh, and vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
GILES	How... could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into the spark of humanity she had left. Allowed her to feel again... Giving Xander the opportunity to reach her.
ANYA	Xander?
GILES	Yes. It was he that got to her in time. (looking at her) He saved us all.
BUFFY	Yeah, dummy... You think I wanted the world to end?
DAWN	I don't know... Didn't you?
DAWN	It's okay, Buffy... It's okay...
BUFFY	No. It hasn't been. It hasn't been okay...
VOICE	You have endured the required trials.
SPIKE	Bloody right I have.
VOICE	Very well.

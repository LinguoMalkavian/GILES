ANGEL	Well, I guess that qualifies as "happy to see me."
BUFFY	Angel, what are you doing -- no. Don't even. I just wanna bask.
ANGEL	Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.
BUFFY	You know me. Not big with the damsel- ing.
ANGEL	Got your share of distress, though.
BUFFY	And then some. You heard?
ANGEL	I got coverage on the whole thing. Very gripping, needs a third act.
BUFFY	You have to leave L.A.
ANGEL	It's the First. Right? The First Evil, The power that tried to convince me to kill myself.
BUFFY	Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army.
ANGEL	Well it failed once, and I'm here to tell you that --
CALEB	You ready to finish this, bitch?
BUFFY	Okay, how many times do I have to kill you? Ballpark figure.
CALEB	You understand nothing.
I	am everything. Everywhere.
BUFFY	Speech gettin' old
CALEB	Stupid girl. You'll never stop me. You don't have the b --
BUFFY	Well, who does nowadays?
ANGEL	Okay, now I'm pissed. Where is he?
BUFFY	He had to split.
I	haven't had a good pun in a while.
ANGEL	That would still be the case.
BUFFY	Hey! My kill, my wordplay.
ANGEL	I'm out of line.
BUFFY	Well, I'm still glad you're here.
FIRST	Yeah, she needs you real bad.
BUFFY	I'll have the guys run through this, see if there's anything new. Reliable source?
ANGEL	Not remotely.
BUFFY	Well, any port in an apocalypse...
ANGEL	I brought something else as well.
BUFFY	I can already tell you, I don't have anything that goes with this.
ANGEL	It's not for you.
BUFFY	Splainy?
ANGEL	I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. Has a purifying power... or a cleansing power - or possibly scrubbing bubbles, the translation is... anyway it bestows strength, worn by the right person.
BUFFY	And the right person is...
ANGEL	Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me.
BUFFY	Or me.
ANGEL	No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, you've already got that cool axe-thing.
BUFFY	So you're gonna be with me in this.
ANGEL	Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours.
BUFFY	No.
ANGEL	No, what?
BUFFY	No, you're not gonna be in this fight.
ANGEL	Why the hell not?
BUFFY	'Cause I can't risk you.
ANGEL	You need me in this.
BUFFY	No, I need you gone.
ANGEL	Why?
BUFFY	If I lose... if this gets past Sunnydale, then it's days -- or hours -- before the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it.
ANGEL	If I'm here we have a better shot at capping this thing. I've read the files --
BUFFY	Well I've lived the files and I... if I can't win this... it's my fight, Angel. It might be my last. But it's mine.
ANGEL	Okay. That's one reason. What's the other?
BUFFY	There is no other.
ANGEL	Is it Spike?
BUFFY	You vampires... did anybody ever tell you that the whole smelling everybody thing is a little gross?
ANGEL	Is he your boyfriend?
BUFFY	Is that your business?
ANGEL	Are you in love with him?
BUFFY	It's different. He's different. He has a soul now.
ANGEL	Oh. Well.
BUFFY	What.
ANGEL	No, no, that's great. Everyone's got a soul now.
BUFFY	What are you, pissed?
ANGEL	No, it's great. One for our side.
BUFFY	He'll make a difference.
ANGEL	You know, I started it. (right to her) The whole... having a soul. Before it was all the "cool new thing"...
BUFFY	Oh my god, are you twelve?
ANGEL	I'm gettin' the brush off for Captain Peroxide, it doesn't bring out the champion in me.
BUFFY	It's not the brush off. Having both of you here would be... confusing.
ANGEL	For who?
BUFFY	Everybody! Why are you so -- Are you gonna come by and get all Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?
ANGEL	Aha! Boyfriend!
BUFFY	He's not! But... He is in my heart.
ANGEL	That'll end well.
BUFFY	And what was the highlight of our relationship? The time you broke up with me or the time I killed you?
ANGEL	Because you're the Slayer?
BUFFY	Because... okay, I'm cookie dough, okay?
ANGEL	Yet another curveball...
BUFFY	I'm not done baking yet. I'm not finished becoming... whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I've been looking for someone to make me feel whole, and maybe I just need to be whole. I make it through this, and the next thing, and the next... maybe one day I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then if I want someone to eat m -- or, to enjoy warm delicious cookie- me, then that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.
ANGEL	Any thoughts on who might enjoy... do I have to go with the cookie analogy?
BUFFY	I don't really think that far ahead. That's kind of the point.
ANGEL	I get it.
BUFFY	Angel. I do. Sometimes... think that far ahead.
ANGEL	Sometimes is something.
BUFFY	It'd be a long time coming. Years, if ever.
ANGEL	I ain't gettin' any older.
BUFFY	Ow...
DAWN	Dumbass.
XANDER	Don't look at me, this is a Summers' thing. It's all very violent.
BUFFY	You get killed, I'm telling.
WILLOW	Did you find out anything about the scythe?
BUFFY	I found out it slices, dices and makes julienne Preacher.
GILES	Caleb?
BUFFY	I cut him in half. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty neat.
WILLOW	Well all right!
ANYA	He had that coming.
XANDER	Party in my eye-socket and everyone's invited! Sometimes I shouldn't say words.
BUFFY	I did find out some history on this puppy. I'll fill you in -- And I got some... (hands over files) ...files, might be helpful, and This. Supposed to be powerful, don't know much more.
GILES	Where'd you get all this?
BUFFY	Angel.
DAWN	Angel?
GILES	He's here.
BUFFY	I sent him back to L.A. To prepare.
XANDER	Operative word "If."
ANYA	Operative word "Fail."
DAWN	Or, operative word "Wheeee!" Nobody gets me.
SPIKE	So where's Tall, Dark and Forehead?
BUFFY	Let me guess. You can smell him.
SPIKE	Yeah, that and I also used my heightened vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.
BUFFY	It was a... hello. I was surprised. SPIKE Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or, I guess they do, but --
BUFFY	There was no tongues. Besides, he's gone.
SPIKE	Just popped round for a quickie, then?
BUFFY	Good, good, I haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap.
SPIKE	He wears lifts, you know.
BUFFY	One of these days, I'm just gonna put you two in a room and let you rassle it out.
SPIKE	No problem at this end.
BUFFY	There could maybe be oil of some kind involved...
SPIKE	Where's the trinket?
BUFFY	The who-ket?
SPIKE	The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power. I believe it's mine now.
BUFFY	How do you figure?
SPIKE	Someone with a soul, but more than human... Angel meant to wear it, that means I'm the qualified party.
BUFFY	It's volatile. We don't know...
SPIKE	You need someone strong to bear it then. You were planning on giving it to Andrew?
BUFFY	Angel said... this amulet is meant to be worn by a champion.
SPIKE	Been called a lot of things in my time...
BUFFY	I want you to be careful.
SPIKE	You're talking to the wrong guy, love. This is powerful.
BUFFY	Faith's still got my room.
SPIKE	Well you're not staying here! Can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk -- you've got Angel breath.
BUFFY	I understand.
SPIKE	Clearly you don't, since that whole "having my pride" thing was a smokescreen.
BUFFY	Oh thank god.
SPIKE	I don't know what I would have done if you'd gone up those stairs.
BUFFY	Let's not find out.
FIRST	Pretty, ain't it?
BUFFY	You're not him.
FIRST	No, you killed him right and proper. Terrible loss. This man was my good right arm. 'Course, it doesn't pain me too much. Don't need an arm. Got an army.
BUFFY	An army of vampires. However will I fight a bunch of -- oh right, I've been doing that for years!
FIRST	Every day our numbers swell. But then, you do have an army of your own. Some thirty-odd pimply-faced girls don't know the pointy end of a stake, maybe I should call this off!
BUFFY	Have you ever considered a cool name? Since you're incorporeal and basically powerless you could call yourself "The Taunter." Strikes fear...
FIRST	I will overrun this earth.
BUFFY	You know how many people have said that to me?
FIRST	I do, since they all had a small part of me in them. Whereas I have all of me in me, so I like my chances somewhat better. And when my army outnumbers the humans on this earth the scales will tip and I will be made flesh.
BUFFY	Talk on. I'm not afraid of you.
FIRST	Then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms?
FIRST	'Cause he can't help you. Nor Faith, nor your friends... certainly not your little wannaslay brigade. None of those girlies will ever know real power unless you're dead. You know the drill:
FIRST	Into every generation, a Slayer is born. One girl in all the world. She alone will have the strength and skill to fight the... well there's that word again. What you are. How you'll die. Alone.
BUFFY	You're right.
FIRST	Mmm. Not your best.
SPIKE	I'm drowning in footwear!
BUFFY	No. Yes. I just realized something. Something that really never occurred to me before.
BUFFY	Well? What do you think?
XANDER	That depends. Are you kidding?
BUFFY	You don't think it's a good idea?
FAITH	It's pretty radical, B.
GILES	It's a lot more than that. Buffy what you're talking about flies in the face of everything we've ever -- that every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it's bloody brilliant.
BUFFY	You mean that?
GILES	If you want my opinion.
BUFFY	I really do.
WILLOW	Whoa hey, not to poop on the party, but I'm the guy who's gonna have to pull this off.
FAITH	It is beaucoup d'mojo...
GILES	I believe it is, if what Buffy has told us about this weapon is true.
WILLOW	Not to careen back to the me subject, but... I'm... this is beyond anything I've ever done. This is a total loss of control, and not in a nice, wholesome, my-girl-friend-has-a- pierced-tongue way.
BUFFY	I wouldn't ask if I didn't think you could do it.
WILLOW	I'm just not sure I'm stable enough to --
ANYA	Oh, sure y'are. You're as stable as the molecules in Mister Fantastic's uniform, am I right?
XANDER	Oh, you just couldn't have picked a worse example.
GILES	You're going to do this, Willow. Get the coven on the line, see how they can help. I'll --
DAWN	Oh! "pierced tongue"
BUFFY	Dawn should do a research thing.
GILES	Yes, you --
DAWN	It's cool. Watcher Junior to the library. (as she goes, to Buffy) You get to save the world, I get more homework.
BUFFY	You could have been in Oxnard...
GILES	I'll start digging up my sources. Literally, actually; there's one or two people I need to talk to who are dead.
ANYA	Come on. Let's go assemble the cannon fodder.
XANDER	We're not calling them that, sweetie.
ANYA	Not to their faces -- what am I, insensitive?
BUFFY	Willow...
WILLOW	I'm gonna need to run an energy scan on that puppy. To start with.
FAITH	Sure you're ready to give it up?
BUFFY	I hate being here. I hate that you have to be here. I hate that there's evil, that it's growing, and I hate that I was chosen to fight it. I wish, a whole lot of the time, that I hadn't been. I know a lot of you wish I hadn't been either.
I	was chosen. And I accept that. I'm not asking you to accept anything. I'm asking you to make your own choice. I believe we can beat this evil -- not when it comes, not after its army is ready, but now. Tomorrow morning I'm opening the Seal. I'm going down into the Hellmouth and I'm going to finish it once and for all.
WOOD	It's a hell of a risky idea.
FAITH	Buffy's wacky that way.
WOOD	There's one more vent right by the stairs. (they head for it) We block that, they got no sewer access, should drive them up into the school proper.
FAITH	That's assuming they get past us.
WOOD	Which, no offense, I am.
FAITH	Come on, you gotta have a little faith.
WOOD	Think I've had my share, thanks.
FAITH	Well I trundled right into that, didn't I. Look, I'm sorry if it seemed like I was blowing you off the other day. I was just trying to, you know... blow you off.
WOOD	I figured that out all by myself.
FAITH	It's nothing personal, it's just... after I get bouncy with a guy, there's not a whole lot more I need to know about him.
WOOD	That's bleak.
FAITH	Way of the world.
WOOD	Good to know. For a second there, I was mistaking it for more defensive, isolationist Slayer crap.
FAITH	And he comes out swingin'...
WOOD	There is a whole world you don't even know about, and a lot of the men in it are pretty decent guys. They'd surprise you.
FAITH	Guy looks at me, let's just say his priorities shift.
WOOD	'Cause you're so hot?
FAITH	Is what it is, yo.
WOOD	Please. I'm much prettier than you.
FAITH	You're tripping! That was rock 'em sock 'em!
WOOD	Oh, it was nice enough... you're very... enthused... with a little more experience I think you'll really...
FAITH	Dude, I got mad skills!
WOOD	No, of course. Let's finish up.
FAITH	Hell with that. We're going again! You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.
WOOD	Faith. Make me a deal. We live through this, you give me the chance to surprise you.
FAITH	Well, what would be the surprise?
WOOD	You do know the meaning of the word, right?
FAITH	Fine. Deal.
WOOD	Good enough.
FAITH	No way are you prettier than me.
WOOD	Little bit.
WILLOW	I really wish she hadn't said that about me.
KENNEDY	What, the thing Buffy said? I think it's true.
WILLOW	Ehheh.
KENNEDY	I'll be with you. To keep you grounded.
WILLOW	You may have to keep me stabbed... if I go to the bad place.
KENNEDY	You're saying I might have to kill you.
WILLOW	I am.
KENNEDY	Bite me.
WILLOW	I will. I mean, I do. Mean it. If I go south, you gotta protect the others.
KENNEDY	It's not gonna happen.
WILLOW	The darkest place I've ever been -- this is what lies beyond that. This is too important for me to...
KENNEDY	Buffy believes in you.
WILLOW	You know, Buffy: Sweet girl, not that bright.
KENNEDY	Hey, I'm the first to call her out when she's not making sense... in fact this may have escaped your keen notice, but I'm kind of a brat. I've sort of always gotten my way. So you're gonna make it through this, no matter how dark it gets. Because now... you're my way.
WILLOW	I better go over it again.
GILES	I've gotten turned around. You're here.
XANDER	By the pillar, yeah. I'm protecting this area.
GILES	That puts me here. By the door. Demons around the perimeter... right. So I open the door.
ANDREW	You go through the door... you are confronted by Trogdor the Burninator.
GILES	Bugger all. Fight.
ANDREW	Adios to five hit points. Trogdor has badly wounded you.
GILES	What about my bag of illusions?
ANDREW	Illusions? Against a burninator? Silly, silly British man.
AMANDA	I invoke a time flux on Trogdor.
ANDREW	Step down, girlfriend, you can't just --
AMANDA	Ninth level sorcerer, and I carry the emerald chalice. Trogdor is frozen in time, deal with it.
XANDER	Smackdown on red riding hood! This could get ugly.
GILES	Could it possibly get uglier? I used to be a highly respected Watcher. Now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily. I wish I could just sleep.
AMANDA	What kind of person could sleep on a night like this?
XANDER	Only the crazy ones.
DAWN	And the Master grabbed Buffy from behind and bit her, she tried to move but he was too strong, he fed on her blood and he tossed her in the water, cackling insanely as the bubbles rose around her and she slowly drowned to death.
VI	Do you have any other stories?
DAWN	She gets up again, it's very romantic. Guys, you gotta stop worrying. It's Buffy. She always saves the day.
WOOD	Welcome to Sunnydale High. There's no running in the halls, no yelling and no gum. Apart from that we have only one rule. If they move, kill 'em.
BUFFY	Potentials are in the basement, follow Faith and Spike.
XANDER	If you have to go to the bathroom, it's on the left. If you don't have to go to the bathroom, picture what you're about to face. Better to go NOW.
WOOD	Willow, my office is through there.
BUFFY	It's right over the Seal.
KENNEDY	I'll start getting you set up.
WILLOW	Thanks.
WOOD	Okay, civilians. The vampires get upstairs we have three areas they could get through to another building and down into the sewers.
GILES	Teams of two then, and I suggest you and I take the lounge.
WOOD	I concur.
BUFFY	Xander, I want you with Dawn.
XANDER	I concur.
DAWN	We'll take the atrium.
ANYA	So that leaves me and the dungeon master in the north hall.
ANDREW	We will defend it with our very lives.
ANYA	Yes, we'll defend it with his very life.
XANDER	Don't be afraid to use him as a human shield.
ANYA	Good, yes, thanks.
ANDREW	And I just wanna say how proud I am to die for this really special cause with you guys. There's some people I'd like to thank, both good and evil... a shout out to my brother Tucker, who gave me the inspiration to summon demons and also --
ANYA	Nobody cares, ya little monkey.
DAWN	I'm gonna check out our field of engagement.
BUFFY	Dawn...
DAWN	No.
BUFFY	So. What do you guys wanna do tomorrow?
WILLOW	Nothing strenuous...
XANDER	Mini-golf is always the first thing that comes to mind.
GILES	Well, I think we can do better than that.
BUFFY	I'm pretty much thinking about shopping. As usual.
WILLOW	There's an Agnes B. in the new mall!
XANDER	I could use a few items.
GILES	Well, no, aren't we gonna discuss this? We're saving the world to go to the mall?
BUFFY	I'm having a wicked shoe craving.
XANDER	Aren't you on the patch?
WILLOW	Those never work.
GILES	And I'm just here, invisible to the eye, not having any vote...
XANDER	See, it's the eye-patch thing.
BUFFY	Right, do you go with the full black secret agent look --
WILLOW	Or the puffy shirt pirate-slash-poet feel. Sensitive yet manly...
BUFFY	It's a fine line.
GILES	The earth is definitely doomed.
SPIKE	Time to go to work, love.
FAITH	You're first, B.
WILLOW	They should be in place. Okay. Magic time. You ready to... heh heh... kill me?
KENNEDY	Starting to be...
WILLOW	Great. Pun. Right. Brace yourself.
KENNEDY	Come on, Red. Make it happen.
SPIKE	Not to be a buzzkill, luv, but my fabulous accessory isn't exactly tingling with power.
BUFFY	I'm not worried.
SPIKE	I'm getting zero juice here. And I look like Elizabeth Taylor.
FAITH	Cheer up, Liz. Willow's big spell doesn't work, won't matter what you wear.
BUFFY	I'm not worried.
RONA	Really? 'Cause I'm flashing back to Xander's whole bathroom speech.
AMANDA	Buffy?
BUFFY	Now Willow Now Willow Now....
AMANDA	Buffy...
BUFFY	I'm not worried! As long as Willow can work the spell before they --
BUFFY	Willow...
KENNEDY	Willow?
WILLOW	Oh...
KENNEDY	NNnnhhhhaahhhh....
BUFFY	So here's the part where you make a choice.
AMANDA	Sweet fancy moses.
FAITH	You feel that?
BUFFY	I really do.
FAITH	Everybody, hold the line...
VI	These guys are dust.
KENNEDY	Oh, this is...
WILLOW	And you're a Slayer.
KENNEDY	Buffy! Catch!
DAWN	You were gonna take me to Oxnard ?
XANDER	I know some people there. You're in my blind spot.
DAWN	Ooh.
ANDREW	I think they're coming...
ANYA	Oh God. I'm terrified. I didn't think... I just figured you would be terrified and I would be sarcastic about it.
ANYA	Bunnies. Floppy, hoppy, bunnies .
SPIKE	Uh, Buffy...?
FAITH	Think it's a little too late to talk this thing out?
BUFFY	Keep the line together! Drive them to the edge, we can't let them --
XANDER	We call that the greenhouse effect. Very dangerous --
FAITH	Buffy?
BUFFY	Hold the line...
FAITH	Rona!
FIRST	Ooh! Ow! Mommy! This mortal wound is all itchy! You pulled a nice trick. Hey, you came pretty close to smacking me down. What more do you want?
BUFFY	I want you... to get out of my face .
SPIKE	Oh, bollocks.
WILLOW	I didn't do that...
SPIKE	Buffy...
BUFFY	Spike!
FAITH	Everybody out! Now!
SPIKE	I can feel it, Buffy.
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	My soul. It's really there. Kinda stings.
WOOD	The bus! Get 'em on the bus!
GILES	Everybody! This way!
XANDER	Anya! ANYA!
ANDREW	Why...
SPIKE	Go on, then...
BUFFY	You've done enough, you can still --
SPIKE	No. You beat 'em back, it's for me to do the clean up.
FAITH	Buffy! Come on!
SPIKE	Gotta move, lamb. I think it's fair to say school's out for the bloody summer.
BUFFY	Spike...
SPIKE	I mean it. I gotta do this.
BUFFY	I love you.
SPIKE	No you don't. But thanks for saying it.
DAWN	Buffy...
VI	Stay awake. Look at me! This is nothing!
ANDREW	Why didn't I die?
FAITH	Ease off. We're clear.
XANDER	Did you see?
ANDREW	I was scared, I'm sorry...
XANDER	Did you see what happened? Was she...
ANDREW	She was incredible. She died saving my life.
XANDER	That's my girl. Always doing the stupid thing.
FAITH	It's not that bad... you just sit here.
WOOD	That's the plan...
FAITH	I'll get someone to --
WOOD	Did we make it?
FAITH	We made it. We won.
WOOD	Surprise.
GILES	I don't understand. What did this?
BUFFY	Spike.
FAITH	Looks like the Hellmouth is officially closed for business.
GILES	There is another one in Cleveland. Not to spoil the moment...
XANDER	We saved the world.
WILLOW	We changed the world. I can feel them, Buffy. All over. There are Slayers awakening everywhere.
DAWN	We'll have to find them.
WILLOW	We will.
GILES	Yes, because the mall was actually in Sunnydale, so no hope of going there tomorrow...
DAWN	We destroyed the Mall? I fought on the wrong side...
XANDER	All those stores gone... The Gap, Starbucks, Toys R Us... who will remember these landmarks unless we tell the world of them?
GILES	We have a lot of work ahead of us...
FAITH	Can I push him in?
WILLOW	You got my vote.
FAITH	I just wanna sleep, yo. For like a week.
DAWN	I guess we all could. If we wanted to.
WILLOW	Yeah, the First is scrunched, so... What do you think we should do, Buffy?
FAITH	Yeah, you're not the one and only chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?
DAWN	Buffy? What are we gonna do now?
ANGEL	Well, I guess that qualifies as "happy to see me."
BUFFY	Angel, what are you doing -- no. Don't even. I just wanna bask.
ANGEL	Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.
BUFFY	You know me. Not big with the damsel- ing.
ANGEL	Got your share of distress, though.
BUFFY	And then some. You heard?
ANGEL	I got coverage on the whole thing. Very gripping, needs a third act.
BUFFY	You have to leave L.A.
ANGEL	It's the First. Right? The First Evil, The power that tried to convince me to kill myself.
BUFFY	Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army.
ANGEL	Well it failed once, and I'm here to tell you that --
BUFFY	Okay, how many times do I have to kill you? Ballpark figure.
CALEB	You understand nothing.
I	am everything. Everywhere.
BUFFY	Speech gettin' old
CALEB	Stupid girl. You'll never stop me. You don't have the b --
I	haven't had a good pun in a while.
ANGEL	That would still be the case.
BUFFY	Hey! My kill, my wordplay.
ANGEL	I'm out of line.
BUFFY	Well, I'm still glad you're here.
BUFFY	I'll have the guys run through this, see if there's anything new. Reliable source?
ANGEL	Not remotely.
BUFFY	Well, any port in an apocalypse...
ANGEL	I brought something else as well.
BUFFY	I can already tell you, I don't have anything that goes with this.
ANGEL	It's not for you.
BUFFY	Splainy?
ANGEL	I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. Has a purifying power... or a cleansing power - or possibly scrubbing bubbles, the translation is... anyway it bestows strength, worn by the right person.
BUFFY	And the right person is...
ANGEL	Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me.
BUFFY	Or me.
ANGEL	No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, you've already got that cool axe-thing.
BUFFY	So you're gonna be with me in this.
ANGEL	Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours.
BUFFY	No.
ANGEL	No, what?
BUFFY	No, you're not gonna be in this fight.
ANGEL	Why the hell not?
BUFFY	'Cause I can't risk you.
ANGEL	You need me in this.
BUFFY	No, I need you gone.
ANGEL	Why?
BUFFY	If I lose... if this gets past Sunnydale, then it's days -- or hours -- before the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it.
ANGEL	If I'm here we have a better shot at capping this thing. I've read the files --
BUFFY	Well I've lived the files and I... if I can't win this... it's my fight, Angel. It might be my last. But it's mine.
ANGEL	Okay. That's one reason. What's the other?
BUFFY	There is no other.
BUFFY	You vampires... did anybody ever tell you that the whole smelling everybody thing is a little gross?
ANGEL	Is he your boyfriend?
BUFFY	Is that your business?
ANGEL	Are you in love with him?
BUFFY	It's different. He's different. He has a soul now.
ANGEL	Oh. Well.
BUFFY	What.
ANGEL	No, no, that's great. Everyone's got a soul now.
BUFFY	What are you, pissed?
ANGEL	No, it's great. One for our side.
BUFFY	He'll make a difference.
ANGEL	You know, I started it. (right to her) The whole... having a soul. Before it was all the "cool new thing"...
BUFFY	Oh my god, are you twelve?
ANGEL	I'm gettin' the brush off for Captain Peroxide, it doesn't bring out the champion in me.
BUFFY	It's not the brush off. Having both of you here would be... confusing.
ANGEL	For who?
BUFFY	Everybody! Why are you so -- Are you gonna come by and get all Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?
ANGEL	Aha! Boyfriend!
BUFFY	He's not! But... He is in my heart.
ANGEL	That'll end well.
BUFFY	And what was the highlight of our relationship? The time you broke up with me or the time I killed you?
ANGEL	Because you're the Slayer?
BUFFY	Because... okay, I'm cookie dough, okay?
ANGEL	Yet another curveball...
BUFFY	I'm not done baking yet. I'm not finished becoming... whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I've been looking for someone to make me feel whole, and maybe I just need to be whole. I make it through this, and the next thing, and the next... maybe one day I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then if I want someone to eat m -- or, to enjoy warm delicious cookie- me, then that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.
ANGEL	Any thoughts on who might enjoy... do I have to go with the cookie analogy?
BUFFY	I don't really think that far ahead. That's kind of the point.
ANGEL	I get it.
ANGEL	Sometimes is something.
BUFFY	It'd be a long time coming. Years, if ever.
BUFFY	Ow...
DAWN	Dumbass.
XANDER	Don't look at me, this is a Summers' thing. It's all very violent.
BUFFY	You get killed, I'm telling.
WILLOW	Did you find out anything about the scythe?
BUFFY	I found out it slices, dices and makes julienne Preacher.
GILES	Caleb?
BUFFY	I cut him in half. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty neat.
WILLOW	Well all right!
ANYA	He had that coming.
XANDER	Party in my eye-socket and everyone's invited! Sometimes I shouldn't say words.
BUFFY	I did find out some history on this puppy. I'll fill you in -- And I got some... (hands over files) ...files, might be helpful, and This. Supposed to be powerful, don't know much more.
GILES	Where'd you get all this?
BUFFY	Angel.
DAWN	Angel?
GILES	He's here.
BUFFY	I sent him back to L.A. To prepare.
XANDER	Operative word "If."
ANYA	Operative word "Fail."
DAWN	Or, operative word "Wheeee!" Nobody gets me.
SPIKE	So where's Tall, Dark and Forehead?
BUFFY	Let me guess. You can smell him.
SPIKE	Yeah, that and I also used my heightened vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.
BUFFY	It was a... hello. I was surprised. SPIKE Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or, I guess they do, but --
BUFFY	There was no tongues. Besides, he's gone.
SPIKE	Just popped round for a quickie, then?
BUFFY	Good, good, I haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap.
SPIKE	He wears lifts, you know.
BUFFY	One of these days, I'm just gonna put you two in a room and let you rassle it out.
SPIKE	No problem at this end.
BUFFY	There could maybe be oil of some kind involved...
SPIKE	Where's the trinket?
BUFFY	The who-ket?
SPIKE	The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power. I believe it's mine now.
BUFFY	How do you figure?
SPIKE	Someone with a soul, but more than human... Angel meant to wear it, that means I'm the qualified party.
BUFFY	It's volatile. We don't know...
SPIKE	You need someone strong to bear it then. You were planning on giving it to Andrew?
BUFFY	Angel said... this amulet is meant to be worn by a champion.
SPIKE	Been called a lot of things in my time...
BUFFY	I want you to be careful.
SPIKE	You're talking to the wrong guy, love. This is powerful.
BUFFY	Faith's still got my room.
SPIKE	Well you're not staying here! Can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk -- you've got Angel breath.
BUFFY	I understand.
SPIKE	Clearly you don't, since that whole "having my pride" thing was a smokescreen.
BUFFY	Oh thank god.
SPIKE	I don't know what I would have done if you'd gone up those stairs.
BUFFY	You're not him.
FIRST	No, you killed him right and proper. Terrible loss. This man was my good right arm. 'Course, it doesn't pain me too much. Don't need an arm. Got an army.
BUFFY	An army of vampires. However will I fight a bunch of -- oh right, I've been doing that for years!
FIRST	Every day our numbers swell. But then, you do have an army of your own. Some thirty-odd pimply-faced girls don't know the pointy end of a stake, maybe I should call this off!
BUFFY	Have you ever considered a cool name? Since you're incorporeal and basically powerless you could call yourself "The Taunter." Strikes fear...
FIRST	I will overrun this earth.
BUFFY	You know how many people have said that to me?
FIRST	I do, since they all had a small part of me in them. Whereas I have all of me in me, so I like my chances somewhat better. And when my army outnumbers the humans on this earth the scales will tip and I will be made flesh.
BUFFY	Talk on. I'm not afraid of you.
FIRST	Then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms?
BUFFY	You're right.
FIRST	Mmm. Not your best.
SPIKE	I'm drowning in footwear!
XANDER	That depends. Are you kidding?
BUFFY	You don't think it's a good idea?
FAITH	It's pretty radical, B.
GILES	It's a lot more than that. Buffy what you're talking about flies in the face of everything we've ever -- that every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it's bloody brilliant.
BUFFY	You mean that?
GILES	If you want my opinion.
BUFFY	I really do.
WILLOW	Whoa hey, not to poop on the party, but I'm the guy who's gonna have to pull this off.
FAITH	It is beaucoup d'mojo...
GILES	I believe it is, if what Buffy has told us about this weapon is true.
WILLOW	Not to careen back to the me subject, but... I'm... this is beyond anything I've ever done. This is a total loss of control, and not in a nice, wholesome, my-girl-friend-has-a- pierced-tongue way.
BUFFY	I wouldn't ask if I didn't think you could do it.
WILLOW	I'm just not sure I'm stable enough to --
ANYA	Oh, sure y'are. You're as stable as the molecules in Mister Fantastic's uniform, am I right?
XANDER	Oh, you just couldn't have picked a worse example.
GILES	You're going to do this, Willow. Get the coven on the line, see how they can help. I'll --
DAWN	Oh! "pierced tongue"
BUFFY	Dawn should do a research thing.
GILES	Yes, you --
DAWN	It's cool. Watcher Junior to the library. (as she goes, to Buffy) You get to save the world, I get more homework.
BUFFY	You could have been in Oxnard...
GILES	I'll start digging up my sources. Literally, actually; there's one or two people I need to talk to who are dead.
ANYA	Come on. Let's go assemble the cannon fodder.
XANDER	We're not calling them that, sweetie.
ANYA	Not to their faces -- what am I, insensitive?
BUFFY	Willow...
WILLOW	I'm gonna need to run an energy scan on that puppy. To start with.
FAITH	Sure you're ready to give it up?
WOOD	It's a hell of a risky idea.
FAITH	Buffy's wacky that way.
WOOD	There's one more vent right by the stairs. (they head for it) We block that, they got no sewer access, should drive them up into the school proper.
FAITH	That's assuming they get past us.
WOOD	Which, no offense, I am.
FAITH	Come on, you gotta have a little faith.
WOOD	Think I've had my share, thanks.
FAITH	Well I trundled right into that, didn't I. Look, I'm sorry if it seemed like I was blowing you off the other day. I was just trying to, you know... blow you off.
WOOD	I figured that out all by myself.
FAITH	It's nothing personal, it's just... after I get bouncy with a guy, there's not a whole lot more I need to know about him.
WOOD	That's bleak.
FAITH	Way of the world.
WOOD	Good to know. For a second there, I was mistaking it for more defensive, isolationist Slayer crap.
FAITH	And he comes out swingin'...
WOOD	There is a whole world you don't even know about, and a lot of the men in it are pretty decent guys. They'd surprise you.
FAITH	Guy looks at me, let's just say his priorities shift.
WOOD	'Cause you're so hot?
FAITH	Is what it is, yo.
WOOD	Please. I'm much prettier than you.
FAITH	You're tripping! That was rock 'em sock 'em!
WOOD	Oh, it was nice enough... you're very... enthused... with a little more experience I think you'll really...
FAITH	Dude, I got mad skills!
WOOD	No, of course. Let's finish up.
FAITH	Hell with that. We're going again! You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.
WOOD	Faith. Make me a deal. We live through this, you give me the chance to surprise you.
FAITH	Well, what would be the surprise?
WOOD	You do know the meaning of the word, right?
FAITH	Fine. Deal.
WOOD	Good enough.
FAITH	No way are you prettier than me.
WOOD	Little bit.
WILLOW	I really wish she hadn't said that about me.
KENNEDY	What, the thing Buffy said? I think it's true.
WILLOW	Ehheh.
KENNEDY	I'll be with you. To keep you grounded.
WILLOW	You may have to keep me stabbed... if I go to the bad place.
KENNEDY	You're saying I might have to kill you.
WILLOW	I am.
KENNEDY	Bite me.
WILLOW	I will. I mean, I do. Mean it. If I go south, you gotta protect the others.
KENNEDY	It's not gonna happen.
WILLOW	The darkest place I've ever been -- this is what lies beyond that. This is too important for me to...
KENNEDY	Buffy believes in you.
WILLOW	You know, Buffy: Sweet girl, not that bright.
KENNEDY	Hey, I'm the first to call her out when she's not making sense... in fact this may have escaped your keen notice, but I'm kind of a brat. I've sort of always gotten my way. So you're gonna make it through this, no matter how dark it gets. Because now... you're my way.
GILES	I've gotten turned around. You're here.
XANDER	By the pillar, yeah. I'm protecting this area.
GILES	That puts me here. By the door. Demons around the perimeter... right. So I open the door.
ANDREW	You go through the door... you are confronted by Trogdor the Burninator.
GILES	Bugger all. Fight.
ANDREW	Adios to five hit points. Trogdor has badly wounded you.
GILES	What about my bag of illusions?
ANDREW	Illusions? Against a burninator? Silly, silly British man.
AMANDA	I invoke a time flux on Trogdor.
ANDREW	Step down, girlfriend, you can't just --
AMANDA	Ninth level sorcerer, and I carry the emerald chalice. Trogdor is frozen in time, deal with it.
XANDER	Smackdown on red riding hood! This could get ugly.
GILES	Could it possibly get uglier? I used to be a highly respected Watcher. Now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily. I wish I could just sleep.
AMANDA	What kind of person could sleep on a night like this?
DAWN	And the Master grabbed Buffy from behind and bit her, she tried to move but he was too strong, he fed on her blood and he tossed her in the water, cackling insanely as the bubbles rose around her and she slowly drowned to death.
VI	Do you have any other stories?
DAWN	She gets up again, it's very romantic. Guys, you gotta stop worrying. It's Buffy. She always saves the day.
WOOD	Welcome to Sunnydale High. There's no running in the halls, no yelling and no gum. Apart from that we have only one rule. If they move, kill 'em.
BUFFY	Potentials are in the basement, follow Faith and Spike.
WOOD	Willow, my office is through there.
BUFFY	It's right over the Seal.
KENNEDY	I'll start getting you set up.
WILLOW	Thanks.
WOOD	Okay, civilians. The vampires get upstairs we have three areas they could get through to another building and down into the sewers.
GILES	Teams of two then, and I suggest you and I take the lounge.
WOOD	I concur.
BUFFY	Xander, I want you with Dawn.
XANDER	I concur.
DAWN	We'll take the atrium.
ANYA	So that leaves me and the dungeon master in the north hall.
ANDREW	We will defend it with our very lives.
ANYA	Yes, we'll defend it with his very life.
XANDER	Don't be afraid to use him as a human shield.
ANYA	Good, yes, thanks.
ANDREW	And I just wanna say how proud I am to die for this really special cause with you guys. There's some people I'd like to thank, both good and evil... a shout out to my brother Tucker, who gave me the inspiration to summon demons and also --
ANYA	Nobody cares, ya little monkey.
BUFFY	Dawn...
DAWN	No.
BUFFY	So. What do you guys wanna do tomorrow?
WILLOW	Nothing strenuous...
XANDER	Mini-golf is always the first thing that comes to mind.
GILES	Well, I think we can do better than that.
BUFFY	I'm pretty much thinking about shopping. As usual.
WILLOW	There's an Agnes B. in the new mall!
XANDER	I could use a few items.
GILES	Well, no, aren't we gonna discuss this? We're saving the world to go to the mall?
BUFFY	I'm having a wicked shoe craving.
XANDER	Aren't you on the patch?
WILLOW	Those never work.
GILES	And I'm just here, invisible to the eye, not having any vote...
XANDER	See, it's the eye-patch thing.
BUFFY	Right, do you go with the full black secret agent look --
WILLOW	Or the puffy shirt pirate-slash-poet feel. Sensitive yet manly...
BUFFY	It's a fine line.
WILLOW	They should be in place. Okay. Magic time. You ready to... heh heh... kill me?
KENNEDY	Starting to be...
WILLOW	Great. Pun. Right. Brace yourself.
SPIKE	Not to be a buzzkill, luv, but my fabulous accessory isn't exactly tingling with power.
BUFFY	I'm not worried.
SPIKE	I'm getting zero juice here. And I look like Elizabeth Taylor.
FAITH	Cheer up, Liz. Willow's big spell doesn't work, won't matter what you wear.
BUFFY	I'm not worried.
RONA	Really? 'Cause I'm flashing back to Xander's whole bathroom speech.
AMANDA	Buffy?
BUFFY	Now Willow Now Willow Now....
AMANDA	Buffy...
BUFFY	I'm not worried! As long as Willow can work the spell before they --
WILLOW	Oh...
FAITH	You feel that?
BUFFY	I really do.
FAITH	Everybody, hold the line...
VI	These guys are dust.
WILLOW	And you're a Slayer.
DAWN	You were gonna take me to Oxnard ?
XANDER	I know some people there. You're in my blind spot.
DAWN	Ooh.
ANDREW	I think they're coming...
ANYA	Oh God. I'm terrified. I didn't think... I just figured you would be terrified and I would be sarcastic about it.
FAITH	Think it's a little too late to talk this thing out?
BUFFY	Keep the line together! Drive them to the edge, we can't let them --
FAITH	Buffy?
BUFFY	Hold the line...
SPIKE	I can feel it, Buffy.
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	My soul. It's really there. Kinda stings.
WOOD	The bus! Get 'em on the bus!
GILES	Everybody! This way!
SPIKE	Go on, then...
BUFFY	You've done enough, you can still --
SPIKE	No. You beat 'em back, it's for me to do the clean up.
BUFFY	Spike...
SPIKE	I mean it. I gotta do this.
XANDER	Did you see?
ANDREW	I was scared, I'm sorry...
XANDER	Did you see what happened? Was she...
FAITH	It's not that bad... you just sit here.
WOOD	That's the plan...
FAITH	I'll get someone to --
WOOD	Did we make it?
GILES	I don't understand. What did this?
BUFFY	Spike.
FAITH	Looks like the Hellmouth is officially closed for business.
GILES	There is another one in Cleveland. Not to spoil the moment...
XANDER	We saved the world.
WILLOW	We changed the world. I can feel them, Buffy. All over. There are Slayers awakening everywhere.
DAWN	We'll have to find them.
WILLOW	We will.
GILES	Yes, because the mall was actually in Sunnydale, so no hope of going there tomorrow...
DAWN	We destroyed the Mall? I fought on the wrong side...
XANDER	All those stores gone... The Gap, Starbucks, Toys R Us... who will remember these landmarks unless we tell the world of them?
GILES	We have a lot of work ahead of us...
FAITH	Can I push him in?
WILLOW	You got my vote.
FAITH	I just wanna sleep, yo. For like a week.
DAWN	I guess we all could. If we wanted to.
WILLOW	Yeah, the First is scrunched, so... What do you think we should do, Buffy?
FAITH	Yeah, you're not the one and only chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?

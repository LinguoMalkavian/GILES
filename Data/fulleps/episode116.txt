WILLOW	(a whisper) Buffy... it's hideous. My god, Buffy, look at its arms!
BUFFY	I know. But it's my duty...
WILLOW	Duty-schmooty. I'm s'posed to be the best man. Shouldn't I be all Marlene Dietrichy in a dashing tuxedo number?
BUFFY	No, cuz that would be totally unfair. We all must participate equally in the cosmic joke of bridesmaids-dom.
WILLOW	Maybe if I ask Anya I can still go with the traditional blood larva and burlap. I mean, she was a vengeance demon for like a thousand years, she'd know all the most flattering... larvae. What was she thinking?
BUFFY	I think Anya's way too stressed to think right now, what with Xander's relatives and her... demons...
WILLOW	Ohmigod, last night. That rehearsal dinner. It was a zoo without the table manners. And I bet it got worse after we left.
BUFFY	I can't believe everyone is buying the story that Anya's people are "circus folk." The thing with the tentacles, what's he s'posed to be, Inky the Squid Boy?
WILLOW	And Xander's family, I haven't seen 'em that bad since my bat mitzvah. Did you see how much they drank?
BUFFY	Kinda. Mr. Harris threw up in my purse.
ANYA	Oh. Oh. You two look so beautiful.
XANDER	So it's all about, um, pain and loss?
CAROL	It can be.
XANDER	Well, then, that's just fine and I gotta go be somewhere else...
CAROL	No, no, no. I'm saying it wrong. I'm not saying you kids shouldn't get hitched. I'm just saying don't build castles on the sand. Cuz that's when life hits you with the big sack of crap and your heart breaks like a china doll.
XANDER	Mmm. Thanks, Carol.
CAROL	Next thing you know, you're trying to find a man'll date a divorcee with a kid. Guess what? No such animal. I hope you don't think you're wearing that.
XANDER	Oh! Karen. How're you? Let's get you breakfast, okay?
RORY	Oh, you don't want those.
DEMON	'Scuse me, folks, coming through!
XANDER	Rory? Whatcha doin' there?
RORY	Trying to make an Irish coffee, stupid thing's on the fritz--
XANDER	Watch out, it's plugged--
RORY	Hah! Gotcha!
DEMON	(re: coffee maker) Is it really broken? I could take a look...
RORY	Knock yourself out, Kevin.
DEMON	Krelvin.
RORY	Right, right. Krelvin.
HARRIS	Damn it, Xander, aren't you ready yet? Should I go move the car?
HARRIS	Oh my, look at my hair. Of course, I'm sure I won't be in any of the pictures.
XANDER	You'll be in the pictures, Mom.
DEMON	(to Mrs. Harris) I think your hair looks lovely.
HARRIS	(re: Warty demon) Aw, Sweet Baby Lord in his high heavenly throne.
XANDER	Hey, who wants breakfast?
HARRIS	I suppose it's okay if I look a little plump, since I won't be--
XANDER	You're in the pictures, Mom!
HARRIS	(re: Warty demon) That's one of hers, right? You're one of hers, right?
XANDER	You met Krelvin already, Dad. Last night.
DEMON	Yes. We met. You said I resembled your mother in law.
HARRIS	Tony!
HARRIS	Oh, yeah.
DEMON	Later, you hit me with a cocktail wiener and insulted my heritage.
HARRIS	Heritage? Being "circus folk" is suddenly heritage now? I mean no disrespect, of course. Sure you come from a long, proud line of geeks. Joking, big guy...
CAROL	Xander? That guy Kevin. If he cleared up that skin problem... Do you... you supose he'd date a woman with a kid? I mean, I can't afford to be picky here...
XANDER	Cousin Carol, your earrings are my cufflinks.
CAROL	They are? Oh my. Oops!
XANDER	Excellent. Cufflinks - check. We're rolling. Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.
WILLOW	There we go...tuck that there and let's see, maybe one little flower here...
DAWN	(re: dress color) Asparagus. Oh. Um, it's sweet. In sort of a macabre, dressing up dead animals in funny costumes way. But sweet.
WILLOW	Yeah.
DAWN	I thought Xander and Anya couldn't afford flowers.
WILLOW	Giles sent 'em. Aren't they gorgeous?
DAWN	Yeah.
WILLOW	Me too. And I'm sure he'd much rather be here than fighting that nasty demon--
DAWN	Da-e-mon. In England it's daemon.
WILLOW	Daemon, too right. But Giles' got responsibilities. And so Anya and Xander have flowers. And flowers. And more flowers. Ooh, it's going to be so pretty!
DAWN	Yeah, except for the amazing girl asparagus.
WILLOW	Oh, Dawnie you look beautiful. Well, okay, but as good as anyone could, considering.
DAWN	It's the color of snot
XANDER	Is it too small?
BUFFY	Nah.
XANDER	It fit when I picked up the tux. How can it not fit now?
BUFFY	It'll fit.
XANDER	Aw man. What if it doesn't? What if I can't wear my cummerbund and the whole world sees the place where my pants meet my shirt? That can't happen Buffy! I must wear das cummerbund!
BUFFY	And... so... you... SHALL.
XANDER	You did it?
BUFFY	Slayer strength.
XANDER	And I've been meaning to cut back on the habit-forming oxygen.
BUFFY	You look really great, Mr. About- to-get-married. You're glowing.
XANDER	Or maybe, I dunno... maybe I'm just happy.
BUFFY	Oh, good teary.
XANDER	Happy teary? Not frustrated with bow tie teary?
BUFFY	Yes. Happy. Happy for you.
I	mean, you and Anya give me hope. It's like you two are proof that there's light at the end of this long, long nasty tunnel. I can't tie this! Hey, isn't your best man supposed to do this?
XANDER	She said she had something important to do.
WILLOW	Want me to hold it shut for you?
TARA	Okay.
ANYA	Are you guys even listening? I need feedback, people!
TARA	Sorry. Please continue with the vows.
ANYA	'I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, and to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are like a sea captain or something? I will however...' What?
TARA	Nope, nothing, Sweetie. Now keep still.
ANYA	Okay. Blah, blah, blah misogynistic. Blah, blah, 'I will however entrust you with my heart...'
TARA	Um, I think we're all set here. Let's take a look at you.
WILLOW	Wow. You look lovely. Really lovely.
ANYA	Thanks. It's probably the blush of imprudent spending. Do you think Xander will like it? Oh! I want to see Xander now!
WILLOW	You can't. It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her dress, 'member?
ANYA	Oh, I can't keep all these ridiculous traditions straight. What if I'm not wearing my dress when I see him? (off their looks) Okay, no sex. Cuddling or...it's just, I'm so excited and I want to share it all with my best friend.
RORY	Look who agreed to be my date for tonight!
CATERER	I'm really supposed to be working. I'm one of the caterers...
RORY	Hush, hush. No woman of mine has to work. All you have to do is sit pretty and laugh when I tell a good one. Tell her what a funny guy I am, Dawnie.
DAWN	Gotta go. Enjoy the wedding.
RORY	Ooh. Bad head.
CATERER	What?
RORY	Lips weren't split right. See, you gotta hold the lip between your finger and thumb, and slice right through the center of the meat...
HOFFRYN	Hymen's greetings!
DAWN	Hy-- What?!
HOFFRYN	Hymen, the God of Matrimony! His Salutations upon you! May the love we celebrate today avoid an almost inevitable decline!
DAWN	Cool.
HOFFRYN	I brought a gift. I suppose there's a table...
DAWN	Oh. Halfrek. Hello.
HALFREK	Please! Call me Hallie, we're practically family now.
DAWN	Mmmmm. Neat.
HOFFRYN	Careful, it's...
DAWN	Fragile?
HOFFRYN	Squirmy.
HALFREK	So, Dawnie. How is everything? Going good? Nothing you wish was different...?
HOFFRYN	Hallie, for Yekk's sake, take a day off. We're not here to do vengeance, we're here to mingle.
DAWN	Spike.
SPIKE	Like you to meet my date.
DAWN	Hi. I'm Dawn.
GIRL	Uh-huh.
SPIKE	So, yeah. Anyway, that's my date. She's with me. My date for the wedding.
DAWN	Yeah. Okay. Well, nice meeting you.
CAROL	So, circus performers. What's that like?
RORY	Your friend with the warts, he went off about his circus 'heritage,' like you folks are in a cult or something.
CLEM	Well, there are ancient ways. Clowning, as an occupation, grew out of the commedia del'arte, and ancient sports of course...
RORY	The thing is, if you expect Xander to raise his kids in some kinda foreign-talkee bow-to-the-eastee kinda cult--
DEMON	So you think the children should be raised in ignorance of our ways?
CAROL	No, no. The Harrises are very broad-minded. We're Episcopalians.
HARRIS	'Til death do us part. That's what makes me laugh.
BARTENDER	I'm really not supposed to start serving until after the ceremony.
HARRIS	I paid for this wedding. I paid for that bourbon there and I paid for this glass here. And I paid for you, cater-waiter.
XANDER	How do I look?
BUFFY	Let's see. We found your shoes and your fly is zipped up. I'd say you're ready to get married. You're one of the decent ones, Xander. I hope I get as lucky as you guys someday.
XANDER	You want to get lucky? I've still got what? Fifteen, twenty minutes?
BUFFY	Alright, into the breach with you.
XANDER	Okay, breach me.
BUFFY	Don't let your dad near the bar.
XANDER	Check. Number two?
BUFFY	Don't let your mom near the bar.
DAWN	Hey Buffy. Spike's here and he brought a total skank.
BUFFY	A--
DAWN	Skank! A manic-panicked freak who he's like totally macking with, right in the middle of the room. I saw him shove his tongue--
BUFFY	Wait, Spike brought a date?
DAWN	Yeah. Wait till you see her.
XANDER	Guys, I better go meet and greet.
BUFFY	Oh yeah, go. I'll just be a sec.
HARRIS	Alexander, do you realize that the usher sat us in the third row?
XANDER	Mom, I'm sure it was a mistake-
MAN	Excuse me?
RORY	(to Xander) Say Neph, have you seen the photographer? I've got a... proposition for him--
MAN	I really need a word with you--
DAWN	Xander!
XANDER	Got loose?
DAWN	Yeah, it's a fully live squiggily thingy and why is Halfrek a bridesmaid?
HARRIS	Now Anya decided not to have us in the processional and that's fine, but the third row-
MAN	Please. You have to listen to me!
XANDER	Hey...
MAN	Don't get married today. It's a huge mistake-
XANDER	Yeah right, well thanks for the advice, Uncle...help me here.
MAN	Uncle - ? No... You don't recognize me, do you? But why would you? Time hasn't been kind to us, has it?
XANDER	(gentle; apologetic) I'm sorry. I don't-
MAN	It sounds crazy, I know, but you have to believe me- I'm Xander Harris. I'm you.
XANDER	What do you mean, 'You're me'?
MAN	I'm you. I'm you from the future.
XANDER	0h, from the future ! For a minute I thought you were a nutball but now that-
MAN	(more desperate) Please. Listen to me. I found a way back so I could warn you. To tell you-
XANDER	Hey, hey. Take it easy. Everything is going to be okay. I swear I told that kid not to serve drinks before the ceremony.
HARRIS	A toast! A toast!
DEMON	But they're not even married yet. You can't make a--
HARRIS	I paid for this wedding and I can make a toast if I want to.
MAN	I thought you might need convincing. Come on. Follow me.
HARRIS	...and to my lovely wife, Jessica. Where are you, honey?
CLEM	Does this jerk ever shut up?
DEMON	He's making my suckers twitch.
HARRIS	And now a toast in honor of the bride's dermatologically- challenged family shrub--
DEMON	Sit down!
HARRIS	Hey -- HEY! I paid for all of this! You want me to sit down, cough up a couple grand, Squidly!
DEMON	What'd you call me, you drunk piece of--
BUFFY	Mazaltov!
HARRIS	Hey, what's this?
BUFFY	You must be so happy for Xander on his special, once-in-a-lifetime day, Mr. Harris.
HARRIS	Nice chassis. What's under the hood?
BUFFY	I could really go for a strong cup of coffee. Hey, let's get you one too.
HARRIS	Say... do you own a sorta square, pinkish purse?
BUFFY	I did.
HARRIS	Thought so. How about we slip into the back room and I show you my--
BUFFY	Finish that sentence and I guarantee you won't have anything to show.
XANDER	What is it?
MAN	It's magic, very powerful. Look at it. You'll see what I've seen. Feel what I felt.
XANDER	(a bellow) Anya!
SARAH	Get the hell away from me! Dad, Josh is teasing me.
JOSH	Sarah's a weirdo! Sarah's a weirdo!
ANYA	What.
XANDER	You're going out again?
ANYA	I'm doing a make-over party.
XANDER	I thought you hated those.
ANYA	Well. One of us has to make some money.
XANDER	What do you want me to do, Anya!? I can't work. My back is shot!
ANYA	And whose fault is that?
XANDER	Not the Buffy thing again-
ANYA	Well, what were you doing running around playing the hero?! You had no business fighting demons with her-
XANDER	You used to love it. You loved that I was part of the Slayer's team-
ANYA	Yeah, it was so hot the way you almost got paralyzed.
XANDER	Well, maybe if you'd been there for a change, backing me up-
ANYA	I was working! You stopped, remember? Everything stopped when you had to save the world-
XANDER	(needs to believe it) Buffy needed me. I had to help.
ANYA	Well it didn't save her, did it? All it did was ruin our lives.
XANDER	I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!
XANDER	What?
JOSH	My Optomex stock is plunging.
ANYA	But you're still up for the day.
XANDER	Okay. But see, I was thinking we could put away the dohickey and talk. Like an actual family.
ANYA	At least he has an interest.
XANDER	At least he has your interests, you mean. Try to get the kid to talk about anything but the Dow-
ANYA	(under her breath) If it wasn't for his stock tips we wouldn't be out, eating someplace nice-
SARAH	Yeah, this place is really nice. You guys know I don't eat wheat.
JOSH	You don't eat anything. Freak.
SARAH	At least I'm not a mama's boy.
JOSH	At least I'm not a demonic freak.
SARAH	Dad! Make him cut it!
XANDER	Maybe you should talk to your mother about that.
ANYA	You've had too much wine.
XANDER	Have I? I'm just saying maybe you should talk to your daughter--
SARAH	I hate you guys!
JOSH	This sucks.
XANDER	Yeah, you should have. Maybe then I could have gotten some touch in the oughts.
ANYA	I wasn't the one who stopped touching-
XANDER	Oh ho! Maybe, but you weren't touching me -
ANYA	What did you expect? You never came near me after Buffy-
XANDER	Don't bring her into this-
ANYA	Fine. Forget her. Maybe you were just born to be a bitter, angry old man.
XANDER	(eyes narrowing with rage) Shut up.
ANYA	No! I want my life back! If I hadn't married you I could have been happy. I wouldn't have had to hate myself for the LAST THIRTY YEARS!
XANDER	SHUT UP!
MAN	I'm sorry. I didn't want to show you-
XANDER	What happened? What was that?
MAN	A glimpse of your future. Harnessed by magic. I'm so sorry--
XANDER	Is she okay? Is she okay? What did I do--
MAN	Listen. I don't have long here. The spell that brought me back, it won't last. You can change things. It doesn't have to go like this. But you can't marry Anya.
XANDER	But-
MAN	You'll hurt her less today then you will later. Believe me. Sometimes, two people - all they bring each other is pain.
SPIKE	Hello, Buffy.
BUFFY	Hey.
SPIKE	Happy occasion. You meet my friend?
BUFFY	Haven't met. She seems like a very nice attempt at making me jealous.
SPIKE	Is it working?
SPIKE	I'm sorry. Or... Good! You want us to go?
BUFFY	No, no... I mean, you have the right to... I mean I pretty much deserve...
SPIKE	That's not true, you... God this is hard.
BUFFY	I know.
SPIKE	I think we'll go.
BUFFY	Go where? To your place?
SPIKE	Yeah I suppose... that was the idea.
BUFFY	Yeah.
SPIKE	Evil.
BUFFY	Of course.
SPIKE	But I won't. Or I... I'll just go. Give 'em my best or whatever. The happy couple.
BUFFY	I will.
SPIKE	It's nice, watching you be happy. For them, even. I don't see it a lot. You, um... you glow.
BUFFY	That's because my dress is radioactive.
SPIKE	Yeah...
BUFFY	Yeah.
SPIKE	(very quiet.) Thanks.
BUFFY	(just as quiet) Welcome.
SPIKE	Come on, let's go.
GIRL	What about the wedding?
SPIKE	Let's just piss off, all right?
WILLOW	I'll say this for the Y chromosome: looks good in a tux.
XANDER	Your double X's aren't doing so bad there, either.
WILLOW	You're getting married. My little Xander.
XANDER	All growed up.
WILLOW	It's a good thing I realized I was gay. 'Cause otherwise, hey, you, me and formal wear...
XANDER	Mmm... 'bout half as much as I love you?
WILLOW	Ready for the long walk?
XANDER	Um... can you give me a sec? I want to go over my vows.
WILLOW	Take your time. Not like they can start the wedding without you.
ANYA	'I promise to cherish you...' Eew, no! "Cherish?" 'I promise to have sex with you whenever...I want, and pledge to be your friend and your wife and your confidant and your sex poodle and--'
TARA	Sex poodle?
ANYA	Yeah, why?
TARA	Uh, I'm not sure you should say 'sex poodle' in your vows.
ANYA	Huh.
ANYA	The music! They're playing the music! This is it...
BUFFY	Are you ready, Ahn?
WILLOW	He's gone. Xander's disappeared.
BUFFY	What! Xander's gone? What do we do?
WILLOW	I'm going to look, I'm going to find him. And you're going to stall.
BUFFY	Sorry about that. Uh, it looks like there's going to be a little delay.
ANYA	Why? What's wrong?
BUFFY	Nothing, nothing. Just, um, the, uh, minister! He's got to go perform an emergency...C-section and, uh--
ANYA	A C-section?
BUFFY	Oh yes, he's a doctor as well as a minister. He's like, half- minister, half-doctor. A mini- tor. Not, of course, to be confused with a minotaur! Because he's all man, this minister-doctor man, no bull parts, whatsoever.
ANYA	Uh-huh.
BUFFY	So anyway, it oughta just be a couple of minutes.
ANYA	Okay.
KAREN	I'm bored.
CAROL	It's a wedding, honey. We're all bored.
HALFREK	...and I can't figure out why there's no food, does she actually want us to pass out from hunger?
HOFFRYN	(ignoring her) Something's wrong, I should... something's wrong.
BUFFY	No, no... This isn't it... It's not what you think...
CAROL	Beautiful.
ANYA	I am sorry, but what the hell is that minister thinking?
TARA	I don't know, he--
ANYA	Delivering a baby on my special day! It's totally rude of him and the mother. He should have just told her to hold it!
HARRIS	Double shot of Jack.
HARRIS	(looking around at the crowd) This is a disaster.
HARRIS	It's that Anya, I know it. She made us pay for everything and now she's going to foul it up. Women.
HARRIS	She didn't want my help. I offered.
HALFREK	Oh, this thing totally isn't happening. We should have known she would never--
HOFFRYN	I'm worried about Anya
HALFREK	Oh, sure. Of course you are.
HOFFRYN	Halfrek, you know I love all my demons equally.
CAROL	Buffy, you gotta do something!
BUFFY	So...who here's from out of town?
TEEN	My family is worse.
DAWN	No way. Mine is so messed up you have no idea.
TEEN	Wait 'til you see my mother dance at the reception. Then tell me who's messed up.
DAWN	I guess they're all messed up.
TEEN	Yeah. Everybody's pretty lame.
TARA	Anya, wait up!
ANYA	This bride waits for no one. If the minister's not here yet, well, we'll just have to get married without a minister!
TEEN	Jeez. What's the hold up?
DAWN	Can you keep a secret?
ANYA	What?
DAWN	Um...
TEEN	I'll catch you later Dawn.
ANYA	Xander is gone? Xander is missing? WHAT DO YOU MEAN XANDER IS MISSING!
RORY	It's a joke, he's joking. Like this one time, at one of Carol's weddings, I had this ape suit--
DEMON	Oh, good. Another Harris family joke.
RORY	Well, hey, buddy. I'm just kiddin' around. Someone's gotta lighten the mood.
DEMON	(sotto to Clem) She's got warts, too
CAROL	What?
HARRIS	Why not? Beauty and the beast. Or - beast and the beast!
DEMON	I think you've had enough. Again.
HARRIS	Drinking. Is the only way. I can dull the pain of looking. At your. Ugly. Face.
DEMON	You better think real hard about this, Harris.
HARRIS	Don't you touch me with those nasty circus things.
DEMON	That's it!
TARA	Ow! Ew!
BUFFY	Hey, break it up!
ANYA	When did you see Xander last?
CAROL	Well, I saw him go into the Trophy Room with that guy!
ANYA	You. You were talking to Xander right before he left!
MAN	Really doesn't matter now does it. It's done.
ANYA	What's done?! Did you--? If you said something to make him leave...
MAN	You'll what? Haven't changed a bit. Still as vindictive as ever.
ANYA	Do I know you?
MAN	You don't recognize me, Anya? I'm not the man I used to be, I know, but they say eyes are windows to the soul.
ANYA	Xander. Where is he?!
MAN	Why? He left because of you.
ANYA	I - I didn't do anything.
MAN	Oh, really. What about this?
CREATURE	You did this. You brought this on!
CLEM	Uh-oh.
ANYA	Tell me what you did with Xander!
CREATURE	You don't recognize me?
ANYA	No! What did you do to him?
CREATURE	I've waited a long time for this, Anyanka .
BUFFY	Anya!
ANYA	Who. Are. You.
CREATURE	Remember Chicago? South side, 1914?
I	remember you. But then again, you ruined my life.
ANYA	You were... I punished you.
CREATURE	That's right. Some hussie I'd been taking around summons you, and next thing I know, I look like this and I'm being tortured in another dimension.
ANYA	I... I forgot.
CREATURE	Well, I didn't. Every day I remembered and every day I thought about how I would somehow get back here and ruin your life like you ruined mine.
ANYA	But how--
CREATURE	Black magic. And plenty of time. I practiced and practiced until today. It didn't take much either. I scared off your fiance with just a couple phony visions.
ANYA	Visions of what?
CREATURE	Your future. Or his nightmare vision of your future.
ANYA	That's it? That's all you did?
CREATURE	Yeah, it was easy. Look at that: you're crying. Oh, I like that!
ANYA	S-stop it.
CREATURE	Oh, cry, Anyanka, cry. I love to see you cry. Now, I'd love to see you scream!
XANDER	Anya!
ANYA	Xander!
CREATURE	AAAAaaarrggh!
XANDER	Are you alright?
ANYA	I'm...I'm so glad you're back. It's all lies; what he showed you, it was all made up! He just wanted to break us apart.
XANDER	Oh, it... it doesn't matter now.
ANYA	We're going to be okay.
XANDER	It's dead.
BUFFY	Yep.
WILLOW	Anyone else waiting for it to go 'poof'? Maybe we can cover it with flowers.
HARRIS	(re: the damage) I am not paying for this, you freaks!
DEMON	Stop. Calling. Us. Freaks!
TARA	Thanks.
WILLOW	You okay?
TARA	Yeah.
ANYA	STOP IT! EVERYONE SIT DOWN!
ANYA	You know, it's bad luck for you to see me in my dress.
XANDER	I know.
ANYA	So, we're ready now. Let's go get married.
XANDER	I... I'm not.
ANYA	But it wasn't real. What he showed you, it wasn't--
XANDER	I know it wasn't. But - it could be.
ANYA	What was it? Was it about me? He wants you to hate me, Xander-
XANDER	It wasn't you. It wasn't you I was hating- I've had thoughts, fears before this. Maybe we went too fast-
ANYA	Everyone has 'thoughts' Xander. It's natural- it doesn't mean getting married is wrong-
XANDER	I know, I know- but-
ANYA	You're just shaken up, okay? Just calm down and then we'll start over. Okay?
XANDER	But we can't start over. If this is a mistake. It's forever. And I don't want to hurt you...
DAWN	Shouldn't we do something for her? Anything!
WILLOW	She wants to be alone. That's what she wants. Oh god, it hurts my heart to think of her.
BUFFY	I know. The whole thing hurts my heart.
DAWN	I thought they were happy.
BUFFY	They were. I know they were. They were my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.
DAWN	Why did this happen?
WILLOW	I don't know. I mean, I feel like I should be hating Xander. But I can't I just. I just hope he's okay.
DAWN	I wonder where he is.
MANAGER	Not much to explain here. The air conditioner's bust.
ANYA	I'm tired of crying. I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn.
HOFFRYN	Oh, Anyanka. I'm sorry. You let him domesticate you. When you were a vengeance demon you were powerful, at the top of your game. You crushed men like him.

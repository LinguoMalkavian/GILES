XANDER	Okay okay... I'm coming... I'm up...
XANDER	Buffy?
BUFFY	Where's Spike?
XANDER	Spike?
BUFFY	Spike, Xander -- Is he here?
XANDER	N-no. He's out. I think. Least he was when I got home.
BUFFY	Any idea where he went?
XANDER	I dunno. Creature of the night, Buff. He's out ... creaturing. Why? What's happened?
BUFFY	I hope not.
ROBSON	Nora?
ROBSON	Nora ... What--
WILLOW	Buffy!
WILLOW	Oh my God. Dawn, what happened here? What--?
DAWN	I'm all right...
WILLOW	Let me see. Make sure--
WILLOW	What?
DAWN	She was here, Willow. I saw her. And... And she spoke to me...
WILLOW	Oh, Sweetie...
DAWN	She was right here. And then she wasn't. She--
WILLOW	It wasn't her.
DAWN	W-what?
WILLOW	At least, I don't think it... I saw something, too. And it looked like... Someone else. But it wasn't...
DAWN	I don't understand...
WILLOW	It's the bad thing, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
DAWN	But... That's what she said. Mom. She said things were coming. Things were on their way and...
WILLOW	I-I don't know, Dawn. I'm just not sure we can trust anything right--
DAWN	So maybe the evil thing messing with you was here, too. Only maybe it was the thing trying to keep Mom away... 'Cause she was trying to protect me.
XANDER	Why would a vampire lie about who sired him? What's that, some kinda status symbol for the undead -- My sire can beat up your sire?
XANDER	You just don't want to.
BUFFY	Spike can't be doing this, Xander. He couldn't if he wanted to.
XANDER	Why not?
BUFFY	Well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.
XANDER	Didn't stop him from hurting you.
BUFFY	It's working. I've seen it.
XANDER	Is it? Or is that what Spike wants you to think?
BUFFY	You think it's an act?
XANDER	Me? Can't. I'm objective guy. I don't really know. And neither do you.
BUFFY	No, there's something... He's different. Changed. I feel it. If it's an act, then the Oscar goes to...
XANDER	Well, don't leave me hanging. Who?
SPIKE	Well, This can't be good. You being here at this hour. Trouble?
BUFFY	Trouble...
SPIKE	Right, none of my business. No worries.
BUFFY	Spike...
SPIKE	S'alright.
BUFFY	Just one. Vampire. Used to be someone I knew. A little. His name was Holden. Holden Webster.
XANDER	From high school? You didn't tell me the vamp you dusted was Holden "Call Me 'Webs'" Webster. Nobody called him "Webs." Went to school with him for ten years, not once did anyone ever--
SPIKE	Knew him, huh. That musta been a picnic.
BUFFY	Yeah.
SPIKE	Well... I'm qonna turn in before I drop. 'Night.
XANDER	You see that? See how he reacted when you mentioned "Webs?" Cool as Cool Whip. What's up with that?
BUFFY	Sun's coming up. I have to go home. Check on Dawn. We need to keep an eye on Spike.
XANDER	Whoa. By "we," you mean "me" and me's gotta go to work. I've got a big client meeting in a couple of hours.
BUFFY	Xander, this is serious. We can't let him go out again until we know if he's killing people. We have to find someone to watch him.
ANYA	Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
XANDER	C'mon, Anya. You said you'd do it on the phone.
ANYA	Yeah, that was before you told me Spike's killing again. Now you want to leave me here alone with him.
XANDER	Didn't mind being alone with him before.
ANYA	What was that?
XANDER	Nothing. Look, we don't actually know that he's killed anyone. Y'know... Lately. Might all just be a mistake.
ANYA	But you don't think so.
XANDER	Y'know. Didn't occur to me to look. But thanks for the tip. Okay, you'll be safe out here. Plenty of sunlight to hide in.
ANYA	That's it? Aren't you going to, at least, leave me a crossbow or a flame thrower... something to protect myself.
XANDER	We don't want him to know we suspect Anything.
ANYA	Better be. 'Cause if I get vamped, I'm gonna bite your ass.
XANDER	Wouldn't be the first time.
ANYA	What was that?
BUFFY	Dawn?
WILLOW	She's here. She's okay. She's not hurt. Just exhausted. Finally fell off to sleep.
BUFFY	What the hell happened? Downstairs looks like...
WILLOW	Hell happened? This Big Evil that keeps promising to devour us? I think it started chomping.
BUFFY	Oh, god... and it started with Dawn?!
WILLOW	Both of us. Buffy... this thing knows us. Made us think we were talking to people we knew. Mine said it came with a message from Tara, but Dawn actually saw...
BUFFY	Dawn actually saw what? Willow, who did she --
WILLOW	Your mother.
BUFFY	Dawnie...
WILLOW	Buff. This thing. It had me for a while. Before letting loose with all the, you know, pulse-pounding terror. But before that, the lies were very... convincing. It seemed real.
BUFFY	Lies...
BUFFY	A vampire I killed last night told me Spike sired him. Two nights ago.
WILLOW	Well... That's impossible, right? It's another fake-out, you got one, too. Wasn't a real vamp--
WILLOW	Buffy, do you really think Spike is--?
BUFFY	I can't... I really hope not.
SPIKE	Anya. Do be specific and tell a fella just what exactly you are doing here.
ANYA	Well... Spike... I... am here, obviously, because of the reason which I am about to tell you, with the following words, and that reason is... uh, clearly and obviously too, um... Sex.
SPIKE	Beg pardon?
ANYA	You and me. Here and now, let's go, let's... get it on, you big bad boy.
SPIKE	Wait - wait Anya, just a minute now, this is not exactly... is that a stake?
ANYA	Yes! Kinky .
SPIKE	Yeah, I guess, but what are you...
ANYA	Shh! No questions. No talking. I don't want any sounds to ruin the sweet, sweet love you know is still burning like a, um...
SPIKE	Zipper stuck?
ANYA	It's in my hair.
SPIKE	Anya...
ANYA	What? I can't help it. I can't stop thinking about you, and us, and the brief but unforgettable time we had together - I mean... Why else would I be here? It's not like I'm snooping around for proof you're some kind of whacked-out serial killer.
SPIKE	Not so much.
ANYA	Mmm?
ANYA	I get it. Buffy.
SPIKE	Obviously, if things were different, you're a right catch.
ANYA	Got it No problem. I understand. (beat, genuinely offended) You think I'm fat.
SPIKE	What?
ANYA	Well, it's that or the haircut.
SPIKE	Nonsense! The do's quite fetching.
ANYA	Oh - right - now you like the haircut.
SPIKE	Love it!
ANYA	Sure, as a friend.
SPIKE	Anya...
ANYA	You know you're more fun without the soul.
SPIKE	Oh come on now, I just explained to you...
ANYA	I'm only saying, Soulless Spike woulda had me upside down and halfway to Happy Land by now.
SPIKE	I need my pants.
SPIKE	Didn't mean to hurt your feelings, luv.
ANYA	Who's hurt? I'm fine.
SPIKE	Right. Look it's getting dark, I've got things to do.
ANYA	Don't stick around on my account.
BUFFY	Got it. I'm on it. Thanks. What? Of course you're not fat, why would you...
POLICEMAN	You sure do walk fast.
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
POLICEMAN	Been trying to catch up to you since that last intersection there. The one you walked across. Without the benefit of a crosswalk.
BUFFY	What?
POLICEMAN	Jaywalking. Now, normally I'd give you a warning-
BUFFY	It's okay. Give me the ticket.
POLICEMAN	You realize you crossed about twenty feet in front of a moving vehicle
BUFFY	Seriously, it's fine. Just give it to me. Officer.
POLICEMAN	Not so fast. Address and signature.
BUFFY	You've got to be kidding me...
POLICEMAN	You know, I don't like your attitude-
BUFFY	Yeah, I've been saying that about me for years...
LINDA	So, what kind of name is "Spike?"
LINDA	What, you gonna make me guess? All right, I'll guess you're... a little bit bad?
LINDA	Am I right? Are you a bad boy? 'Cause I don't mind. I was getting kinda bored of waiting on line. I hate waiting.
BUFFY	Evening, Spike.
SPIKE	Buffy?
LINDA	No. Linda. Who's Buffy?
BUFFY	You know you want it.
LINDA	Um... is everything...?
BUFFY	There's my guy.
FIRST	Now, doesn't that feel better?
FIRST	I'll be seeing you.
BUFFY	Did you kill her?
SPIKE	What?
BUFFY	The girl. Last night.
SPIKE	What girl? What are you talking about?
BUFFY	I caught the first act. Missed the curtain. Did you kill her? Turn her? Is she one of your kind now?
SPIKE	Did you... Are you following me?
BUFFY	Answer me, Spike. Where's that girl?
SPIKE	Who knows? I talked to her, is all!
BUFFY	Looked like more than talking-
SPIKE	Well I sure as hell didn't off her. Where are you getting this? You know I can't -
BUFFY	Right, the chip. But-
SPIKE	Not the chip. Not the chip, damn it - You honestly think I'd go to the end of the underworld and back to get my soul, and then start killing again? Buffy - I can barely live with what I did when I was William the Bloody. It haunts me. All of it. You think I'd add to the body count now, you're crazy-
BUFFY	So you just troll the promenade for drunk co-eds because you're hungry for conversation .
SPIKE	Is that what this is. Right...
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	You're jealous.
BUFFY	Don't play games, not now-
SPIKE	You saw me chatting up a bird, giving the eye to someone else? Struck a nerve, did it?
BUFFY	Don't flatter yourself-
SPIKE	It burns, huh? But you can't admit it, so you trump up some story about me being back on the juice-
BUFFY	It's not a story! This vampire I killed, he told me-
SPIKE	Told you what? That I go out? Yeah, I talk to people, women. I talk to them because I can't talk to you.
BUFFY	Spike-
SPIKE	And as daft a notion as "Soulful Spike the killer" is, it's nothing compared to the idea that some other girl could mean anything to me. This chip is something they did to me. I couldn't help it. But the soul I got on my own. For you.
BUFFY	I know. But-
SPIKE	And everything I felt, feel - it only cuts deeper now. I pass the time with someone... That's all it is - time. God help me, Buffy, it's still all about you.
BUFFY	Spike. This vampire told me you were his sire.
SPIKE	That doesn't mean-
BUFFY	He said you killed him last week. Dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.
SPIKE	And you believe him? Vampires, not notorious for their honesty-
BUFFY	I did follow you last night. You didn't look casual. Or lonely. You looked like you were on the prowl.
SPIKE	You can't know that-
BUFFY	So what were you doing? Just tell me. You picked up that girl. Then what?
SPIKE	We talked. That's all I remember.
BUFFY	All you remember?
SPIKE	I don't know - the nights... I go out. I talk to people. Or I don't. It's boring. It all bleeds together.
BUFFY	So if you forget so much-
SPIKE	Not that. The taste of human blood? That I'd remember-
BUFFY	Spike. You were camped on the Hellmouth talking to invisible people. Recently. How can you be sure what you've been-
SPIKE	No . You're wrong. You've got an accusation from a pile of dust - and not a shred of proof.
BUFFY	So I'll get some.
SPIKE	And if you don't? What's it going to take to make you believe in me?
BUFFY	Guys, find me some evidence that he did this, okay?
ANYA	Really? Is that what you want?
BUFFY	Or find me some proof he didn't. I don't know.
DAWN	You only think Spike is turning people because that vampire told you so, right? But that night... I mean, we were all told stuff that wasn't true.
WILLOW	Maybe.
DAWN	What? What maybe?
WILLOW	Just because those weren't the spirits of, you know, our people... just because they were some evil thing, it doesn't mean what they said can't be true.
ANYA	I used to tell the truth all the time when I was evil.
BUFFY	We can't assume anything. We need hard facts.
ANYA	Well, if Spike is biting people then there should be more dead people with neck trauma, right? We can find that.
WILLOW	No.
ANYA	We can't find that? But that's easy. That computer is a moron.
WILLOW	I mean, no, there's not really an increase in neck injuries, but...
BUFFY	But?
WILLOW	Missing people. Maybe eight, oh, ten of 'em. No bodies, they're just... missing, mostly young, lotsa girls...
DAWN	So it's true? What the vampire told Buffy turned out to be true.
BUFFY	Maybe. But it still doesn't prove it's Spike. Right now, he's still the only one knows who for sure.
XANDER	No, no. You're not going out.
SPIKE	I have to go.
XANDER	Buffy was very clear about the not- leaving-of you.
SPIKE	I know what the Slayer told you. It's not true. Let me go and I'll find a way to prove it.
XANDER	Okay, I'm gonna list the reasons that won't happen. One--
SPIKE	She had brown hair. Nice looking girl. I was here talkin' with her...
SPIKE	...two nights ago. I'm looking for someone mighta seen her...
BUFFY	He hit you?
XANDER	Knocked me out. He's been gone at least a half-hour.
BUFFY	Any idea where he was headed?
SPIKE	What's that?
CHARLOTTE	Way you're scanning that crowd; you look like you're out for blood.
SPIKE	Just looking for a certain brunette I met here the other night.
CHARLOTTE	I'm a brunette. Is it me?
SPIKE	Sorry, luv. Don't think so.
CHARLOTTE	Not even if I ask nice? You the type that has to be... convinced?
SPIKE	Friendly Warning, pet. I'm the type best left alone.
CHARLOTTE	Should we pick off the crowd one by one or block the exits and ravish the place?
SPIKE	Get away from me.
CHARLOTTE	What's with the wallflower act? Didn't seem so shy when you were biting me.
SPIKE	No... I didn't... That wasn't me.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah, all right. Sure. I'm not asking if you want to be soul mates . Just figured you'd want to have some fun.
CHARLOTTE	I take him, you take her? Or the other way round, whatever...
SPIKE	No.
CHARLOTTE	Get off!
BOUNCER	Sweetheart, you wanna go on in? Go 'head.
BUFFY	I need some help. I'm looking for this guy -- bleached-blonde hair, leather jacket, British accent, kinda... sallow, but in a hot way --
BOUNCER	Yeah, yeah, I know the guy -- Billy Idol wannabe?
BUFFY	Actually, Billy Idol stole his look from... Never mind. Has he been here?
BOUNCER	This guy... he your boyfriend or something?
BUFFY	No . I just need to find him. As soon as possible.
BOUNCER	Yeah, he comes here a lot lately. Always leaves with a different girl. Chicks like Billy Idol.
BUFFY	How many girls?
BOUNCER	Look... this guy. This "not-your- boyfriend" guy. I'd lose him if I were you. He's a real player.
MANN	Man, I hate playing vampire towns.
SPIKE	It's me. I... I'm seeing... I think I remember... I think I've done some very bad things.
BUFFY	Where are you?
SPIKE	I need... I need to see you... There's a house. 634 Hoffman Terrace.
BUFFY	I'll meet you.
FIRST	You weren't supposed to do that.
BUFFY	Hello? Spike?
SPIKE	I did some bad things here.
SPIKE	Down here.
FIRST	There's an order. Slayer's not in order. But it doesn't hurt to play. Get your claws in the mouse, y'know?
SPIKE	You're not here.
BUFFY	All right. So what do you need to show me?
SPIKE	I've... I've been remembering. A girl. I walked her home. The one you saw. And the one before that...
BUFFY	Spike.
SPIKE	Over here. I think I buried them here.
BUFFY	Oh God, Spike. Why?
SPIKE	Well I dunno, do I? Don't even know how. I shouldn't be able...
FIRST	"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places/that this heart of mine embraces..."
BUFFY	What is it?
FIRST	And it's just about to get fun...
BUFFY	Oh god.
FIRST	You know what I want you to do.
BUFFY	Spike! No!
FIRST	Help your children.
SPIKE	I remember.
FIRST	You failed them Now she's gonna kill you. You lose, mate.
BUFFY	Sorry, ma'am. It's my job.
SPIKE	Do it fast, all right?
BUFFY	Who said?
SPIKE	Me. It was me. I saw it. I was here the whole time. Talking. and singing. There was a song...
BUFFY	What are you talking about?
SPIKE	I don't know. Please, I don't remember. Don't make me remember. Make it so I forget again! I did what you wanted!
BUFFY	There's something here.
SPIKE	No, please... I need it. I can't cry this soul out of me. It won't come. And I... killed... And I feel it... I feel every one of them...
BUFFY	Something's playing with us, Spike. All of us.
SPIKE	What is it? Why is it doing this to me?
BUFFY	I don't know.
SPIKE	Help me. Can you help me? I don't know why I did this. Or how I did this. And I'm... I need help.
BUFFY	I'll help you.
XANDER	And you believe him?
BUFFY	You didn't see him down there. He really didn't know what he'd done. Like it wasn't in his control.
ANYA	Oh, an out-of-control serial killer. You're right, that is a great house guest.
DAWN	Wait. Is he... is he staying here?
BUFFY	Maybe. I'm not letting him Out of my sight. That is for sure.
WILLOW	Buffy, he's been feeding. On human blood. That's gonna do stuff...
ANYA	He's not done being dangerous. Buffy, you keep him around, you're taking on a huge project.
XANDER	But it'll be fun. No wait, I mean it'll get us all killed.
BUFFY	I'm not keeping him around just to help him. I think... I think there was something there. Talking to him. Making him do things.
WILLOW	Something like what talked to us?
BUFFY	Yeah, maybe. And if it is the same thing, it's been screwing with Spike big time.
XANDER	So you want him around because...
BUFFY	Look, something evil is working us. If we're going to have a chance against it, we'll have to learn everything we can about it. This thing has been closer to Spike than any of us.
WILLOW	So if you want to understand it-
BUFFY	I'm going to have to get close to Spike.
XANDER	It's too dangerous.
BUFFY	I don't have a choice. What ever this thing - "From beneath us" is - it's bad. And it's only getting worse.
GILES	Dear God.
ROBSON	Gather them.
GILES	What?
ROBSON	It's started.
GILES	It's alright. I understand. I'll take care--
XANDER	Buffy?
BUFFY	Where's Spike?
XANDER	Spike?
BUFFY	Spike, Xander -- Is he here?
XANDER	N-no. He's out. I think. Least he was when I got home.
BUFFY	Any idea where he went?
XANDER	I dunno. Creature of the night, Buff. He's out ... creaturing. Why? What's happened?
BUFFY	I hope not.
DAWN	I'm all right...
WILLOW	Let me see. Make sure--
WILLOW	What?
DAWN	She was here, Willow. I saw her. And... And she spoke to me...
WILLOW	Oh, Sweetie...
DAWN	She was right here. And then she wasn't. She--
WILLOW	It wasn't her.
DAWN	W-what?
WILLOW	At least, I don't think it... I saw something, too. And it looked like... Someone else. But it wasn't...
DAWN	I don't understand...
WILLOW	It's the bad thing, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
WILLOW	I-I don't know, Dawn. I'm just not sure we can trust anything right--
DAWN	So maybe the evil thing messing with you was here, too. Only maybe it was the thing trying to keep Mom away... 'Cause she was trying to protect me.
XANDER	Why would a vampire lie about who sired him? What's that, some kinda status symbol for the undead -- My sire can beat up your sire?
XANDER	You just don't want to.
BUFFY	Spike can't be doing this, Xander. He couldn't if he wanted to.
XANDER	Why not?
BUFFY	Well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.
XANDER	Didn't stop him from hurting you.
BUFFY	It's working. I've seen it.
XANDER	Is it? Or is that what Spike wants you to think?
BUFFY	You think it's an act?
XANDER	Me? Can't. I'm objective guy. I don't really know. And neither do you.
BUFFY	No, there's something... He's different. Changed. I feel it. If it's an act, then the Oscar goes to...
XANDER	Well, don't leave me hanging. Who?
SPIKE	Well, This can't be good. You being here at this hour. Trouble?
BUFFY	Trouble...
SPIKE	S'alright.
BUFFY	Just one. Vampire. Used to be someone I knew. A little. His name was Holden. Holden Webster.

SPIKE	Right. Look it's getting dark, I've got things to do.

SPIKE	I don't know - the nights... I go out. I talk to people. Or I don't. It's boring. It all bleeds together.
BUFFY	So if you forget so much-
SPIKE	Not that. The taste of human blood? That I'd remember-
BUFFY	Spike. You were camped on the Hellmouth talking to invisible people. Recently. How can you be sure what you've been-
SPIKE	No . You're wrong. You've got an accusation from a pile of dust - and not a shred of proof.
BUFFY	So I'll get some.
SPIKE	And if you don't? What's it going to take to make you believe in me?
BUFFY	Guys, find me some evidence that he did this, okay?
ANYA	Really? Is that what you want?
BUFFY	Or find me some proof he didn't. I don't know.
DAWN	You only think Spike is turning people because that vampire told you so, right? But that night... I mean, we were all told stuff that wasn't true.
WILLOW	Maybe.
DAWN	What? What maybe?
ANYA	I used to tell the truth all the time when I was evil.
BUFFY	We can't assume anything. We need hard facts.
ANYA	Well, if Spike is biting people then there should be more dead people with neck trauma, right? We can find that.
WILLOW	No.
ANYA	We can't find that? But that's easy. That computer is a moron.
WILLOW	I mean, no, there's not really an increase in neck injuries, but...
BUFFY	But?
WILLOW	Missing people. Maybe eight, oh, ten of 'em. No bodies, they're just... missing, mostly young, lotsa girls...
DAWN	So it's true? What the vampire told Buffy turned out to be true.
BUFFY	Maybe. But it still doesn't prove it's Spike. Right now, he's still the only one knows who for sure.
XANDER	No, no. You're not going out.
SPIKE	I have to go.
XANDER	Buffy was very clear about the not- leaving-of you.
SPIKE	I know what the Slayer told you. It's not true. Let me go and I'll find a way to prove it.
XANDER	Okay, I'm gonna list the reasons that won't happen. One--
XANDER	Knocked me out. He's been gone at least a half-hour.
BUFFY	Any idea where he was headed?
SPIKE	What's that?
CHARLOTTE	Way you're scanning that crowd; you look like you're out for blood.
SPIKE	Just looking for a certain brunette I met here the other night.
CHARLOTTE	I'm a brunette. Is it me?
SPIKE	Sorry, luv. Don't think so.
CHARLOTTE	Not even if I ask nice? You the type that has to be... convinced?
SPIKE	Friendly Warning, pet. I'm the type best left alone.
CHARLOTTE	Should we pick off the crowd one by one or block the exits and ravish the place?
SPIKE	Get away from me.
CHARLOTTE	What's with the wallflower act? Didn't seem so shy when you were biting me.
SPIKE	No... I didn't... That wasn't me.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah, all right. Sure. I'm not asking if you want to be soul mates . Just figured you'd want to have some fun.
SPIKE	No.
CHARLOTTE	Get off!
BOUNCER	Sweetheart, you wanna go on in? Go 'head.
BUFFY	I need some help. I'm looking for this guy -- bleached-blonde hair, leather jacket, British accent, kinda... sallow, but in a hot way --
BOUNCER	Yeah, yeah, I know the guy -- Billy Idol wannabe?
BUFFY	Actually, Billy Idol stole his look from... Never mind. Has he been here?
BOUNCER	This guy... he your boyfriend or something?
BUFFY	No . I just need to find him. As soon as possible.
BOUNCER	Yeah, he comes here a lot lately. Always leaves with a different girl. Chicks like Billy Idol.
BUFFY	Where are you?
SPIKE	I need... I need to see you... There's a house. 634 Hoffman Terrace.
BUFFY	I'll meet you.
BUFFY	Spike.
SPIKE	Over here. I think I buried them here.
SPIKE	Well I dunno, do I? Don't even know how. I shouldn't be able...
FIRST	"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places/that this heart of mine embraces..."
BUFFY	Who said?
SPIKE	Me. It was me. I saw it. I was here the whole time. Talking. and singing. There was a song...
BUFFY	What are you talking about?
SPIKE	What is it? Why is it doing this to me?
BUFFY	I don't know.
XANDER	And you believe him?
BUFFY	You didn't see him down there. He really didn't know what he'd done. Like it wasn't in his control.
ANYA	Oh, an out-of-control serial killer. You're right, that is a great house guest.
DAWN	Wait. Is he... is he staying here?
BUFFY	Maybe. I'm not letting him Out of my sight. That is for sure.
WILLOW	Buffy, he's been feeding. On human blood. That's gonna do stuff...
ANYA	He's not done being dangerous. Buffy, you keep him around, you're taking on a huge project.
XANDER	But it'll be fun. No wait, I mean it'll get us all killed.
BUFFY	I'm not keeping him around just to help him. I think... I think there was something there. Talking to him. Making him do things.
WILLOW	Something like what talked to us?
BUFFY	Yeah, maybe. And if it is the same thing, it's been screwing with Spike big time.
XANDER	So you want him around because...
BUFFY	Look, something evil is working us. If we're going to have a chance against it, we'll have to learn everything we can about it. This thing has been closer to Spike than any of us.
WILLOW	So if you want to understand it-
BUFFY	I'm going to have to get close to Spike.
XANDER	It's too dangerous.
BUFFY	I don't have a choice. What ever this thing - "From beneath us" is - it's bad. And it's only getting worse.
ROBSON	Gather them.
GILES	What?
ROBSON	It's started.

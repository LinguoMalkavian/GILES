XANDER	Is she dying?
BUFFY	She’s singing.
XANDER	To a telephone, in Urdu… now that’s entertainment. Why is she singing?
WILLOW	She’s sad because her lover gave her a dozen gold coins but then the wizard cut open the bag of salt and the dancing minions had no place to put their big Maypole… …fish thing.
XANDER	Uh huh. And why is she singing ?
BUFFY	Her lover? I thought he was her chiropractor.
WILLOW	Because of that thing he did with her feet? No, that was personal.
XANDER	And we thought just ‘cause we didn’t have any money or anywhere to go this’d be a lackluster evening.
WILLOW	Hey, I know – we could go to the Bronze, sneak in our own tea bags and ask for… hot water.
XANDER	Hop off that outlaw train, Will, before you land us all in jail.
BUFFY	I for one am giddy and up. There’s a kind of hush all over Sunnydale, no vampires or demons to slay, I’m here with my friends and— -- where does the water buffalo fit in again?
FIGURE	Callie… Where are you going?
FIGURE	The party ain’t even started yet.
CALLIE	No! No!
CORDELIA	Ha ha ha ha ha.
WILLOW	You dreamed about Angel again?
BUFFY	Third night in a row.
WILLOW	What did he do in the dream?
BUFFY	Stuff.
WILLOW	Ooh, stuff. Was it one of those vivid dreams where you could feel his lips and smell his hair?
BUFFY	It had surround sound. I’m just thinking about him so much lately.
WILLOW	Well you guys are so right for each other, except for the, uh…
BUFFY	Vampire thing?
WILLOW	That doesn’t make him a bad person. Necessarily.
BUFFY	I’m brainsick, I can’t have a relationship with him.
WILLOW	Well maybe not in the day time… but you could ask him for coffee some night. It’s the non-relationship drink of choice. It’s not a date, it’s a caffeinated beverage – okay it’s hot and bitter, like a relationship that way but —
XANDER	What’s like a relationship?
BUFFY	Nothing I have. Coffee.
XANDER	Huh?
CORDELIA	There’s really no comparison between college men and high school boys – -- I mean look at that.
XANDER	Cor, you datin’ a college guy now?
CORDELIA	Not that it’s any of your business, but I happen to be seeing a Delta Zeta Kappa.
XANDER	Oh, an extra-terrestrial, so that’s how you get a date once you’ve exhausted all the human guys.
CORDEDLIA	You’ll go to college some day, Xander. I just know your pizza delivery career will take you so many exciting places. Ha ha ha ha.
BUFFY	Oops, I told Giles I’d met him in the Library ten minutes ago – -- there hasn’t been much paranormal activity lately, he won’t be upset.
GILES	Just because the paranormal has been more normal and less… para lately, that is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down.
BUFFY	I haven’t let my guard down.
GILES	Oh really? You yawned your way through weapons training last week, you skipped hand to hand entirely – I suppose you’re prepared if some demon springs up behind you and does this!?
BUFFY	And the little scrap of my life that still belongs to me – say from seven to seven oh five in the morning – can I do what I want to then?
GILES	Buffy, you think I don’t know what it’s like to be sixteen?
BUFFY	No, I think you don’t know what it’s like to be sixteen and a girl and a Slayer.
GILES	I may not know precisely –
BUFFY	Or what it’s like to exterminate vampires while you’re having fuzzy feelings towards one.
GILES	You’re still…? That is dicey.
BUFFY	Yeah, digging on the undead doesn’t exactly bolster your social life.
GILES	Ahh, but you see that’s just where being different comes in handy.
BUFFY	Can’t have a social life anyway, too busy killing fiends from hell?
GILES	Yes! You have a duty, a purpose, you have a life long commitment. How many people your age do you think can say that?
BUFFY	We talkin’ foreign or domestic – how ‘bout none .
GILES	Well here’s a hard fact of life: we all have to do things we don’t like. You have hand to hand this afternoon and patrol tonight. You’d best come right here after sixth period and get your homework done. Don’t dawdle with your friends.
XANDER	Wow, what a long day.
WILLOW	You cut three periods.
XANDER	Yeah, and of course they flew by. Buffy!
WILLOW	Aren’t you s’posed to be doing your homework in the library –
BUFFY	I’m dawdling. With my friends.
XANDER	Works for me.
RICHARD	Cordelia.
CORDELIA	Hi Richard. Nice car.
BUFFY	Dawdle, dawdle, dawdle… I’m a rebel and I’ll never ever be any good…
RICHARD	So we’re having a little get together at the house tomorrow night…
CORDELIA	Oh I’d love to –
RICHARD	Who’s your friend?
CORDELIA	Her? She’s not my friend.
TOM	She’s amazing.
CORDELIA	She’s more like a sister, really. We’re that close.
RICHARD	Why don’t you introduce us?
XANDER	Okay so tonight, Channel fifty nine, Indian T.V. – sex, lies and incomprehensible story lines – I’ll bring the beetle nuts.
CORDELIA	Come on, Richard and his fraternity brothers want to meet you.
BUFFY	I don’t really want to meet any fraternity –
CORDELIA	And if there was a God, don’tcha’ think He’d keep it that way?
XANDER	Hey, I believe we were hanging here…
RICHARD	Hi, sweet thing. I’m Richard. And you are?
BUFFY	So not interested.
CORDELIA	She’s such a little comedienne!
RICHARD	What, is she playing hard to get?
TOM	No Richard, I think you’re playing easy to resist. (to Buffy) Feel free to ignore him. I do all the time.
XANDER	She’s gonna walk away… now. Okay boots, start walkin’…
BUFFY	I’m Buffy Summers.
TOM	Nice to meet you. Are you a Senior?
BUFFY	Junior.
TOM	Me too, except I’m a Senior, and in college. So, we have that in common. I major in History.
BUFFY	History stumps me. I have a hard enough time remembering what happened last week.
TOM	Nothing happened last week, don’t worry, I was there.
XANDER	I hate these guys. Whatever they want just falls into their laps. Don’t you hate these guys?
WILLOW	Yeah, with their charmed lives and their movie star good looks and more money than you can count… I’m hating.
TOM	So my friend asked your friend to this party we’re having tomorrow night… (lowers voice) … actually he’s not really my friend – I only joined the fraternity ‘cause my father and grampa were in it before me. It meant a lot to them. I know, I talk too much. Anyway, they’re really dull parties full of really dull people so, uh, how would you like to come and save me from a really dull fate?
BUFFY	I wish I could but… I’m sort of seeing someone.
TOM	Oh. Sure, of course you are. Well, thanks for letting me ramble…
BUFFY	People underestimate the value of a good ramble.
BUFFY	I gotta… nice to meet you
TOM	Same here.
GILES	I’m going to attack you. Word of caution: for your own good, I won’t be pulling any punches.
BUFFY	Please don’t.
GILES	Good. So you’re on patrol and I’ll see you in the morning. Thanks, no, I’ll just rest here for a while.
BUFFY	Oh… hi. Nice to… blood?
ANGEL	I can smell it.
BUFFY	It’s pretty thin, probably belonged to a girl.
ANGEL	Probably.
BUFFY	I was just mulling, wouldn’t it be funny to see each other some time when it wasn’t a blood thing?
ANGEL	What are you saying, you want to have a date?
BUFFY	No –
ANGEL	You don’t want to have a date.
BUFFY	Who said date? I never said date.
ANGEL	Right, you just want to have coffee or something.
BUFFY	Coffee?
ANGEL	I knew this would happen.
BUFFY	Really? And what do you think is happening?
ANGEL	You’re sixteen years old, I’m two hundred and forty.
BUFFY	I’ve done the math.
ANGEL	You don’t know what you’re doing, you don’t know what you want.
BUFFY	Oh I think I do: I want out of this conversation.
ANGEL	Listen. If we date you and I both know one thing’s going to lead to another. Then what?
BUFFY	Then… whatever, I don’t know, might be nice to find out. But you want to end it before it’s begun. Fine.
ANGEL	It’s a Fairy Tale. Only when I kiss you you don’t wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.
BUFFY	No. When you kiss me I want to die.
CORDELIA	Did you lose weight? And your hair… (Buffy ignores her) All right, I respect you too much to be dishonest, the hair’s… …well that’s not the point here, is it. The Delta Zetas have to have a certain balance at their party – Richard explained it all to me but I was so busy REALLY LISTENING to him that I didn’t hear much – anyway, the deal is they need you to go. And if you don’t go… …I can’t! I’m talking about Richard Anderson , okay? As in Anderson Farms, Anderson Textiles… … and Anderson Cosmetics! Do you have a hankie?
BUFFY	I’ll go.
CORDELIA	I’m not going to beg you – please, oh please – you’ll go? Great! We’ll just take my car. Oh Buffy, we’re just like sisters… with really different hair.
MAN	I pledge my life and my death…
RICHARD	To the Delta Zetas and to Machida whom we serve.
MAN	To the Delta Zetas and to Machida whom we serve.
RICHARD	In blood I was baptized, in blood I shall reign, in His Name!
MAN	In blood I was baptized, in blood I shall reign, in His Name!
RICHARD	You are now one of us.
MAN	In His Name!
RICHARD	Brewski time!
RICHARD	So what’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?
CALLIE	Please, let me go.
RICHARD	Let you go. Okay, let me think – uhhh, no.
WILLOW	What made you change your mind?
BUFFY	Angel.
WILLOW	He’s going with you? She’s got a date with Angel. Isn’t that exciting?
XANDER	I’m elated.
BUFFY	I’m not going with Angel. I’m going with… ye gods, Cordelia.
WILLOW	Cordelia ? Did I sound a little jealous just then? Cause I’m not really… Cordelia ?
XANDER	Cordelia’s much better for you than Angel.
WILLOW	What happened with Angel?
BUFFY	Nothing. As usual. A whole lot of nothing with Angel.
XANDER	Bummer.
WILLOW	I don’t understand. He likes you. More than likes.
BUFFY	The guy hardly ever says two words to me…
XANDER	Don’t you hate that.
BUFFY	… and he treats me like a child.
XANDER	That bastard!
BUFFY	At least Tom can carry on a conversation.
XANDER	Yeah, Tom – who’s Tom?
WILLOW	The frat guy.
XANDER	Oh, I don’t think so, Buffy, frying pan and the fire, know what I’m saying?
GILES	What if a vampire came up behind you and did that!
BUFFY	I found this.
WILLOW	I’ve seen something like that somewhere…
BUFFY	It’s broken in two, I don’t know what the other letters might have spelled… and there’s blood on it.
GILES	I don’t see –
BUFFY	Angel showed up. Said he could smell it.
XANDER	The blood. There’s a guy you want to party with.
GILES	Blood…
WILLOW	Yeah, in Sunnydale, what a surprise.
XANDER	She should probably make the rounds again tonight while we try and figure out who that bracelet belongs to.
GILES	Good idea. She’ll patrol, we’ll reconvene after school –
BUFFY	Hello, “she’s” standing right here. And she’s not available tonight.
GILES	Why not?
XANDER	Buff, this is a little more important than –
BUFFY	--I’ve got a mountain of homework, my mom’s sick and she needs me to take care of her, and I’m starting to feel a little woozy myself.
GILES	Oh, if you’re not feeling…
BUFFY	I’ll make a quick pass early this evening, and another one later on, but for the bulk of the evening…
GILES	You need to be home with your mother.
BUFFY	Well, say it.
XANDER	I’m not going to say it ‘cause –
WILLOW	You lied to Giles.
XANDER	-- she will.
BUFFY	I wasn’t lying. I was protecting him. From information he wouldn’t be able to… digest properly.
XANDER	Like a corn dog.
WILLOW	Like you don’t have a sick mother but you’d rather go to a Fraternity party where there’ll be drinking and older boys and probably an orgy?
XANDER	Enh! Rewind, when did they start having orgies and how come I’m not on the mailing list?
BUFFY	There’s no orgy.
WILLOW	I’ve heard some really wild things go on at the Delta Zeta parties.
BUFFY	Look, six days a week I’m busy saving the world. Once in a great while I want to have some fun. And that’s what I’m going to have tonight… fun.
CORDELIA	This isn’t about fun tonight. It’s about duty: your duty to help me achieve permanent prosperity. Okay, do’s and don’ts. Don’t wear black, silk, chiffon, or spandex – these are my trademarks – don’t do that weird thing to your hair.
BUFFY	What weird…?
CORDELIA	Don’t interrupt. Do be interested if someone should speak to you – may or may not happen – do be polite, do laugh at appropriate intervals – ha ha ha ha – and do lie to your mother about where we’re going: it’s a fraternity, there’ll be drinking.
XANDER	So Cor, are you printing up business cards with your pager number and hours of operation or just going with the halter top tonight?
CORDELIA	Ahh, are we a little envious? Don’t be, you could join a fraternity of rich, powerful men… in the Bizarro world.
BUFFY	You guys want to…
XANDER	Nah, I gotta digest and all.
CORDELIA	Make-up, make-up… well, just give it your all and keep to the shadows. We are going to have a blast!
WILLOW	I can’t believe she lied to Giles. My world is all askew.
XANDER	Buffy lying? Buffy going to frat parties? That’s not askew, that’s cockeyed!
WILLOW	Askew means cockeyed.
XANDER	Oh.
WILLOW	Well, there’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll help Giles –
XANDER	I’m going to the party.
WILLOW	What?
XANDER	I want to keep an eye on Buffy, those frat guys creep me.
WILLOW	You want to protect her. And you want to prove you’re as good as those rich, snotty guys. And maybe catch an orgy.
XANDER	If it’s on early.
CORDELIA	Why do they park so darn close to you? (to Buffy) You up for this?
BUFFY	I don’t know… maybe it isn’t such a good idea—
CORDELIA	Me too, let’s do it!
CORDELIA	You know what’s so cool about college? The diversity. You’ve got rich people and you’ve got… all the other people. Richard!
RICHARD	Welcome, ladies.
CORDELIA	Thank you.
BUFFY	Is there alcohol in this?
RICHARD	Just a smidge.
CORDELIA	C’mon Buffy, it’s just a smidge.
BUFFY	I’ll just…
RICHARD	I understand. When I was your age I wasn’t into grown-up things, either.
CORDELIA	The one with the cherry walnut paneling and the two forty-eight inch televisions on satellite feed? No, why don’t you show me?
CORDELIA	She’s happiest by herself.
TACKLE	Who… the heck… …are you.
XANDER	Stewart L. Huntington, Junior. The third. My people have been Delta since… a time that was in the past. Hunting – Hunsinger.
TACKLE	New girl. Dance. Ahhhyeeahh.
TOM	Could I have this dance?
BUFFY	Thanks for…
TOM	We’re not all a bunch of drunken louts. Some of us are sober louts. I’m really glad you decided to come. And you’re not.
BUFFY	No. It’s just… I shouldn’t be here.
TOM	Because you’re seeing someone.
BUFFY	No.
TOM	You’re not seeing someone.
BUFFY	Someone’s not seeing me.
TOM	So why shouldn’t you be here?
BUFFY	I have obligations, people I’m responsible to… or for… or with, it’s complex.
TOM	You’re big on responsibility. I like that. But there’s such a thing as too mature. You should relax and enjoy yourself once in a while. You think I’m too mature.
TOM	I talk too much. Have you picked up on that yet? Anyway, the Hulk is gone so you don’t have to dance with me any –
BUFFY	He might come back.
XANDER	Godzilla is attacking downtown Tokyo! Argh! Argh!
TACKLE	You went to Cold Springs with Donny Hunsinger. Is that his kid brother Stewy?
RICHARD	Stewy’s blond and six four. We got us a crasher.
XANDER	So have either of you seen a pair of girls Here? One is about so high –
RICHARD	New Pledge!
TACKLE	New Pledge!
TOM	You okay?
BUFFY	Yeah. I was just… thinking.
TOM	To… maturity.
BUFFY	Ahhh, what the hell.
WILLOW	Bent.
GILES	Sent.
WILLOW	Rent.
GILES	Lent.
WILLOW	Kent – Kent, that’s it!
GILES	Her boyfriend’s name is Kent.
WILLOW	No. Kent Preparatory School. Just outside town. That’s where I’ve seen those bracelets.
GILES	What are you doing?
WILLOW	Pulling up their school newsletter for the last few months, to see if there’s anything about…
GILES	A missing girl…
XANDER	Okay, big fun… who’s next?
TACKLE	Dance, stranger.
BUFFY	Tom?
BUFFY	Okay. Just need to stop spinning for a…
TOM	Get away from her.
RICHARD	I wasn’t doing anything.
TOM	I saw what you were doing.
RICHARD	I just wanted to have a little fun.
TOM	She’s not here for your fun you pervert!
RICHARD	In His Name.
TOM	And that goes for the other one, too.
GILES	Callie Megan Anderson… missing for over a week. No one’s seen her, no one knows what happened to her…
WILLOW	This being Sunnydale and all, I guess we can rule out something good.
GILES	I’m calling Buffy.
WILLOW	No!
GILES	Why not?
WILLOW	Because Buffy… and her mother…
GILES	Are sick. You’re right, we shouldn’t disturb them until we know more.
WILLOW	You mean like if there are others…?
WILLOW	Brittany Oswald, Junior at St. Michael’s, disappeared a year ago… so did Kelly Percell, sophomore at Grant…
GILES	A year ago…
WILLOW	Almost to the day.
GILES	An anniversary… or some other event that has significance for the killer.
WILLOW	Killer? Now there’s a killer? We don’t know there’s a…
GILES	No. But this being Sunnydale and all…
WILLOW	Gulp.
GILES	We need to know where Buffy found that bracelet – and begin a search from there.
WILLOW	Angel.
XANDER	A friend of mine was here –
TACKLE	Party’s over, jerkwater. You know, in that light, with the wig and all, you’re still butt ugly.
XANDER	One day I will have money and power. And on that day… …they’ll still have more.
CORDELIA	Buffy… where are we?
BUFFY	In the basement, far as I can tell.
CORDELIA	What’s happening? What did they…?
BUFFY	They drugged us.
CORDELIA	Why? What are they gonna do?
BUFFY	I don’t know…
CORDELIA	I want to go home.
CALLIE	Ever.
BUFFY	Tom.
CALLIE	He’s the one to watch out for.
TOM	She’s last.
CORDELIA	Last for what? Who’s first?
BUFFY	Three stones… three of us.
CORDELIA	Buffy …
BUFFY	Stay calm. We’ll get out of this.
CORDELIA	Why’d I ever let you talk me into coming here!
ANGEL	She found the bracelet in Miner’s Woods.
GILES	Miner’s Woods, which is…? -- what are you doing?
WILLOW	Oh. Sorry. The reflection thing, that you don’t have. Angel, how do you shave? -- Miner’s Woods. That’s out by the college, right behind… … the Delta Zeta house.
GILES	A fraternity?
ANGEL	Could they be taking these girls?
WILLOW	Buffy -- !
GILES	We don’t know this is concrete, let’s not disturb her until –
WILLOW	-- is there. With Cordelia. They went to a party at the Delta Zeta house!
GILES	She… lied to me?
WILLOW	Well …
ANGEL	Did she… have a date?
WILLOW	Well …
TOM	Machida…
OTHERS	Except that which you give us.
CORDELIA	What are they, some kind of cult?
BUFFY	A psycho-cult.
CORDELIA	You gotta do something.
TOM	It has been a year since our last offerings… a year in which our bounty overflowed… We come before you with fresh offerings… we hope you find them worthy.
CORDELIA	Offerings… he’s talking about us?
CALLIE	You see anyone else chained up in here?
TOM	Accept our offering, dark lord, bless us with your power, Machida!!
OTHERS	Machida !
CORDELIA	What… what’s down there?
TOM	Come forth, let your terrible countenance look upon your servants and their humble offerings! We call you, Machida!
OTHERS	In his name! Machida!
CORDELIA	There’s something down there. And they’re gonna throw us down there with it!
BUFFY	I don’t think so.
CORDELIA	No? Well that’s good, that’s…
BUFFY	I don’t think we go to it, I think it comes to us …
TOM	For he shall rise from the depths and we shall tremble before him. He who is the source of all we inherit and all we possess. MACHIDA!
OTHERS	Machida!
TOM	And if he is pleased with our offerings, then our fortunes shall increase.
OTHERS	Machida, let our fortunes increase.
TOM	And on the tenth day of the tenth month he shall be en-hungered and we shall feed him.
CORDELIA	Feed him. FEED HIM ?!
BUFFY	Hey, Reptile Boy!
TOM	No woman speaks to him!
BUFFY	You don’t want her. She’s all skin and bones. Half hour later you’ll be hungry again. Why don’t you try me –
TOM	Speak again and I’ll cut your throat.
WILLOW	Looks like everyone’s gone.
ANGEL	Hey! XANDER Hey!
XANDER	What are you doing here?
WILLOW	There’s a bunch of girls missing, the Delta Zetas may be involved and Buffy – are you wearing make-up?
XANDER	No. I think Buffy’s still inside somewhere with Cordelia. That’s her car.
GILES	Why are you wearing that…?
XANDER	I found it in their trash. I saw them through the windows, wearing robes, going down to the basement. I was going to use it to sneak in.
GILES	They may be involved in some kind of ritual.
WILLOW	With the missing girls.
ANGEL	With Buffy.
XANDER	Okay, that is the guy you want to party with.
XANDER	Got locked out dumping the trash. Let me in, I don’t want to miss the “you know what…”
TOM	Receive our offering!
XANDER	That’s for the wig, and that’s for the bra…
WILLOW	Some guy’s attacking Buffy with a sword! (beat, realizes: ) Also, there’s a really big snake.
XANDER	… that’s for the make-up and that’s for the last sixteen and a half years!
WILLOW	Guys, Buffy, snake, basement, now!
TOM	You… bitch. I’ll serve you to him in pieces!
BUFFY	Tom…
CORDELIA	Hellllppppp !!!
BUFFY	Back off, wormy!
CORDELIA	You did it, you saved us.
MACHIDA	For a hundred years I have given your forebearers wealth and power. And this is how you repay me. From this day forth you are alone in the world.
BUFFY	I told one lie, I had one drink…
GILES	And you nearly got devoured by a giant demon-snake. I think the words “let that be a lesson” are a tad redundant at this juncture.
BUFFY	Sorry, Giles.
GILES	I am, too. I drive you too hard, because I know what you have to face… from now on no more pushing, no more prodding…
CORDELIA	Thank you, Leslie. Did we forget the extra foam?
CORDELIA	Young men. The only way to go.
XANDER	Says here they’ll all get consecutive life sentences: investigators found bones of the missing girls in a huge cavern beneath the D.Z house… and other bones dating back fifty years…
WILLOW	They didn’t find the snake? Which means we probably will some day. Oh goody.
XANDER	“A surprising number of corporations whose Chairmen and Founders are former Delta Zetas are suffering falling profits, I.R.S raids and suicides in the board room…“ (to Buffy and Willow) Starve a snake, lose a fortune. Boy, the rich really are different.
WILLOW	Have you heard from Angel?
XANDER	Angel, Angel, Angel. Does every conversation always have to come around to that freak?
ANGEL	Buffy.
BUFFY	Angel.
XANDER	Xander …
ANGEL	I hear this place serves coffee. Thought maybe you and I should get some… …sometime. (nothing from Buffy) If you want.
BUFFY	Yeah.
XANDER	To a telephone, in Urdu… now that’s entertainment. Why is she singing?
WILLOW	She’s sad because her lover gave her a dozen gold coins but then the wizard cut open the bag of salt and the dancing minions had no place to put their big Maypole… …fish thing.
XANDER	Uh huh. And why is she singing ?
BUFFY	Her lover? I thought he was her chiropractor.
WILLOW	Because of that thing he did with her feet? No, that was personal.
XANDER	And we thought just ‘cause we didn’t have any money or anywhere to go this’d be a lackluster evening.
WILLOW	Hey, I know – we could go to the Bronze, sneak in our own tea bags and ask for… hot water.
XANDER	Hop off that outlaw train, Will, before you land us all in jail.
BUFFY	I for one am giddy and up. There’s a kind of hush all over Sunnydale, no vampires or demons to slay, I’m here with my friends and— -- where does the water buffalo fit in again?
WILLOW	You dreamed about Angel again?
BUFFY	Third night in a row.
WILLOW	What did he do in the dream?
BUFFY	Stuff.

XANDER	What’s like a relationship?
BUFFY	Nothing I have. Coffee.
XANDER	Huh?
CORDELIA	There’s really no comparison between college men and high school boys – -- I mean look at that.
XANDER	Cor, you datin’ a college guy now?
CORDELIA	Not that it’s any of your business, but I happen to be seeing a Delta Zeta Kappa.
XANDER	Oh, an extra-terrestrial, so that’s how you get a date once you’ve exhausted all the human guys.
CORDEDLIA	You’ll go to college some day, Xander. I just know your pizza delivery career will take you so many exciting places. Ha ha ha ha.
GILES	Just because the paranormal has been more normal and less… para lately, that is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down.
BUFFY	I haven’t let my guard down.
GILES	Oh really? You yawned your way through weapons training last week, you skipped hand to hand entirely – I suppose you’re prepared if some demon springs up behind you and does this!?
BUFFY	And the little scrap of my life that still belongs to me – say from seven to seven oh five in the morning – can I do what I want to then?
GILES	Buffy, you think I don’t know what it’s like to be sixteen?
BUFFY	No, I think you don’t know what it’s like to be sixteen and a girl and a Slayer.
GILES	I may not know precisely –
BUFFY	Or what it’s like to exterminate vampires while you’re having fuzzy feelings towards one.
GILES	You’re still…? That is dicey.

WILLOW	You cut three periods.
XANDER	Yeah, and of course they flew by. Buffy!
WILLOW	Aren’t you s’posed to be doing your homework in the library –
BUFFY	I’m dawdling. With my friends.
RICHARD	Cordelia.
CORDELIA	Hi Richard. Nice car.
CORDELIA	Oh I’d love to –
RICHARD	Who’s your friend?
CORDELIA	Her? She’s not my friend.
TOM	She’s amazing.
CORDELIA	She’s more like a sister, really. We’re that close.
RICHARD	Why don’t you introduce us?
CORDELIA	Come on, Richard and his fraternity brothers want to meet you.
BUFFY	I don’t really want to meet any fraternity –
CORDELIA	And if there was a God, don’tcha’ think He’d keep it that way?
RICHARD	Hi, sweet thing. I’m Richard. And you are?
BUFFY	So not interested.
CORDELIA	She’s such a little comedienne!
RICHARD	What, is she playing hard to get?
TOM	No Richard, I think you’re playing easy to resist. (to Buffy) Feel free to ignore him. I do all the time.
BUFFY	I’m Buffy Summers.
TOM	Nice to meet you. Are you a Senior?
BUFFY	Junior.
TOM	Me too, except I’m a Senior, and in college. So, we have that in common. I major in History.
BUFFY	History stumps me. I have a hard enough time remembering what happened last week.
TOM	Nothing happened last week, don’t worry, I was there.
XANDER	I hate these guys. Whatever they want just falls into their laps. Don’t you hate these guys?
WILLOW	Yeah, with their charmed lives and their movie star good looks and more money than you can count… I’m hating.
TOM	So my friend asked your friend to this party we’re having tomorrow night… (lowers voice) … actually he’s not really my friend – I only joined the fraternity ‘cause my father and grampa were in it before me. It meant a lot to them. I know, I talk too much. Anyway, they’re really dull parties full of really dull people so, uh, how would you like to come and save me from a really dull fate?
BUFFY	I wish I could but… I’m sort of seeing someone.
TOM	Oh. Sure, of course you are. Well, thanks for letting me ramble…
BUFFY	People underestimate the value of a good ramble.
BUFFY	I gotta… nice to meet you
TOM	Same here.
GILES	I’m going to attack you. Word of caution: for your own good, I won’t be pulling any punches.
BUFFY	Please don’t.
BUFFY	Oh… hi. Nice to… blood?
ANGEL	I can smell it.
BUFFY	It’s pretty thin, probably belonged to a girl.
ANGEL	What are you saying, you want to have a date?
BUFFY	No –
ANGEL	You don’t want to have a date.
BUFFY	Who said date? I never said date.
ANGEL	Right, you just want to have coffee or something.
BUFFY	Coffee?
ANGEL	I knew this would happen.
BUFFY	Really? And what do you think is happening?
ANGEL	You’re sixteen years old, I’m two hundred and forty.
BUFFY	I’ve done the math.
ANGEL	You don’t know what you’re doing, you don’t know what you want.
BUFFY	Oh I think I do: I want out of this conversation.
ANGEL	Listen. If we date you and I both know one thing’s going to lead to another. Then what?
BUFFY	Then… whatever, I don’t know, might be nice to find out. But you want to end it before it’s begun. Fine.
ANGEL	It’s a Fairy Tale. Only when I kiss you you don’t wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.
BUFFY	No. When you kiss me I want to die.
BUFFY	I’ll go.
CORDELIA	I’m not going to beg you – please, oh please – you’ll go? Great! We’ll just take my car. Oh Buffy, we’re just like sisters… with really different hair.
MAN	I pledge my life and my death…
RICHARD	To the Delta Zetas and to Machida whom we serve.
MAN	To the Delta Zetas and to Machida whom we serve.
RICHARD	In blood I was baptized, in blood I shall reign, in His Name!
MAN	In blood I was baptized, in blood I shall reign, in His Name!
RICHARD	You are now one of us.
MAN	In His Name!
RICHARD	So what’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?
CALLIE	Please, let me go.
RICHARD	Let you go. Okay, let me think – uhhh, no.
WILLOW	What made you change your mind?
BUFFY	Angel.
WILLOW	He’s going with you? She’s got a date with Angel. Isn’t that exciting?
XANDER	I’m elated.
BUFFY	I’m not going with Angel. I’m going with… ye gods, Cordelia.
WILLOW	Cordelia ? Did I sound a little jealous just then? Cause I’m not really… Cordelia ?
XANDER	Cordelia’s much better for you than Angel.
WILLOW	What happened with Angel?
BUFFY	Nothing. As usual. A whole lot of nothing with Angel.
XANDER	Bummer.
WILLOW	I don’t understand. He likes you. More than likes.
BUFFY	The guy hardly ever says two words to me…
XANDER	Don’t you hate that.
BUFFY	… and he treats me like a child.
XANDER	That bastard!
BUFFY	At least Tom can carry on a conversation.
XANDER	Yeah, Tom – who’s Tom?
WILLOW	The frat guy.
XANDER	Oh, I don’t think so, Buffy, frying pan and the fire, know what I’m saying?
WILLOW	I’ve seen something like that somewhere…
BUFFY	It’s broken in two, I don’t know what the other letters might have spelled… and there’s blood on it.
GILES	I don’t see –
BUFFY	Angel showed up. Said he could smell it.
XANDER	The blood. There’s a guy you want to party with.
GILES	Blood…
WILLOW	Yeah, in Sunnydale, what a surprise.
XANDER	She should probably make the rounds again tonight while we try and figure out who that bracelet belongs to.
GILES	Good idea. She’ll patrol, we’ll reconvene after school –
BUFFY	Hello, “she’s” standing right here. And she’s not available tonight.
GILES	Why not?
XANDER	Buff, this is a little more important than –
BUFFY	--I’ve got a mountain of homework, my mom’s sick and she needs me to take care of her, and I’m starting to feel a little woozy myself.
GILES	Oh, if you’re not feeling…
BUFFY	I’ll make a quick pass early this evening, and another one later on, but for the bulk of the evening…
GILES	You need to be home with your mother.
BUFFY	Well, say it.
XANDER	I’m not going to say it ‘cause –
WILLOW	You lied to Giles.
XANDER	-- she will.
BUFFY	I wasn’t lying. I was protecting him. From information he wouldn’t be able to… digest properly.
XANDER	Like a corn dog.
WILLOW	Like you don’t have a sick mother but you’d rather go to a Fraternity party where there’ll be drinking and older boys and probably an orgy?
XANDER	Enh! Rewind, when did they start having orgies and how come I’m not on the mailing list?
BUFFY	There’s no orgy.
WILLOW	I’ve heard some really wild things go on at the Delta Zeta parties.
BUFFY	Look, six days a week I’m busy saving the world. Once in a great while I want to have some fun. And that’s what I’m going to have tonight… fun.
CORDELIA	This isn’t about fun tonight. It’s about duty: your duty to help me achieve permanent prosperity. Okay, do’s and don’ts. Don’t wear black, silk, chiffon, or spandex – these are my trademarks – don’t do that weird thing to your hair.
BUFFY	What weird…?
CORDELIA	Don’t interrupt. Do be interested if someone should speak to you – may or may not happen – do be polite, do laugh at appropriate intervals – ha ha ha ha – and do lie to your mother about where we’re going: it’s a fraternity, there’ll be drinking.
XANDER	So Cor, are you printing up business cards with your pager number and hours of operation or just going with the halter top tonight?
CORDELIA	Ahh, are we a little envious? Don’t be, you could join a fraternity of rich, powerful men… in the Bizarro world.
BUFFY	You guys want to…
XANDER	Nah, I gotta digest and all.
WILLOW	I can’t believe she lied to Giles. My world is all askew.
XANDER	Buffy lying? Buffy going to frat parties? That’s not askew, that’s cockeyed!
WILLOW	Askew means cockeyed.
XANDER	Oh.
WILLOW	Well, there’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll help Giles –
XANDER	I’m going to the party.
WILLOW	What?
XANDER	I want to keep an eye on Buffy, those frat guys creep me.
WILLOW	You want to protect her. And you want to prove you’re as good as those rich, snotty guys. And maybe catch an orgy.
XANDER	If it’s on early.
CORDELIA	Why do they park so darn close to you? (to Buffy) You up for this?
BUFFY	I don’t know… maybe it isn’t such a good idea—
CORDELIA	Me too, let’s do it!
RICHARD	Welcome, ladies.
CORDELIA	Thank you.
BUFFY	Is there alcohol in this?
RICHARD	Just a smidge.
CORDELIA	C’mon Buffy, it’s just a smidge.
BUFFY	I’ll just…
RICHARD	I understand. When I was your age I wasn’t into grown-up things, either.
CORDELIA	The one with the cherry walnut paneling and the two forty-eight inch televisions on satellite feed? No, why don’t you show me?
CORDELIA	She’s happiest by herself.
BUFFY	Thanks for…
TOM	We’re not all a bunch of drunken louts. Some of us are sober louts. I’m really glad you decided to come. And you’re not.
BUFFY	No. It’s just… I shouldn’t be here.
TOM	Because you’re seeing someone.
BUFFY	No.
TOM	You’re not seeing someone.
BUFFY	Someone’s not seeing me.
TOM	So why shouldn’t you be here?
BUFFY	I have obligations, people I’m responsible to… or for… or with, it’s complex.
TOM	You’re big on responsibility. I like that. But there’s such a thing as too mature. You should relax and enjoy yourself once in a while. You think I’m too mature.
TOM	I talk too much. Have you picked up on that yet? Anyway, the Hulk is gone so you don’t have to dance with me any –
TACKLE	You went to Cold Springs with Donny Hunsinger. Is that his kid brother Stewy?
RICHARD	Stewy’s blond and six four. We got us a crasher.
RICHARD	New Pledge!
TACKLE	New Pledge!
TOM	You okay?
BUFFY	Yeah. I was just… thinking.
WILLOW	Bent.
GILES	Sent.
WILLOW	Rent.
GILES	Lent.
WILLOW	Kent – Kent, that’s it!
GILES	Her boyfriend’s name is Kent.
WILLOW	No. Kent Preparatory School. Just outside town. That’s where I’ve seen those bracelets.
GILES	What are you doing?
WILLOW	Pulling up their school newsletter for the last few months, to see if there’s anything about…
RICHARD	I wasn’t doing anything.
TOM	I saw what you were doing.
RICHARD	I just wanted to have a little fun.
TOM	She’s not here for your fun you pervert!
RICHARD	In His Name.
TOM	And that goes for the other one, too.
GILES	Callie Megan Anderson… missing for over a week. No one’s seen her, no one knows what happened to her…
WILLOW	This being Sunnydale and all, I guess we can rule out something good.
GILES	I’m calling Buffy.
WILLOW	No!
GILES	Why not?
WILLOW	Because Buffy… and her mother…
GILES	Are sick. You’re right, we shouldn’t disturb them until we know more.
WILLOW	You mean like if there are others…?
WILLOW	Brittany Oswald, Junior at St. Michael’s, disappeared a year ago… so did Kelly Percell, sophomore at Grant…
GILES	A year ago…
WILLOW	Almost to the day.
GILES	An anniversary… or some other event that has significance for the killer.
WILLOW	Killer? Now there’s a killer? We don’t know there’s a…
GILES	No. But this being Sunnydale and all…
WILLOW	Gulp.
GILES	We need to know where Buffy found that bracelet – and begin a search from there.
WILLOW	Angel.
XANDER	A friend of mine was here –
TACKLE	Party’s over, jerkwater. You know, in that light, with the wig and all, you’re still butt ugly.
CORDELIA	Buffy… where are we?
BUFFY	In the basement, far as I can tell.
CORDELIA	What’s happening? What did they…?
BUFFY	They drugged us.
CORDELIA	Why? What are they gonna do?
BUFFY	I don’t know…
CORDELIA	I want to go home.
BUFFY	Tom.
TOM	She’s last.
CORDELIA	Last for what? Who’s first?
BUFFY	Three stones… three of us.
CORDELIA	Buffy …
BUFFY	Stay calm. We’ll get out of this.
CORDELIA	Why’d I ever let you talk me into coming here!
GILES	Miner’s Woods, which is…? -- what are you doing?
WILLOW	Oh. Sorry. The reflection thing, that you don’t have. Angel, how do you shave? -- Miner’s Woods. That’s out by the college, right behind… … the Delta Zeta house.
GILES	A fraternity?
WILLOW	Buffy -- !
GILES	We don’t know this is concrete, let’s not disturb her until –
WILLOW	-- is there. With Cordelia. They went to a party at the Delta Zeta house!
GILES	She… lied to me?
WILLOW	Well …
ANGEL	Did she… have a date?
WILLOW	Well …
OTHERS	Except that which you give us.
CORDELIA	What are they, some kind of cult?
BUFFY	A psycho-cult.
CORDELIA	You gotta do something.
TOM	Accept our offering, dark lord, bless us with your power, Machida!!
OTHERS	Machida !
TOM	Come forth, let your terrible countenance look upon your servants and their humble offerings! We call you, Machida!
OTHERS	In his name! Machida!
CORDELIA	There’s something down there. And they’re gonna throw us down there with it!
BUFFY	I don’t think so.
CORDELIA	No? Well that’s good, that’s…
BUFFY	I don’t think we go to it, I think it comes to us …
TOM	For he shall rise from the depths and we shall tremble before him. He who is the source of all we inherit and all we possess. MACHIDA!
OTHERS	Machida!
TOM	And if he is pleased with our offerings, then our fortunes shall increase.
OTHERS	Machida, let our fortunes increase.
TOM	And on the tenth day of the tenth month he shall be en-hungered and we shall feed him.
TOM	No woman speaks to him!
BUFFY	You don’t want her. She’s all skin and bones. Half hour later you’ll be hungry again. Why don’t you try me –
XANDER	What are you doing here?
WILLOW	There’s a bunch of girls missing, the Delta Zetas may be involved and Buffy – are you wearing make-up?
XANDER	No. I think Buffy’s still inside somewhere with Cordelia. That’s her car.
GILES	Why are you wearing that…?
XANDER	I found it in their trash. I saw them through the windows, wearing robes, going down to the basement. I was going to use it to sneak in.
GILES	They may be involved in some kind of ritual.
WILLOW	With the missing girls.
ANGEL	With Buffy.
WILLOW	Some guy’s attacking Buffy with a sword! (beat, realizes: ) Also, there’s a really big snake.
XANDER	… that’s for the make-up and that’s for the last sixteen and a half years!
BUFFY	I told one lie, I had one drink…
GILES	And you nearly got devoured by a giant demon-snake. I think the words “let that be a lesson” are a tad redundant at this juncture.
BUFFY	Sorry, Giles.
GILES	I am, too. I drive you too hard, because I know what you have to face… from now on no more pushing, no more prodding…
XANDER	Says here they’ll all get consecutive life sentences: investigators found bones of the missing girls in a huge cavern beneath the D.Z house… and other bones dating back fifty years…
WILLOW	They didn’t find the snake? Which means we probably will some day. Oh goody.
XANDER	“A surprising number of corporations whose Chairmen and Founders are former Delta Zetas are suffering falling profits, I.R.S raids and suicides in the board room…“ (to Buffy and Willow) Starve a snake, lose a fortune. Boy, the rich really are different.
WILLOW	Have you heard from Angel?
XANDER	Angel, Angel, Angel. Does every conversation always have to come around to that freak?
ANGEL	Buffy.
XANDER	Xander …
ANGEL	I hear this place serves coffee. Thought maybe you and I should get some… …sometime. (nothing from Buffy) If you want.

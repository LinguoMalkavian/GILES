ME	AND I JUST WANT TO BE
GILES	Good morning, Buffy.
WILLOW	Dawn get off to school all right? She made the bus this time?
BUFFY	What? Oh. I think so.
TARA	I left her lunch in the fridge. brown paper bag that said 'Dawn' on it. And also said 'lunch'.
BUFFY	Then she probably took it when she probably got on the bus.
XANDER	"Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!"
ANYA	That's still funny, sweetie.
BUFFY	So, uh... no research? Nothing going on? Monsters, or whatnot?
XANDER	Merciful Zeus.
WILLOW	(looks at Tara) We thought we were the only ones! It was bizarre! GILES Well, I sang, but I have my guitar at the hotel and I often...
TARA	We were talking, and then... It was like...
BUFFY	Like you were in a musical?
GILES	... of course that would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the synchronized dancing from the room service chaps...
ANYA	Xander and I were fighting about Monkey Trouble.
BUFFY	You have monkey trouble?
XANDER	It's a film.
ANYA	It's a corker!
XANDER	Especially the ninth time.
ANYA	And we were arguing and then everything rhymed, and there were harmonies and a dance with coconuts...
XANDER	It was very disturbing.
GILES	What did you sing about?
BUFFY	I, uh... I don't remember. But it seemed perfectly normal.
XANDER	But disturbing. And not the natural order of things and do you think it'll happen again? 'Cause I'm for the natural order of things.
GILES	We should look into it.
WILLOW	Exactly. With the books, and mulling, there could be mulling...
TARA	Do we have any books about this?
XANDER	Well, we've just gotta break it down, look at the factors, before it happens again --
GILES	I'VE GOT A THEORY THAT IT'S A DEMON A DANCING DEMON -- NYEHH, SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT THERE
WILLOW	I'VE GOT A THEORY SOME KID IS DREAMIN' AND WE'RE ALL STUCK INSIDE HIS CRAZY BROADWAY NIGHTMARE
XANDER	I'VE GOT A THEORY WE SHOULD WORK THIS OUT
TARA	I'S GETTING EERIE WHAT'S THIS CHEERY SINGING ALL ABOUT
XANDER	IT COULD BE WITCHES SOME EVIL WITCHES
WITCHES	THEY WERE PERSECUTED WICCA GOOD AND LOVE THE EARTH AND WOMAN POWER I'LL BE OVER HERE
ANYA	I'VE GOT A THEORY IT COULD BE BUNNIES
TARA	I'VE GOT A --
ANYA	BUNNIES AREN'T JUST CUTE LIKE EVERYBODY SUPPOSES THEY GOT THEM HOPPY LEGS AND TWITCHY LITTLE NOSES AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THE CARROTS WHAT DO THEY NEED SUCH GOOD EYESIGHT FOR ANYWAY BUNNIES, BUNNIES IT MUST BE BUNNIES
WILLOW	I'VE GOT A THEORY WE SHOULD WORK THIS FAST
WILLOW	BECAUSE IT CLEARLY COULD GET SERIOUS BEFORE IT'S PASSED
BUFFY	I'VE GOT A THEORY IT DOESN'T MATTER
TOGETHER	WHAT'S IN THIS PLACE THAT WE CAN'T WEATHER APOCALYPSE WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE THE SAME OLD TRIPS WHY SHOULD WE CARE
GROUP	WHAT CAN'T WE DO IF WE GET IN IT WE'LL WORK IT THROUGH WITHIN A MINUTE WE HAVE TO TRY WE KNOW WE'LL PAY THE PRICE IT'S DO OR DIE
BUFFY	HEY, I'VE DIED TWICE
GROUP	WHAT CAN'T WE FACE IF WE'RE TOGETHER
GILES	--WHAT CAN'T WE FACE
GROUP	WHAT'S IN THIS PLACE THAT WE CAN'T WEATHER
GILES	--IF WE'RE TOGETHER
GROUP	THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T FACE
ANYA	EXCEPT FOR BUNNIES...
XANDER	See okay that was disturbing.
WILLOW	I thought it was neat.
BUFFY	So what is it? What's causing it?
GILES	Thought it didn't matter.
BUFFY	Well I'm not exactly quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots but there's definitely something unnatural going on. And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies.
ANYA	Well, is it just us? Is it only happening to us? That would probably mean a spell, or...
MAN	THEY GOT THE MUSTARD OUT
CHORUS	THEY GOT THE MUSTARD OUT!
BUFFY	It's not just us.
DAWN	Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today.
BUFFY	Everybody started singing and dancing?
DAWN	I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
ANYA	Oh my god! Did it sing?
DAWN	So, you guys too, huh?
XANDER	So, what'd you sing about?
DAWN	Math.
TARA	That's right! The, the volume! The text!
GILES	What text?
WILLOW	The volumey... text.
TARA	You know.
WILLOW	The... murnenfurm report.
XANDER	The what now?
TARA	We just have a few volumes at the house that deal with mystical chants, bacchanals... might be relevant.
WILLOW	We could...
GILES	Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at this point, so I'm open to anything.
WILLOW	We'll check it out, we'll give you a call.
TARA	Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open.
TARA	Do we have any books at all at home?
WILLOW	Well, who wants to stay cooped up on a day like this? The sun is shining, there's songs going on, those guys are checking you out...
TARA	What?
WILLOW	The hotness of you, doofus.
TARA	Those boys thought I was hot?
WILLOW	Entirely.
TARA	Oh my god. I'm cured! I want the boys!
WILLOW	Do I have to fight to keep you? 'Cause I'm not large with the butch.
TARA	I'm just not used to that. They were really looking at me.
WILLOW	And you can't imagine what they see in you.
TARA	I know exactly what they see in me. You. I LIVED MY LIFE IN SHADOW NEVER THE SUN ON MY FACE IT DIDN'T SEEM SO SAD, THOUGH I FIGURED THAT WAS MY PLACE

SWELL	LOST IN ECSTASY SPREAD BENEATH MY WILLOW TREE
COMPLETE	YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE
XANDER	I bet they're not even working.
BUFFY	Who now?
XANDER	Willow and Tara. You see the way they were with each other? The get-a- roominess of them. I'll bet they're -- (seeing Dawn) -- singing. They're probably singing right now.
GILES	I'm sure Willow and Tara are making every effort.
XANDER	Oh yeah.
BUFFY	Xander...
DAWN	It's okay, Buffy. I do know about this stuff. Mom and I had the singing talk a year ago. Besides, it is all kind of romantic.
BUFFY	No it's not.
DAWN	Come on, songs, dancing around... what's gonna be wrong with that?
SWEET	That's entertainment...
XANDER	You want some breakfast, baby?
ANYA	You don't have to get to work?
XANDER	I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around, I don't think I could deal. It's a flab thing. So. Waffles?
ANYA	Will you still make me waffles when we're married?
XANDER	No I'll only make them for myself, but by California law you will own half of them.
ANYA	THIS IS THE MAN THAT I PLAN TO ENTANGLE -- ISN'T HE FINE MY CLAIM TO FAME WAS TO MAIM AND TO MANGLE -- VENGEANCE WAS MINE BUT I'M OUT OF THE BIZ THE NAME I MADE I'LL TRADE FOR HIS THE ONLY TROUBLE IS... I'LL NEVER TELL.

XANDER	LIKE SHE THINKS I'M ORDINARY
ANYA	LIKE IT'S ALL JUST TEMPORARY
XANDER	LIKE HER TOES ARE KIND OF HAIRY

XANDER	MY LIPS ARE SEALED
ANYA	I TAKE THE FIFTH
XANDER	NOTHING TO SEE MOVE IT ALONG
ANYA	I'LL NEVER TELL
XANDER	It's a nightmare. It's a plague!
ANYA	It has to be stopped, Rupert --
XANDER	It's like a nightmare about a plague --
XANDER	It was just like, I didn't wanna be saying things but they just kept pouring out of me and they rhymed and they were mean and My eyes are not beady! ANYA I felt like we were being watched, like a wall was missing from our apartment, like there only three walls, no forth wall and My toes are not hairy!
XANDER	Giles, you gotta stop it.
GILES	Well, I am following a few leads, and --
ANYA	Plus, our number was clearly a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit.
XANDER	Work with me, british man. Give me an axe and show me where to point it.
GILES	As ever, it's not quite that simple. But I have learned something quite disturbing...
WOMAN	NO... IT ISN'T RIGHT, IT ISN'T FAIR THERE WAS NO PARKING ANYWHERE I THINK THAT HYDRANT WASN'T THERE
XANDER	As in, burnt up? Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
ANYA	I don't know. One more verse of our little dittie I woulda been lookin' for the gas can...
GILES	Certainly emotions are running high, but as far as I could tell the victims burnt up from the inside. Spontaneously combusted. I just saw the one -- I managed to examine the body while the police were taking witness arias.
XANDER	But we're sure the two things are related? Singing and dancing and burning and dying?
GILES	We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking for leads in the local demon haunts... at least, in theory she is. She doesn't seem to...
XANDER	She's easing back in. We brought her back from an untold hell dimension, remember? Ergo, weirdness. The important thing is that you're there for her.
GILES	I'm helping her as much as I can, but...
SPIKE	The sun sets, and she appears. Come to serenade me?
BUFFY	So you know what's going on.
SPIKE	Well, I've seen some damn funny things, last two days. Six hundred pound Chorago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one'll stay with you. I remain immune, happy to say. Drink?
BUFFY	A world of no. You know anything about what's causing this?
SPIKE	So that's all, then. Just want to pump me for information.
BUFFY	What else would I want to pump you for? I really said that, didn't I?
SPIKE	Yeah, well, I won't bore you with the small talk. Don't know a thing.
BUFFY	What's up? You're all bad moody.
SPIKE	S'nothing. I'm glad you could stop by. It's nothing.
BUFFY	What.
SPIKE	I DIED
FEEL	LIKE IT ISN'T SO BUT WHY YOU COME TO BE WITH ME I THINK I FINALLY KNOW
SCARED	ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU FEEL AND YOU CAN'T TELL THE ONES YOU LOVE YOU KNOW THEY COULDN'T DEAL BUT WHISPER IN A DEAD MAN'S EAR THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT REAL
GREAT	BUT I DON'T WANNA PLAY 'CAUSE BEING NEAR YOU TOUCHES ME MORE THAN I CAN SAY AND SINCE I'M ONLY DEAD TO YOU I'M SAYING STAY AWAY AND LET ME REST IN PEACE
PEACE	LET ME GET SOME SLEEP LET ME TAKE MY LOVE AND BURY IT IN A HOLE SIX FOOT DEEP I CAN LAY MY BODY DOWN BUT I CAN'T FIND MY SWEET RELEASE SO LET ME REST IN PEACE
KNOW	YOU'VE GOT A WILLING SLAVE AND YOU JUST LOVE TO PLAY THE THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT MISBEHAVE (back up in her face) BUT TIL YOU DO I'M TELLING YOU STOP VISITING MY GRAVE AND LET ME REST IN PEACE
SPIKE	I KNOW I SHOULD GO BUT I FOLLOW YOU LIKE A MAN POSSESSED THERE'S A TRAITOR HERE BENEATH MY BREAST AND IT HURTS ME MORE THAN YOU'VE EVER GUESSED IF MY HEART COULD BEAT IT WOULD BREAK MY CHEST BUT I CAN SEE YOU'RE UNIMPRESSED SO LEAVE ME BE LET ME REST IN PEACE
SLEEP	LET ME TAKE MY LOVE AND BURY IT IN A HOLE SIX FOOT DEEP I CAN LAY MY BODY DOWN BUT I CAN'T FIND MY SWEET RELEASE
SPIKE	SO LET ME REST IN PEACE WHY WON'T YOU LET ME REST IN PEACE
SPIKE	So... you're not staying, then?
TARA	Lotta homework?
DAWN	Math. It seemed so cool when we were singing about it...
TARA	Well, Willow said they got a lead on this whole musical extravaganza evil. This Demon that can be summoned, some Lord of the Dance -- but not the scary one. Just a demon.
DAWN	Do they know who summoned it?
TARA	They don't even know its name yet. But Willow'll find out. She's the brainy type.
DAWN	I'm glad you guys made up.
TARA	What?
DAWN	That whole fight you guys had about magic and stuff. It gives me belly rumblin's when you guys fight.
TARA	Dawn, we never talked about...
DAWN	It's okay, I mean I can handle it. It's just, you guys are so great together, I just hate it when -- but that was like the only real fight I've seen you guys have anyway. But I'm still glad it's over.
TARA	Dawn, I... there's something I need at the shop. Will you be okay for a little while?
DAWN	Yes, the fifteen year old can spend half an hour alone in her locked house.
TARA	I won't be long...
DAWN	DOES ANYBODY EVEN NOTICE
SWEET	WHY'D YOU RUN AWAY DON'T YOU LIKE MY STYLE?
SWEET	WHY DON'T YOU COME AND PLAY I GUARANTEE A GREAT BIG SMILE
SWEET	I COME FROM THE IMAGINATION AND I'M HERE STRICTLY BY YOUR INVOCATION (unraveling a parchment that looks like an invitation) SO WHAT'D YOU SAY WHY DON'T WE DANCE A WHILE
SWEET	I'M THE HEART OF SWING I'M THE TWIST AND SHOUT WHEN YOU GOTTA SING WHEN YOU GOTTA LET IT OUT YOU CALL ME AND I COME A-RUNNIN' I TURN THE MUSIC ON -- I BRING THE FUN IN NOW WE'RE PARTYING -- THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL, GIRL I KNOW JUST WHAT YOU FEEL, GIRL
DAWN	So, you're, like... a good demon?
SWEET	WHEN THESE MELODIES THEY GO ON TOO LONG ALL THAT ENERGY WELL IT COMES ON WAY TOO STRONG ALL THOSE HEARTS LAID OPEN - THAT MUST STING PLUS SOME CUSTOMERS JUST START COMBUSTING
SWEET	THAT'S THE PENALTY WHEN LIFE IS BUT A SONG
SWEET	YOU BROUGHT ME DOWN AND DOOMED THIS TOWN SO WHEN WE BLOW THIS SCENE BACK WE'LL GO TO MY KINGDOM BELOW AND YOU WILL BE MY QUEEN
SWEET	'CAUSE I KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL, GIRL
DAWN	NO YOU SEE YOU AND ME WOULDN'T BE VERY REGAL
SWEET	AND I MAKE IT REAL, GIRL
DAWN	WHAT I MEAN I'M FIFTEEN SO THIS 'QUEEN' THING'S ILLEGAL
SWEET	I CAN BRING WHOLE CITIES TO RUIN AND STILL HAVE TIME TO GET A SOFT SHOE IN
DAWN	NO THAT'S GREAT BUT I'M LATE AND I'D HATE TO DELAY HER
SWEET	SOMETHING'S COOKING - I'M AT THE GRIDDLE I BOUGHT NERO HIS VERY FIRST FIDDLE
DAWN	SHE'LL GET PISSED IF I'M MISSED SEE, MY SISTER'S THE SLAYER
SWEET	The Slayer?
DAWN	Yuh huh.
SWEET	Find her. Tell her... tell her everything. Just get her here. want to see the Slayer burn. NOW WE'RE PARTYING THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
GILES	Good. Good.
BUFFY	Am I supposed to bow now, or... have honor or something?
GILES	It may seem hokey, but we need to work on precision and concentration as much as power. We're still not sure what we're facing.
BUFFY	You'll figure it out. I'm just worried this whole session is going to turn into a training montage from an eighties movie.
GILES	Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords we'll just lie down until they go away. Anyway, I don't think we need to work too much on strength.
BUFFY	Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.
GILES	Have you, uh, spoken with Dawn at all about the incident at Halloween?
BUFFY	I thought you took care of that.
GILES	Right.
BUFFY	What would I do without you.
GILES	YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THE WORLD OUTSIDE YOU KEEP PRETENDING, BUT YOU JUST CAN'T HIDE I KNOW I SAID THAT I'D BE STANDING BY YOUR SIDE BUT I...
ALL	UPHILL AND YOU CAN MEET IT, BUT YOU NEVER WILL AND I'M THE REASON THAT YOU'RE STANDING STILL BUT I....
WORDS	TO LEAD YOU THROUGH THIS LAND WISH I COULD PLAY THE FATHER AND TAKE YOU BY THE HAND WISH I COULD STAY BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND I'M STANDING IN THE WAY
AT	ALL 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I'M HERE TO TAKE THAT CALL SO YOU JUST LIE THERE, WHEN YOU SHOULD BE STANDING TALL BUT I... I WISH I COULD LAY YOUR ARMS DOWN AND LET YOU REST AT LAST WISH I COULD SLAY YOUR DEMONS BUT NOW THAT TIME HAS PASSED WISH I COULD STAY WE START WITH STANDING FAST BUT I'M STANDING IN THE WAY I'M JUST STANDING IN THE WAY
BUFFY	Did you say something?
ANYA	Hey.
TARA	I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL GOD, HOW CAN THIS BE PLAYING WITH MY MEMORY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL WILLOW, DON'T YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NOTHING LEFT OF ME
TARA	YOU MADE ME BELIEVE GILES BELIEVE ME I DON'T WANNA GO
GILES	AND IT'LL GRIEVE ME 'CAUSE I LOVE YOU SO BUT WE BOTH KNOW
TARA	WISH I COULD TRUST THAT IT WAS JUST THIS ONCE BUT I MUST DO WHAT I MUST I CAN'T ADJUST TO THIS DISGUST WE'RE DONE AND I JUST GILES WISH I COULD SAY THE RIGHT WORDS TO LEAD YOU THROUGH THIS LAND WISH I COULD PLAY THE FATHER AND TAKE YOU BY THE HAND
GILES	WISH I COULD STAY WISH I COULD STAY WISH I COULD STAY WISH I COULD STAY
SPIKE	Lookie lookie what I found.
WILLOW	Tara?
TARA	Is this the demon guy?
SPIKE	Works for him. Has a nice little story for the Slayer, don't you?
HENCHMAN	My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she summoned him and at midnight he's gonna take her to the underworld to be his Queen.
GILES	What does he want?
HENCHMAN	Her. Plus chaos and insanity and people burning up, but that's more big picture stuff.
SPIKE	If that's all you've got to say, then --
BUFFY	So Dawn's in trouble. It must be Tuesday.
TARA	I just left her for a few minutes...
BUFFY	It's not your fault. Giles, what's the plan?
XANDER	Plan, shman, let's mount up!
GILES	No.
ANYA	Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature but I've seen some of these underworld child- bride deals and they never end well. Maybe once.
WILLOW	We're not just gonna stay here...
GILES	Yes we are. Buffy's going alone.
SPIKE	Don't be a stupid git, there's no --
GILES	When I want your opinion, Spike, I... will never want your opinion.
WILLOW	A little confusion spell would --
TARA	No.
SPIKE	Forget them, Slayer, I got your back.
BUFFY	I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Isn't that what you sang?
XANDER	Spikey sang a widdle song?
ANYA	Would you say it was a breakaway pop hit, or more of a book number?
XANDER	Let it go, sweetie.
SPIKE	Fine. I hope you dance til you burn. You and the little bit.
BUFFY	You're really not coming.
GILES	It's up to you, Buffy.
BUFFY	What do you expect me to do?
GILES	Your best.
BUFFY	I TOUCH THE FIRE AND IT FREEZES ME I LOOK INTO IT AND IT'S BLACK WHY CAN'T I FEEL MY SKIN SHOULD CRACK AND PEEL I WANT THE FIRE BACK
ME	TO MAKE MY WAY ACROSS THE FLAME TO SAVE THE DAY OR MAYBE MELT AWAY I GUESS IT'S ALL THE SAME SO I WILL WALK THROUGH THE FIRE 'CAUSE WHERE ELSE CAN I TURN I WILL WALK THROUGH THE FIRE AND LET IT --
SPIKE	THE TORCH I BEAR IS SCORCHING ME AND BUFFY'S LAUGHING I'VE NO DOUBT I HOPE SHE FRIES I'M FREE IF THAT BITCH DIES I'D BETTER HELP HER OUT
SWEET	SHE'S GETTING WARM -- IT BUILDS IN HER SHE MAY JUST GO UP IN A FLASH AND WHEN SHE'S DONE HER FRIENDS CAN HAVE THE FUN OF SIFTING THROUGH THE ASH
SWEET	CAUSE SHE IS DRAWN TO THE FIRE SOME PEOPLE NEVER LEARN SPIKE 'CAUSE SHE IS DRAWN TO THE FIRE SHE WILL NEVER LEARN
SPIKE	AND SHE WILL WALK THROUGH THE FIRE AND LET IT
GILES	WILL THIS DO A THING TO CHANGE HER AM I LEAVING DAWN IN DANGER IS MY SLAYER TOO FAR GONE TO CARE
XANDER	WHAT IF BUFFY CAN'T DEFEAT IT

GROUP	WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH IT'S WHAT WE'RE ALWAYS HERE TO DO SO WE WILL WALK THROUGH THE FIRE
BUFFY	SO ONE BY ONE THEY TURN FROM ME I GUESS MY FRIENDS CAN'T FACE THE COLD
TARA	WHAT CAN'T WE FACE IF WE'RE TOGETHER
BUFFY	BUT WHY I FROZE NOT ONE AMONG THEM KNOWS AND NEVER CAN BE TOLD
ANYA	SHE CAME FROM THE GRAVE MUCH GRAVER
SPIKE	FIRST I'LL KILL HER THEN I'LL SAVE HER
SWEET	SO ONE BY ONE THEY COME TO ME THE DISTANT REDNESS AS THEIR GUIDE BUT WHAT THEY'LL FIND AIN'T WHAT THEY HAVE IN MIND IT'S WHAT THEY HAVE INSIDE TARA EVERYTHING IS TURNING OUT SO DARK BUFFY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS WALKING THROUGH THE PART
SPIKE	NO I'LL SAVE HER THEN I'LL KILL HER
SWEET	SHE WILL COME TO ME
WILLOW	I THINK THIS LINE'S MOSTLY FILLER
GILES	WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO STRIKE A SPARK

BUFFY	How are you with death scenes?
SWEET	I got a hundred.
BUFFY	Well, I aughta know what to call you if you're gonna be my brother in law.
DAWN	Buffy I swear I didn't do it.
BUFFY	Don't worry, you're not going anywhere. I am.
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	What do you want a little kid for? Deal's this: I can't kill you, you take me to hellsville in her place.
SWEET	What if I kill you?
BUFFY	Trust me. It won't help.
SWEET	That's gloomy.
BUFFY	That's life.
SWEET	Come now, is that really what you feel? Isn't life a miraculous thing?
BUFFY	I think you already know... LIFE'S A SHOW AND WE ALL PLAY OUR PARTS AND WHEN THE MUSIC STARTS WE OPEN UP OUR HEARTS IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SOMETHING'S COME OUT WRONG WE'LL SING A HAPPY SONG
HOPE	EVERY DAY'S A GIFT WISHES CAN COME TRUE WHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK SO HARD ALL DAY TO BE LIKE OTHER GIRLS TO FIT INTO THIS GLITTERING WORLD
GILES	She needs backup. Tara. Anya.
BUFFY	DON'T GIVE ME SONGS DON'T GIVE ME SONGS GIVE ME SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT I NEED SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT
TO	REHEARSE AND EVERY SINGLE VERSE CAN MAKE IT THAT MUCH WORSE STILL MY FRIENDS DON'T KNOW WHY I IGNORE THE MILLION THINGS OR MORE I SHOULD BE DANCING FOR ALL THE JOYS LIFE SENDS FAMILY AND FRIENDS ALL THE TWISTS AND BENDS KNOWING THAT IT ENDS WELL THAT DEPENDS ON IF THEY LET YOU GO ON IF THEY KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'VE BOWED YOU LEAVE THE CROWD
PAIN	NO FEAR, NO DOUBT TIL THEY PULLED ME OUT OF HEAVEN SO THAT'S MY REFRAIN I LIVE IN HELL 'CAUSE I WAS EXPELLED FROM HEAVEN I THINK I WAS IN HEAVEN
SPIKE	LIFE'S NOT A SONG LIFE ISN'T BLISS LIFE IS JUST THIS: IT'S LIVING YOU'LL GET ALONG THE PAIN THAT YOU FEEL YOU ONLY CAN HEAL BY LIVING YOU HAVE TO GO ON LIVING SO ONE OF US IS LIVING
DAWN	The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
SWEET	Now that was a showstopper. Not quite the fireworks I was looking for --
WILLOW	Get out of here.
SWEET	Hmm, I smell power. I guess the little missus and I should be on our way.
GILES	That's never gonna happen.
SWEET	I don't make the rules; she summoned me.
DAWN	I so did not! He keeps saying that!
SWEET	You've got my talisman on, sweet thing.
DAWN	Oh! But -- no! I just -- this at the Magic Box... on the floor, and I was cleaning and I forgot to... But I didn't summon anything.
SWEET	Well now, that's a twist.
GILES	If it was at the shop, that means one of us had to...
ANYA	Xander?
XANDER	I didn't know what was gonna happen! I just heard, you know, revelries and song and... I wanted to be sure we'd work out. Get a happy ending.
SWEET	And I think it worked out just fine.
XANDER	Does this mean I have to... be your queen?
SWEET	It's tempting. But I think we'll waive that clause just this once. Big smiles, everyone: you beat the bad guy! WHAT A LOT OF FUN YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN SWELL AND THERE'S NOT A ONE WHO CAN SAY THIS ENDED WELL ALL THOSE SECRETS YOU BEEN CONCEALING SAY YOU'RE HAPPY NOW -- ONCE MORE WITH FEELING WELL I GOTTA RUN SEE YOU ALL IN HELL

BUFFY	Spike, I...
SPIKE	Look, you don't have to say anything. We both know I can talk enough for both of --
BUFFY	I TOUCH THE FIRE AND IT FREEZES ME I LOOK INTO IT AND IT'S BLACK THIS ISN'T REAL BUT I JUST WANT TO FEEL... SPIKE I DIED SO MANY YEARS AGO BUT YOU CAN MAKE ME FEEL...

GILES	Good morning, Buffy.
WILLOW	Dawn get off to school all right? She made the bus this time?
BUFFY	What? Oh. I think so.
TARA	I left her lunch in the fridge. brown paper bag that said 'Dawn' on it. And also said 'lunch'.
BUFFY	Then she probably took it when she probably got on the bus.
XANDER	"Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!"
ANYA	That's still funny, sweetie.
TARA	We were talking, and then... It was like...
BUFFY	Like you were in a musical?
GILES	... of course that would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the synchronized dancing from the room service chaps...
ANYA	Xander and I were fighting about Monkey Trouble.
BUFFY	You have monkey trouble?
XANDER	It's a film.
ANYA	It's a corker!
XANDER	Especially the ninth time.
ANYA	And we were arguing and then everything rhymed, and there were harmonies and a dance with coconuts...
XANDER	It was very disturbing.
GILES	What did you sing about?
BUFFY	I, uh... I don't remember. But it seemed perfectly normal.
XANDER	But disturbing. And not the natural order of things and do you think it'll happen again? 'Cause I'm for the natural order of things.
GILES	We should look into it.
WILLOW	Exactly. With the books, and mulling, there could be mulling...
TARA	Do we have any books about this?
XANDER	Well, we've just gotta break it down, look at the factors, before it happens again --
GILES	I'VE GOT A THEORY THAT IT'S A DEMON A DANCING DEMON -- NYEHH, SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT THERE
WILLOW	I'VE GOT A THEORY SOME KID IS DREAMIN' AND WE'RE ALL STUCK INSIDE HIS CRAZY BROADWAY NIGHTMARE
XANDER	I'VE GOT A THEORY WE SHOULD WORK THIS OUT
TARA	I'S GETTING EERIE WHAT'S THIS CHEERY SINGING ALL ABOUT
WITCHES	THEY WERE PERSECUTED WICCA GOOD AND LOVE THE EARTH AND WOMAN POWER I'LL BE OVER HERE
ANYA	I'VE GOT A THEORY IT COULD BE BUNNIES
WILLOW	I'VE GOT A THEORY WE SHOULD WORK THIS FAST
WILLOW	BECAUSE IT CLEARLY COULD GET SERIOUS BEFORE IT'S PASSED
BUFFY	I'VE GOT A THEORY IT DOESN'T MATTER
GROUP	WHAT CAN'T WE DO IF WE GET IN IT WE'LL WORK IT THROUGH WITHIN A MINUTE WE HAVE TO TRY WE KNOW WE'LL PAY THE PRICE IT'S DO OR DIE
BUFFY	HEY, I'VE DIED TWICE
GROUP	WHAT CAN'T WE FACE IF WE'RE TOGETHER
GILES	--WHAT CAN'T WE FACE
GROUP	WHAT'S IN THIS PLACE THAT WE CAN'T WEATHER
GILES	--IF WE'RE TOGETHER
GROUP	THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T FACE
ANYA	EXCEPT FOR BUNNIES...
XANDER	See okay that was disturbing.
WILLOW	I thought it was neat.
BUFFY	So what is it? What's causing it?
GILES	Thought it didn't matter.
BUFFY	Well I'm not exactly quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots but there's definitely something unnatural going on. And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies.
ANYA	Well, is it just us? Is it only happening to us? That would probably mean a spell, or...
DAWN	Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today.
BUFFY	Everybody started singing and dancing?
DAWN	I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
ANYA	Oh my god! Did it sing?
XANDER	So, what'd you sing about?
DAWN	Math.
TARA	That's right! The, the volume! The text!
GILES	What text?
WILLOW	The volumey... text.
TARA	You know.
WILLOW	The... murnenfurm report.
XANDER	The what now?
TARA	We just have a few volumes at the house that deal with mystical chants, bacchanals... might be relevant.
WILLOW	We could...
GILES	Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at this point, so I'm open to anything.
WILLOW	We'll check it out, we'll give you a call.
TARA	Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open.
TARA	Do we have any books at all at home?
WILLOW	Well, who wants to stay cooped up on a day like this? The sun is shining, there's songs going on, those guys are checking you out...
TARA	What?
WILLOW	The hotness of you, doofus.
TARA	Those boys thought I was hot?
WILLOW	Entirely.
TARA	Oh my god. I'm cured! I want the boys!
WILLOW	Do I have to fight to keep you? 'Cause I'm not large with the butch.
TARA	I'm just not used to that. They were really looking at me.
WILLOW	And you can't imagine what they see in you.
TARA	I know exactly what they see in me. You. I LIVED MY LIFE IN SHADOW NEVER THE SUN ON MY FACE IT DIDN'T SEEM SO SAD, THOUGH I FIGURED THAT WAS MY PLACE
XANDER	I bet they're not even working.
BUFFY	Who now?
XANDER	Willow and Tara. You see the way they were with each other? The get-a- roominess of them. I'll bet they're -- (seeing Dawn) -- singing. They're probably singing right now.
GILES	I'm sure Willow and Tara are making every effort.
XANDER	Oh yeah.
BUFFY	Xander...
DAWN	It's okay, Buffy. I do know about this stuff. Mom and I had the singing talk a year ago. Besides, it is all kind of romantic.
BUFFY	No it's not.
DAWN	Come on, songs, dancing around... what's gonna be wrong with that?
XANDER	You want some breakfast, baby?
ANYA	You don't have to get to work?
XANDER	I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around, I don't think I could deal. It's a flab thing. So. Waffles?
ANYA	Will you still make me waffles when we're married?
XANDER	No I'll only make them for myself, but by California law you will own half of them.
GO	THE LOVE WE'VE KNOWN CAN ONLY GROW THERE'S JUST ONE THING THAT -- NO I'LL NEVER TELL
ANYA	'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL
ANYA	HE SNORES
XANDER	SHE WHEEZES
ANYA	SAY 'HOUSEWORK' AND HE FREEZES
XANDER	SHE EATS THESE SKEEZY CHEESES THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE
ANYA	I TALK -- HE BREEZES
XANDER	SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT 'PLEASE' IS
ANYA	HIS PENIS GOT DISEASES FROM A CHUMASH TRIBE
ANYA	THE VIBE GETS KIND OF SCARY
XANDER	LIKE SHE THINKS I'M ORDINARY
ANYA	LIKE IT'S ALL JUST TEMPORARY
XANDER	LIKE HER TOES ARE KIND OF HAIRY
ANYA	BUT IT'S ALL VERY WELL 'CAUSE GOD KNOWS I'LL NEVER TELL
ANYA	WHEN THINGS GET ROUGH HE JUST HIDES BEHIND HIS BUFFY NOW LOOK -- HE'S GETTING HUFFY 'CAUSE HE KNOWS THAT I KNOW
XANDER	SHE CLINGS -- SHE'S NEEDY SHE'S ALSO REALLY GREEDY SHE NEVER --
ANYA	--HIS EYES ARE BEADY!
XANDER	THIS IS MY VERSE, HELLO SHE --
ANYA	YOU KNOW
XANDER	YOU'RE QUITE THE CHARMER
ANYA	MY KNIGHT IN ARMOR
XANDER	YOU'RE THE CUTEST OF THE SCOOBIES WITH YOUR LIPS AS RED AS RUBIES AND YOUR FIRM YET SUPPLE -- TIGHT EMBRACE...
ANYA	HE'S SWELL
XANDER	SHE'S SWELLER
ANYA	HE'LL ALWAYS BE MY FELLER
XANDER	THAT'S WHY I'LL NEVER TELL HER THAT I'M PETRIFIED
ANYA	I'VE READ THIS TALE THERE'S WEDDING THEN BETRAYAL I KNOW THAT COME THE DAY I'LL WANT TO RUN AND HIDE
ANYA	I LIED I SAID IT'S EASY I'VE TRIED BUT THERE'S THESE FEARS I CAN'T QUELL
XANDER	IS SHE LOOKING FOR A POT OF GOLD
ANYA	WILL I LOOK GOOD WHEN I'VE GOTTEN OLD
XANDER	WILL OUR LIVES BECOME TOO STRESSFUL IF I'M NEVER THAT SUCCESSFUL
ANYA	WHEN I GET SO WORN AND WRINKLY THAT I LOOK LIKE DAVID BRINKLEY
XANDER	AM I CRAZY
ANYA	AM I DREAMIN'
XANDER	AM I MARRYING A DEMON
ANYA	WE COULD REALLY RAISE THE BEAM IN MAKING MARRIAGE A HELL SO THANK GOD I'LL NEVER TELL I SWEAR THAT I'LL NEVER TELL
XANDER	MY LIPS ARE SEALED
ANYA	I TAKE THE FIFTH
XANDER	NOTHING TO SEE MOVE IT ALONG
ANYA	I'LL NEVER TELL
XANDER	It's a nightmare. It's a plague!
ANYA	It has to be stopped, Rupert --
XANDER	It's like a nightmare about a plague --
XANDER	Giles, you gotta stop it.
GILES	Well, I am following a few leads, and --
ANYA	Plus, our number was clearly a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit.
XANDER	Work with me, british man. Give me an axe and show me where to point it.
GILES	As ever, it's not quite that simple. But I have learned something quite disturbing...
XANDER	As in, burnt up? Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
ANYA	I don't know. One more verse of our little dittie I woulda been lookin' for the gas can...
GILES	Certainly emotions are running high, but as far as I could tell the victims burnt up from the inside. Spontaneously combusted. I just saw the one -- I managed to examine the body while the police were taking witness arias.
XANDER	But we're sure the two things are related? Singing and dancing and burning and dying?
GILES	We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking for leads in the local demon haunts... at least, in theory she is. She doesn't seem to...
XANDER	She's easing back in. We brought her back from an untold hell dimension, remember? Ergo, weirdness. The important thing is that you're there for her.
SPIKE	The sun sets, and she appears. Come to serenade me?
BUFFY	So you know what's going on.
SPIKE	Well, I've seen some damn funny things, last two days. Six hundred pound Chorago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one'll stay with you. I remain immune, happy to say. Drink?
BUFFY	A world of no. You know anything about what's causing this?
SPIKE	So that's all, then. Just want to pump me for information.
BUFFY	What else would I want to pump you for? I really said that, didn't I?
SPIKE	Yeah, well, I won't bore you with the small talk. Don't know a thing.
BUFFY	What's up? You're all bad moody.
SPIKE	S'nothing. I'm glad you could stop by. It's nothing.
BUFFY	What.
SPIKE	I DIED
TARA	Lotta homework?
DAWN	Math. It seemed so cool when we were singing about it...
TARA	Well, Willow said they got a lead on this whole musical extravaganza evil. This Demon that can be summoned, some Lord of the Dance -- but not the scary one. Just a demon.
DAWN	Do they know who summoned it?
TARA	They don't even know its name yet. But Willow'll find out. She's the brainy type.
DAWN	I'm glad you guys made up.
TARA	What?
DAWN	That whole fight you guys had about magic and stuff. It gives me belly rumblin's when you guys fight.
TARA	Dawn, we never talked about...
DAWN	It's okay, I mean I can handle it. It's just, you guys are so great together, I just hate it when -- but that was like the only real fight I've seen you guys have anyway. But I'm still glad it's over.
TARA	Dawn, I... there's something I need at the shop. Will you be okay for a little while?
DAWN	Yes, the fifteen year old can spend half an hour alone in her locked house.
TARA	I won't be long...
SWEET	WHEN THESE MELODIES THEY GO ON TOO LONG ALL THAT ENERGY WELL IT COMES ON WAY TOO STRONG ALL THOSE HEARTS LAID OPEN - THAT MUST STING PLUS SOME CUSTOMERS JUST START COMBUSTING
SWEET	'CAUSE I KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL, GIRL
DAWN	NO YOU SEE YOU AND ME WOULDN'T BE VERY REGAL
SWEET	AND I MAKE IT REAL, GIRL
DAWN	WHAT I MEAN I'M FIFTEEN SO THIS 'QUEEN' THING'S ILLEGAL
SWEET	I CAN BRING WHOLE CITIES TO RUIN AND STILL HAVE TIME TO GET A SOFT SHOE IN
DAWN	NO THAT'S GREAT BUT I'M LATE AND I'D HATE TO DELAY HER
SWEET	SOMETHING'S COOKING - I'M AT THE GRIDDLE I BOUGHT NERO HIS VERY FIRST FIDDLE
DAWN	SHE'LL GET PISSED IF I'M MISSED SEE, MY SISTER'S THE SLAYER
SWEET	The Slayer?
DAWN	Yuh huh.
GILES	Good. Good.
BUFFY	Am I supposed to bow now, or... have honor or something?
GILES	It may seem hokey, but we need to work on precision and concentration as much as power. We're still not sure what we're facing.
BUFFY	You'll figure it out. I'm just worried this whole session is going to turn into a training montage from an eighties movie.
GILES	Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords we'll just lie down until they go away. Anyway, I don't think we need to work too much on strength.
BUFFY	Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.
GILES	Have you, uh, spoken with Dawn at all about the incident at Halloween?
BUFFY	I thought you took care of that.
GILES	Right.
BUFFY	What would I do without you.
SPIKE	Lookie lookie what I found.
WILLOW	Tara?
TARA	Is this the demon guy?
SPIKE	Works for him. Has a nice little story for the Slayer, don't you?
HENCHMAN	My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she summoned him and at midnight he's gonna take her to the underworld to be his Queen.
GILES	What does he want?
HENCHMAN	Her. Plus chaos and insanity and people burning up, but that's more big picture stuff.
BUFFY	So Dawn's in trouble. It must be Tuesday.
TARA	I just left her for a few minutes...
BUFFY	It's not your fault. Giles, what's the plan?
XANDER	Plan, shman, let's mount up!
GILES	No.
ANYA	Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature but I've seen some of these underworld child- bride deals and they never end well. Maybe once.
WILLOW	We're not just gonna stay here...
GILES	Yes we are. Buffy's going alone.
SPIKE	Don't be a stupid git, there's no --
GILES	When I want your opinion, Spike, I... will never want your opinion.
WILLOW	A little confusion spell would --
TARA	No.
SPIKE	Forget them, Slayer, I got your back.
BUFFY	I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Isn't that what you sang?
XANDER	Spikey sang a widdle song?
ANYA	Would you say it was a breakaway pop hit, or more of a book number?
XANDER	Let it go, sweetie.
SPIKE	Fine. I hope you dance til you burn. You and the little bit.
BUFFY	You're really not coming.
GILES	It's up to you, Buffy.
BUFFY	What do you expect me to do?
GILES	Your best.
GILES	WILL THIS DO A THING TO CHANGE HER AM I LEAVING DAWN IN DANGER IS MY SLAYER TOO FAR GONE TO CARE
XANDER	WHAT IF BUFFY CAN'T DEFEAT IT
ANYA	BEADY-EYES IS RIGHT -- WE'RE NEEDED OR WE COULD JUST SIT AROUND AND GLARE
BUFFY	SO ONE BY ONE THEY TURN FROM ME I GUESS MY FRIENDS CAN'T FACE THE COLD
TARA	WHAT CAN'T WE FACE IF WE'RE TOGETHER
BUFFY	BUT WHY I FROZE NOT ONE AMONG THEM KNOWS AND NEVER CAN BE TOLD
ANYA	SHE CAME FROM THE GRAVE MUCH GRAVER
SPIKE	FIRST I'LL KILL HER THEN I'LL SAVE HER
SWEET	SO ONE BY ONE THEY COME TO ME THE DISTANT REDNESS AS THEIR GUIDE BUT WHAT THEY'LL FIND AIN'T WHAT THEY HAVE IN MIND IT'S WHAT THEY HAVE INSIDE TARA EVERYTHING IS TURNING OUT SO DARK BUFFY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS WALKING THROUGH THE PART
SPIKE	NO I'LL SAVE HER THEN I'LL KILL HER
WILLOW	I THINK THIS LINE'S MOSTLY FILLER
GILES	WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO STRIKE A SPARK
BUFFY	THESE ENDLESS DAYS ARE FINALLY ENDING IN A BLAZE
SWEET	I love a good entrance.
BUFFY	How are you with death scenes?
SWEET	I got a hundred.
BUFFY	Well, I aughta know what to call you if you're gonna be my brother in law.
DAWN	Buffy I swear I didn't do it.
BUFFY	Don't worry, you're not going anywhere. I am.
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	What do you want a little kid for? Deal's this: I can't kill you, you take me to hellsville in her place.
SWEET	What if I kill you?
BUFFY	Trust me. It won't help.
SWEET	That's gloomy.
BUFFY	That's life.
SWEET	Come now, is that really what you feel? Isn't life a miraculous thing?
BUFFY	I think you already know... LIFE'S A SHOW AND WE ALL PLAY OUR PARTS AND WHEN THE MUSIC STARTS WE OPEN UP OUR HEARTS IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SOMETHING'S COME OUT WRONG WE'LL SING A HAPPY SONG
SPIKE	LIFE'S NOT A SONG LIFE ISN'T BLISS LIFE IS JUST THIS: IT'S LIVING YOU'LL GET ALONG THE PAIN THAT YOU FEEL YOU ONLY CAN HEAL BY LIVING YOU HAVE TO GO ON LIVING SO ONE OF US IS LIVING
DAWN	The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
SWEET	Now that was a showstopper. Not quite the fireworks I was looking for --
WILLOW	Get out of here.
SWEET	Hmm, I smell power. I guess the little missus and I should be on our way.
GILES	That's never gonna happen.
SWEET	I don't make the rules; she summoned me.
DAWN	I so did not! He keeps saying that!
SWEET	You've got my talisman on, sweet thing.
DAWN	Oh! But -- no! I just -- this at the Magic Box... on the floor, and I was cleaning and I forgot to... But I didn't summon anything.
SWEET	Well now, that's a twist.
GILES	If it was at the shop, that means one of us had to...
ANYA	Xander?
XANDER	I didn't know what was gonna happen! I just heard, you know, revelries and song and... I wanted to be sure we'd work out. Get a happy ending.
SWEET	And I think it worked out just fine.
XANDER	Does this mean I have to... be your queen?
SWEET	It's tempting. But I think we'll waive that clause just this once. Big smiles, everyone: you beat the bad guy! WHAT A LOT OF FUN YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN SWELL AND THERE'S NOT A ONE WHO CAN SAY THIS ENDED WELL ALL THOSE SECRETS YOU BEEN CONCEALING SAY YOU'RE HAPPY NOW -- ONCE MORE WITH FEELING WELL I GOTTA RUN SEE YOU ALL IN HELL
SPIKE	WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
GILES	THE BATTLE'S DONE AND WE KIND OF WON
GILES	SO WE SOUND OUR VICT'RY CHEER WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
ANYA	WHY IS THE PATH UNCLEAR WHEN WE KNOW HOME IS NEAR
HAND	BUT WE'LL WALK ALONE IN FEAR TELL ME, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
SPIKE	You should go back in. Finish the big group sing, get your KoombaYa- Ya's out.
BUFFY	I don't want to...
SPIKE	Day you suss out what you do want, there'll probably be a parade. Seventy six bloody trombones.
BUFFY	Spike, I...
SPIKE	Look, you don't have to say anything. We both know I can talk enough for both of --

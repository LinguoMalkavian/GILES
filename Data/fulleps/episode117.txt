ANDREW	Oh, man. Your face was priceless. "Bwaaah!"
JONATHAN	Real funny!
WARREN	Think we're all in agreement with that. Serves you right for taking Z's on lookout again.
JONATHAN	Whatta you expect? Haven't had a decent night's since... I mean, I'm going Jack Torrence in here, you know. Stuck in this basement for weeks. We rented the whole house, can't we at least sleep upstairs?
ANDREW	We're on the lam. We have to lay low. Underground.
JONATHAN	That's figurative, doofus. Did you even read Legion of Doom ?
WARREN	Okay, enough, Midgetor. Get back to the monitors. Last thing we need is to be surprised by--
ANDREW	Holy Geez Louise!
WARREN	The frickin' Slayer!
JONATHAN	That's... She's right outside!
WARREN	Don't panic. Andrew, deploy your little friend.
BUFFY	Oh. Hi.
ORDERLY	Buffy!! Stop fighting!! You're gonna hurt yourself!!! Calm down!!!
WILLOW	Hi, um... Tara. How are you? I was wondering... do you want to go out sometime? For coffee? Or food? Or kisses and gay love?
LORRAINE	Buffy? Buffy...
NURSE	C'mon. Time for your--
LORRAINE	-- drugs.
BUFFY	What?
LORRAINE	I said, if I didn't know better I'd think you were on drugs.
BUFFY	Okay. Sounds good.
LORRAINE	Here's the funny part. You're still the best of 'em.
BUFFY	I could wrestle naked in grease for a living and still be cleaner than after a shift at the Doublemeat.
WILLOW	Plus, I'd visit you at work every single day.
BUFFY	So, what'you doing?
WILLOW	I was online. Checking to see if Xander e-mailed.
BUFFY	Oh. Any luck?
WILLOW	No such. I mean, I get the deal: that special I-left-a-girl-at-the altar feeling -- I'm sure he needs some alone-time. But, still...
BUFFY	Maybe Anya found him, and they're working it out... Hey, how come you're all about home and hearth and DSL? I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
WILLOW	Saw her. Saw her completely.
BUFFY	Ow. I got a little scratch from all the brittle.
WILLOW	It's, when I was seeing her, she was seeing someone else. A girl
BUFFY	What? You mean...
WILLOW	Not seeing seeing a girl, well, maybe. I don't know. It was inconclusive, and I didn't stick around to find Out. Might've magicked my fist through a wall or something.
BUFFY	Oh, Will. I'm so sorry.
WILLOW	They're prob'ly just friends. I press my lips against my friends all the time.
BUFFY	I'm sure they're just friends. When someone falls for Willow, they stay fallen.
WILLOW	Thanks, Buff.
XANDER	Hi. I'm back.
WILLOW	Xander! You're here!
XANDER	I know. I tried calling. But I couldn't talk without..
BUFFY	Are you okay?
XANDER	I'm sorry. For disappearing. For walking out like that.
BUFFY	You don't need to apologize to us.
XANDER	Right. Is she here?
WILLOW	Oh. No. You want to find her?
XANDER	I need to. Her suitcase was gone, some of her stuff. The Magic Box has a 'closed' sign, which, like, chills me to the bone--
WILLOW	She left a couple days ago.
BUFFY	We thought maybe you guys'd find each other.
XANDER	Was she looking for me? Before she left, did she say anything?
WILLOW	You mean between the sobs? There was mostly just wheezing.
BUFFY	She was kinda, she got a little broken.
XANDER	Oh, God... I didn't mean... I don't know how this got so mixed up. I blew it.
BUFFY	No. Well... there were probably better times to break up with her--
XANDER	No! I mean, it wasn't about breaking up. I love her. And god, I miss her so much. Driving out of town, I kept turning to ask her if it was gonna be okay, and each time... she wasn't there.
WILLOW	So, you left her at the altar but... you still want...?
BUFFY	You still want to date ?
XANDER	I guess. I know my life is better with her in it. It got all complicated with the wedding. With my family, and her... demons And what if it all goes to hell? And forever. But then I left, and ever since, it's been like there's this painful hole inside... and I'm the idiot that dug it out.
BUFFY	Hey, we all screw up. And who knows, sometimes life gives us what we need anyway.
SPIKE	Looking for me?
BUFFY	Really not.
SPIKE	Oh. Right then, off you go...
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	The wedding. Two hearts united for eternity, great pelting showers of rice and so forth.
BUFFY	You didn't hear?
SPIKE	What? Families get outta hand, tear the place up?
BUFFY	No. Well, yeah, absolutely. But the thing is, Xander left. Wedding didn't happen.
SPIKE	Gotta say, din't see that coming.
BUFFY	It was awful. Anya was... she was devastated.
SPIKE	That right?
BUFFY	And Xander. He's got this idea maybe they can still get back together, but... he hurt her a lot.
SPIKE	Yeah, well. Some people can't see a good thing when they've got it. End up dumping the one thing they've got going for 'em--
XANDER	Should'a known you'd be tagging along.
BUFFY	Oh. Hey, guys I was, I found Spike here, and I was just trying to find out what he was doing with...
SPIKE	Tell you what, Slayer. I'll get out of your way, stop bothering you.
XANDER	Why don't you do that, Spike? Run along.
SPIKE	Guess you know all 'bout that, doncha? King of the big exit. Heard it brought the house down.
XANDER	You can't, I don't wanna hear this crap from you.
SPIKE	Right. Wouldn't wanna listen to Spike. Might get a bit 'a truth on you.
WILLOW	Okay, okay. Calm now. Let's turn around and release our very manly... thing... the other way.
XANDER	Oh hey, guess what, I forgot Willy Wannabite can't hurt me. Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.
WILLOW	Xander...
BUFFY	Guys...
SPIKE	More'n happy to beat you right through the pain, you pathetic Poof.
BUFFY	Guys... don't...
DOCTOR	Buffy? Can you hear me?
BUFFY	Whe. . . what is this?
DOCTOR	Buffy, do you know where you are?
BUFFY	Sunnydale...
DOCTOR	No, Buffy None of that is real. None of it. You're in a mental institution. You're ill. You've been with us six years now, do you remember?
JOYCE	Buffy?
JOYCE	Oh... baby. Buffy...
BUFFY	Mom...?
HANK	Sweetheart. We've missed you so much. Honey? Can you hear me?
JOYCE	Buffy? Stay with us, plea--
BUFFY	No...
WILLOW	Buffy? Are you okay?
XANDER	What happened?
WILLOW	I don't know.
SPIKE	Here. Let's get her into my crypt.
XANDER	Spike, just -- go. She's our friend, we'll take care of her.
BUFFY	I'm -- I'm... fine.
WILLOW	C'mon, Xander. Help me get her home.
SPIKE	Put a little ice on the back of her neck. She likes that.
BUFFY	I've been having these... flashes. Hallucinations, I guess.
WILLOW	Since when?
BUFFY	Night before last. I was checking houses on the list you put together, looking for Warren and his pals. Then bam. Some kind of gross, waxy demon thing poked me.
DAWN	Wax like icky ear stuff?
BUFFY	More like a melted candle.
XANDER	And when you say poke --
BUFFY	In the arm. It stung me or something, and then it was like I -- No. Not like. I was in an institution.
WILLOW	For higher learning?
BUFFY	I didn't know what it was at first. But then it happened a couple more times. There were doctors, nurses, other patients...
XANDER	Come on! That's ridiculous! What, you think this isn't real just 'cause of all the vampires and the demons and the ex- Vengeance demons and the sister that used to be a ball of universe- destroying energy?
DAWN	And the former ball of energy's glad you're back.
BUFFY	I know how it sounds. But it all felt so... real.
WILLOW	Did it hurt? The, uh, hallucination?
BUFFY	No, it... Mom was there.
DAWN	She was?
BUFFY	And dad too. They were together. Like they used to be. Before Sunnydale...
WILLOW	Okay! All in favor of research?
DOCTOR	...possibilities for a full recovery. But we have to proceed cautiously. If we're not careful --
JOYCE	Wait. There's a chance Buffy might be like she was before all this happened?
DOCTOR	Mrs. Summers, you have to understand the severity of what's happened to your daughter. For the last six years, she's been in an undifferentiated type of schizophrenia --
HANK	We know what her condition is. That's not what we're asking.
DOCTOR	There's a lot about schizophrenia that we still don't understand.
JOYCE	What do you understand?
DOCTOR	Buffy's delusion is multi layered. She believes she's some type of hero --
JOYCE	The Slayer.
DOCTOR	The Slayer, right. But that's only one level. She's also created an intricate lattice work to support her primary delusion. In her mind, she's the central figure in a fantastic world beyond imagination. She's surrounded herself with friends - - most with their own super powers -- who are as real to her as you or me. More so, unfortunately. Together they face overblown, grand conflicts against an assortment of monsters, both imaginary and rooted in actual myth. Every time we think we're getting through to her, more fanciful enemies magically appear and she - -
BUFFY	Enemies... Warren... Jonathan... They did this to me...
JOYCE	Buffy --
DOCTOR	Shh. It's all right. They can't hurt you here. You're with your family.
BUFFY	Dawn?...
HANK	That's the sister, right?
DOCTOR	The magical "key". Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion, actually rewriting the entire history of it to accommodate her need for a familial bond. But that created inconsistencies, didn't it?
JOYCE	Buffy. Listen to the doctor. What he's saying is important.
DOCTOR	Buffy, we want to help you get better. And I think you want that too. Isn't that why your friends are doing these horrible things to each other? And your enemies -- look at them. You used to create grand villains to battle against. And now what is it? Just ordinary people you went to high school with. Not gods or monsters. Just three pathetic little men who like to play with toys.
WARREN	Dude, that poison's got her drooling like a--
JONATHAN	Where've you guys been?
WARREN	Picking up some stuff.
ANDREW	And checking out Buffy on the van's remote surveillance.
WARREN	Andrew's demon pet's done some number on the Slayer. She's tripping like a Ken Russell film festival.
JONATHAN	What kind of stuff?
WARREN	What?
JONATHAN	The packages. What's in them?
ANDREW	Well, now... That's on a need to know basis only.
WARREN	Yeah. We tell you, we'd have to kill you.
JONATHAN	Better not be.
WARREN	It's just stuff, big man.
ANDREW	I still say we're gonna need eight other guys to pull this off.
WARREN	Should never've let you see that movie.
JONATHAN	Out. Getting stuff I need.
WARREN	I don't think that's a good idea.
JONATHAN	Why not?
WARREN	It's just not safe out there alone. You saw how close the Slayer got. We're a team. Something happens to you, it happens to all of us, right? And we wouldn't want that. I know you're antsy. We all are. But things are about to pick up. Big time. So we just gotta be careful right now. Stick together. 'Kay?
JONATHAN	Yeah... sure.
WILLOW	Buffy, good news. I found the demon. Fits your description and symptoms perfectly. Look, is this it?
BUFFY	Will... I feel so lost.
WILLOW	I know. You're confused, but it's just that crazy juice inside you.
BUFFY	It's more. Even before the demon. I've been so... detached.
WILLOW	We've all been kinda slumming.
BUFFY	But it's been so long... And every day I try to snap out of it. To figure out why I'm like that. Well... maybe this is why.
WILLOW	No. Buffy look at me. You're not in an institution. You've never been in an institution.
BUFFY	Yes I have.
WILLOW	What?
BUFFY	Back when I saw my first vampires... I got so scared. I told my parents about it. And they freaked out. Figured there was something seriously wrong with me. They sent me to a clinic.
WILLOW	You never said anything.
BUFFY	I was only there a couple of weeks. I stopped talking about it so they let me go. And eventually, my parents just... forgot.
WILLOW	God. That's horrible.
BUFFY	What if I never left? What if I'm still in that clinic?
WILLOW	Buffy, you're not. I'm so sorry you had to go through that, but it's in the past. You have to trust me. We're gonna get you that antidote.
BUFFY	Alone? Willow, he can't. It's too strong.
WILLOW	It's okay. We got help.
SPIKE	So, she's having the wiggings, is she? Thinks none of us are real? Bloody self-centered if you ask me. Not to mention downright stupid.
XANDER	Spike, we need muscle here, not color commentary.
SPIKE	On the other hand, could explain some things. This all being in that twisted brain of hers. Fix up some chip'n my head, make me soft so I'd fall in love with her, and then turn me into her sodden sex slave.
XANDER	What?
SPIKE	Nothing. Alternative realities, nitwit. Where we're all little figments of Buffy's funny farm delusion. In your case, her pathetic gofer figment.
XANDER	Shut up.
SPIKE	You know, different reality, you might've not left your bride at the altar. Might've gone through with it like a man.
XANDER	One more syllable about Anya or realities or figments and --
SPIKE	And what?
XANDER	You know, things really weren't this strange before Buffy showed. I mean, regular people, they don't know about demons.
SPIKE	Oh, balls. You didn't say the thing was a Glarghk Guhl Kashma'nik.
XANDER	That's 'cause I can't say Glarma --
DAWN	I made you some tea.
BUFFY	Oh. Thanks.
DAWN	Yeah. The thousand-yard stare really helps sell that.
BUFFY	I should be taller than you.
DAWN	Maybe you're not done growing.
BUFFY	Coming apart...
DAWN	What's coming apart?
BUFFY	We have to try harder. Make things better.
DAWN	I'm trying.
BUFFY	Your grades... ...stealing... and Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?
DAWN	What? No, it's -- it's the fever. It's cooking your brain --
BUFFY	We have to deal with these things, Dawn. We --
JOYCE	You don't have a sister, Buffy.
BUFFY	Dawn...
JOYCE	No, honey. Say it. It'll help you believe it.
BUFFY	I don't have a sister. I know. I didn't grow up with her, but then these monks, they made ...
HANK	Your mind. Playing tricks on you.
JOYCE	You're our little girl, Buffy. Our one and only. We've missed you so much. we just want to take you home and take care of you.
DAWN	I'm not even there, am I?
BUFFY	What?
DAWN	You said it a second ago. You don't have a sister.
BUFFY	Dawn, I didn't mean...
DAWN	I... I'm gonna go finish my chores.
XANDER	Hold it. Hold it...
WILLOW	I need its arm.
XANDER	Thank you, Spike. I'll help as soon as the blitzing pain subsides.
WILLOW	Ready?
XANDER	YI-AWGH!!
WILLOW	Xander, go to the magic shop. We'll need Alkanet Root and a handful of Nettle Leaf. Just for their medicinal properties. No magic. When you got them, meet me at the campus lab. I'll see if I can brew up an antidote the old fashioned way.
SPIKE	I'll hang a bit. Keep an eye on the wax job.
XANDER	Make sure that's all you're ogglin'.
WILLOW	Fine. Xander, let's go.
WILLOW	Buffy.
BUFFY	What happened?
WILLOW	It took a little longer than I'd hoped. No magic and all. It went boom twice, but then I got it.
BUFFY	Thank you, Will. You never stop coming through.
SPIKE	How is she?
WILLOW	Make sure she drinks that. I want to let Dawn know everything's going to be okay.
SPIKE	You all right?
BUFFY	You need to leave me alone. You're not a part of my life...
SPIKE	Fine, then. But I hope you don't think this antidote's gonna rid you of that nasty martyrdom. See, I figured it out, luv. You can't help yourself. You're not drawn to the dark like I thought. You're addicted to the misery.
SPIKE	'Cause I'm done with it. You either tell your friends about us... or I will.
BUFFY	I don't wanna go back there. I wanna be healthy again. What do I need to do?
BUFFY	Mom... please, help me. I wanna go home. With dad and you.
JOYCE	I know, honey. But you have to get better first.
DOCTOR	It's not gonna be easy, Buffy. You have to take it one step at a time.
BUFFY	Slaying?
DOCTOR	Yes, but... isn't that almost a burden? A responsibility?
BUFFY	My friends.
DOCTOR	That's right. Last summer, when you had a momentary awakening, it was them that pulled you back in.
JOYCE	Buffy, they're not really your friends. They're just tricks, keeping you from getting healthy.
DOCTOR	You have to do whatever it takes to convince yourself of that. Whatever it takes.
WILLOW	Ooh. Buffy. Didn't see you there.
BUFFY	I'm... still pretty dazed. But better.
WILLOW	No more Cookoo's Nest?
BUFFY	Thanks.
WILLOW	I can make you some food. Something big with energy to help clear your noggin. C'mon.
XANDER	Hello? I'm back. Clean and with the better smell now.
XANDER	Hey there, sane girl.
BUFFY	Um... yeah. I'm better now.
XANDER	Great. Then it's settled, we're real. Right? Guess we'll have to finish off that demon and drag it out of the basement and tell me you're up for that. I so don't wanna see Spike right now. Talk about losing touch. I hate to say it, but I almost worry about him. Almost. The things the poor guy was saying...
XANDER	Willow? What...
BUFFY	Dawn!?
DAWN	WHAT THE--!! Don't you knock?!
BUFFY	I called for you.
DAWN	Buffy, are you... okay?
BUFFY	Where do you think you're going?
DAWN	I'm going over to Janice's. Where they actually like having me around.
BUFFY	You're not going anywhere.
DAWN	Why not? You want me gone, anyway. What do you care?
BUFFY	I care. You're going downstairs with the others. It's the only way I'll get healthy.
DAWN	What are you talking about?
DAWN	Willow!! HELP!!!
DAWN	Buffy?! Please, talk to me!! You're hallucinating!
BUFFY	I know. You're just a trap for my mind.
DAWN	Look at me, Buffy. I'm right here. You're my sister. I need you and love you. Somewhere inside, you must know that's real.
BUFFY	Sure it is... 'Cause what's more real?
DAWN	Don't. Please, believe me!!
BUFFY	Or some type of. . . supergirl. Chosen to fight demons and save the world? That's ridiculous.
DAWN	STOP!! I'M REAL!!! BUFFY!!!
DAWN	Buffy, stop this! I'll be good, I promise. You're not thinking. BUFF--!!!
DOCTOR	It's okay, Buffy Don't stress yourself.
JOYCE	Honey. Take your time.
DOCTOR	Make it as easy for yourself as possible. There's nothing wrong with that.
XANDER	Buffy?
XANDER	Buffy, help me!! I need my hands!!
TARA	Hello? Anybody home?
JOYCE	Buffy?
XANDER	Buffy! HELP!!
TARA	Eximete!!! TARA Release!!!
TARA	Vis Zenobiae! Solvere! TARA Might of Zenobia! Unleash!
WILLOW	NO!! Tara!
BUFFY	I don't know I don't know I don't know...
JOYCE	Buffy, look at me. Sweetheart, I believe in you. You're a survivor. You've got what it--
BUFFY	Xander...
WILLOW	LET HER GO!!!
BUFFY	Willow!
JOYCE	Buffy, fight it! You can beat this thing. You're too good to give up.
JOYCE	Believe in yourself.
BUFFY	You're right... Thank you. Goodbye.
JOYCE	Buffy...
BUFFY	I'm so... I'm so sorry.
WILLOW	Buffy.
XANDER	We're okay. Everything's okay.
WILLOW	Buffy, sit. You'll fall over.
BUFFY	No...
WILLOW	Okay. We'll make more. We'll take care of it.
DOCTOR	I'm so sorry. There's no reaction at all. (a beat) I'm afraid we've lost her.
ANDREW	Oh, man. Your face was priceless. "Bwaaah!"
JONATHAN	Real funny!
WARREN	Think we're all in agreement with that. Serves you right for taking Z's on lookout again.
JONATHAN	Whatta you expect? Haven't had a decent night's since... I mean, I'm going Jack Torrence in here, you know. Stuck in this basement for weeks. We rented the whole house, can't we at least sleep upstairs?

WILLOW	I don't know.

WARREN	It's just stuff, big man.
ANDREW	I still say we're gonna need eight other guys to pull this off.
WARREN	Should never've let you see that movie.
JONATHAN	Out. Getting stuff I need.
WARREN	I don't think that's a good idea.
JONATHAN	Why not?
BUFFY	Will... I feel so lost.
WILLOW	I know. You're confused, but it's just that crazy juice inside you.
BUFFY	It's more. Even before the demon. I've been so... detached.
WILLOW	We've all been kinda slumming.
BUFFY	But it's been so long... And every day I try to snap out of it. To figure out why I'm like that. Well... maybe this is why.
WILLOW	No. Buffy look at me. You're not in an institution. You've never been in an institution.
BUFFY	Yes I have.
WILLOW	What?
WILLOW	You never said anything.
BUFFY	I was only there a couple of weeks. I stopped talking about it so they let me go. And eventually, my parents just... forgot.
WILLOW	God. That's horrible.
BUFFY	What if I never left? What if I'm still in that clinic?
WILLOW	Buffy, you're not. I'm so sorry you had to go through that, but it's in the past. You have to trust me. We're gonna get you that antidote.
BUFFY	Alone? Willow, he can't. It's too strong.
XANDER	Spike, we need muscle here, not color commentary.
SPIKE	On the other hand, could explain some things. This all being in that twisted brain of hers. Fix up some chip'n my head, make me soft so I'd fall in love with her, and then turn me into her sodden sex slave.
XANDER	What?
SPIKE	Nothing. Alternative realities, nitwit. Where we're all little figments of Buffy's funny farm delusion. In your case, her pathetic gofer figment.
XANDER	Shut up.
SPIKE	You know, different reality, you might've not left your bride at the altar. Might've gone through with it like a man.
XANDER	One more syllable about Anya or realities or figments and --
SPIKE	And what?
SPIKE	Oh, balls. You didn't say the thing was a Glarghk Guhl Kashma'nik.
XANDER	That's 'cause I can't say Glarma --
DAWN	Yeah. The thousand-yard stare really helps sell that.
BUFFY	I should be taller than you.
DAWN	Maybe you're not done growing.
BUFFY	Coming apart...
DAWN	What's coming apart?
BUFFY	We have to try harder. Make things better.
DAWN	I'm trying.
BUFFY	Your grades... ...stealing... and Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?
DAWN	What? No, it's -- it's the fever. It's cooking your brain --
BUFFY	I don't have a sister. I know. I didn't grow up with her, but then these monks, they made ...
HANK	Your mind. Playing tricks on you.
DAWN	I'm not even there, am I?
BUFFY	What?
DAWN	You said it a second ago. You don't have a sister.
BUFFY	Dawn, I didn't mean...
WILLOW	Xander, go to the magic shop. We'll need Alkanet Root and a handful of Nettle Leaf. Just for their medicinal properties. No magic. When you got them, meet me at the campus lab. I'll see if I can brew up an antidote the old fashioned way.
SPIKE	I'll hang a bit. Keep an eye on the wax job.
XANDER	Make sure that's all you're ogglin'.
BUFFY	What happened?
WILLOW	It took a little longer than I'd hoped. No magic and all. It went boom twice, but then I got it.
BUFFY	Mom... please, help me. I wanna go home. With dad and you.
JOYCE	I know, honey. But you have to get better first.
DOCTOR	It's not gonna be easy, Buffy. You have to take it one step at a time.
BUFFY	Slaying?
DOCTOR	Yes, but... isn't that almost a burden? A responsibility?
BUFFY	I'm... still pretty dazed. But better.
WILLOW	No more Cookoo's Nest?
BUFFY	Thanks.
WILLOW	I can make you some food. Something big with energy to help clear your noggin. C'mon.
BUFFY	Um... yeah. I'm better now.
XANDER	Great. Then it's settled, we're real. Right? Guess we'll have to finish off that demon and drag it out of the basement and tell me you're up for that. I so don't wanna see Spike right now. Talk about losing touch. I hate to say it, but I almost worry about him. Almost. The things the poor guy was saying...
BUFFY	Dawn!?
DAWN	Buffy, are you... okay?
BUFFY	Where do you think you're going?
DAWN	I'm going over to Janice's. Where they actually like having me around.
BUFFY	You're not going anywhere.
DAWN	Why not? You want me gone, anyway. What do you care?
DAWN	Buffy?! Please, talk to me!! You're hallucinating!
DAWN	Don't. Please, believe me!!
BUFFY	Or some type of. . . supergirl. Chosen to fight demons and save the world? That's ridiculous.
JOYCE	Honey. Take your time.
DOCTOR	Make it as easy for yourself as possible. There's nothing wrong with that.
BUFFY	I don't know I don't know I don't know...
JOYCE	Buffy, look at me. Sweetheart, I believe in you. You're a survivor. You've got what it--
XANDER	We're okay. Everything's okay.
WILLOW	Buffy, sit. You'll fall over.
BUFFY	No...
WILLOW	Okay. We'll make more. We'll take care of it.

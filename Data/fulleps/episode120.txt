XANDER	She's in the back, This way-
PARAMEDIC	She was shot?
XANDER	It's in the chest, I think she may-
XANDER	No. No - it was... He was trying to kill her-
WILLOW	Come back . Come back ...
XANDER	What does that mean? Is she going to-
PARAMEDIC	You need to stand back, okay? If you want us to help her we need some space.
WILLOW	Hear me! Keeper of darkness-
DEMON	Witch! How dare you invoke Osiris in this task?
WILLOW	Please. Please... Bring her back-
DEMON	You may not violate the laws of natural passing-
WILLOW	How? How is this natural?
DEMON	It is a human death, by human means.
WILLOW	But I-
DEMON	You raised one killed by mystical forces. This is not the same - she is taken by natural order. It is done.
WILLOW	No. There's got to be a way-
DEMON	It is done .
WILLOW	NO!
XANDER	Come on, Buff. Hang on. We're going to get you to the hospital-
WILLOW	How did this happen?
XANDER	Warren. He had a gun-
WILLOW	Warren?
XANDER	It went down too fast. I couldn't stop him-
PARAMEDIC	Sir, we have to go! Are you riding with us or not?
ANDREW	You think they'll let my aunt bring me my disc man?
JONATHAN	That's what you're worried about? In-flight entertainment? We're in jail -
ANDREW	We're in custody. We haven't been charged yet-
JONATHAN	Thank you, Dragnet. It doesn't matter what they call it - they got us, okay? We're going down.
ANDREW	(rolls his eyes) Don't flatter yourself. I heard him talking to the guard. He's in for parking tickets.
JONATHAN	That doesn't mean anything! The joint changes you. I heard they like the small ones, with little hands like their girlfriends-
ANDREW	You have got to chill. This isn't "Oz" - it's, like, Mayberry. Besides, Warren is going to find a way get us out of here-
JONATHAN	Yeah. I'm sure he'll be breaking us out of here any minute-
ANDREW	He will. He's just coming up with a plan. Like in "War Games", remember? That decoder Matthew Broderick used?
JONATHAN	Oh, yeah. That was rad. The one he made from the scissors and tape recorder?
ANDREW	I miss "Ferris" Matthew. "Broadway" Matthew - I find him cold.
JONATHAN	Really? I- Shut up. This is real life and nobody's coming to get us. Not your Aunt, who won't even return your one phone call-
ANDREW	She must be out of town-
JONATHAN	She. Doesn't. Care. And neither does your partner in crime, Warren-
ANDREW	Don't say that. And what do you mean, my partner in crime? We're in this together-
JONATHAN	What do you mean - what do I mean? You guys were totally going to fly off and leave me holding the bag-
ANDREW	We were not! (lame lie) I was going to carry you.
JONATHAN	No, you were setting me up, and then Warren was going to screw you over too-
ANDREW	That is so not true!
JONATHAN	Sure. He's a nice murderer who keeps his word.
ANDREW	You're wrong. And he is coming for us. He's out there right now, devising a brilliant way to get us out of here.
WARREN	Whiskey, straight up. And get a round for the house. I'm feeling expansive.
VAMPIRE	(still looking at TV) I'm watching my program.
WARREN	Wouldn't want to interrupt your 'me' time. Not even to buy the guy who killed the slayer a drink?
VAMPIRE	What's that?
WARREN	Took her out myself. I've been heading an organization - the Trio? I'm sure you've heard of us.
VAMPIRE	Uh - no-
WARREN	Not important. I cut them loose. I figure, now that Buffy's out of the picture - things are gonna change around here. I need a real gang, not a couple of wannabes.
DEMON	And you killed the slayer?
WARREN	With these hands.
DEMON	What are you - a warlock?
WARREN	Funny you mention that. I've explored all the dark arts - witchcraft, demonology... You name it I tried it against the slayer. But you know what I found really works? Gun.
VAMPIRE	You killed the slayer with a gun.
WARREN	In her own backyard. Don't under- estimate science, my friend. Good old fashioned metal meets propulsion.
DAMON	Oh man. This is gonna be good.
WARREN	The best. This town is ours.
VAMPIRE	Ours , maybe. You are screwed.
DEMON	Metal meets propulsion, yeah. But you better be a good shot!
WARREN	This... isn't the evil laugh of victory - is it?
VAMPIRE	More like the evil laugh of "you're a dead man."
WARREN	Okay. What's the joke?
DEMON	It was just on the news. Girl was shot-
VAMPIRE	(enjoying this) In her backyard-
DEMON	She survived. She's at the hospital
VAMPIRE	Yeah. I was gonna eat you myself at the commercial - but now I think it'll be more fun to let the slayer de-gut you.
ANYA	Willow-
WILLOW	Where do you keep the black arts books?
ANYA	Listen. Something's happened. I know. But you don't have to-
WILLOW	I need power.
ANYA	But not those books. I can't let you-
WILLOW	Stop .
DAWN	Buffy?
DAWN	Hey, hello , the door was...
RACK	All right... Who's next...
WARREN	I am.
RACK	You're new.
WARREN	Yeah. And I come baring dead presidents. Think we can skip the small talk?
RACK	How'd you find me?
WARREN	I talked to a guy, one of your regulars. Offered to show me the way for twenty bucks.
RACK	Should have haggled. Most of my customers will bring you here for five.
WARREN	(growing impatient) Thanks for the tip. Look, I'm in a situation here. I tried to do us all a favor, eliminate the slayer. But I guess it didn't take.
RACK	Killing a slayer. That's big business for a kid.
WARREN	I'm not a kid-
RACK	(yeah you are) okay.
WARREN	Had my own guys, the Trio - you've heard of us-
RACK	Right. What were you, a band or something?
WARREN	I thought word traveled in the underworld. We were evil? Robots were my thing. You didn't hear about the freeze ray?
RACK	Sorry. So why don't your guys help you?
WARREN	Look. I thought this was a cash for service gig, not an interview process. I need protection. I've got the slayer after me-
RACK	Slayer's the least of your problems.
WARREN	You're right. Let's talk about my skin troubles. On the scale of problems - I'd say she ranks!
RACK	If I were you, I'd be worried about the witch.
WARREN	Witch? Which witch?
RACK	Willow. Slayer's pal. She's the new power, man - anybody with intuition can feel it. She's going to blow this town away - starting with you.
WARREN	Me? What did I do to her? I mean, okay, I shot her friend but-
RACK	I feel death.
WARREN	But the slayer's alive. And - and she heals-
RACK	She may - but somebody's stone cold. That's why the witch wants your head. She can sense your essence right now. Matter of time before she finds you.
WARREN	Take it. There's that - and I can get more. Just give me something.
RACK	Hide or fight?
WARREN	Both. All of it. I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve, but not enough. I need a cover - and lots of fire power.
RACK	I can't guarantee anything. Not this time. The girl is running on fury. Never felt anything like it.
WARREN	Thanks for the tip. Nostradamus. Just load me up, okay?
DOCTOR	We've got more bleeding-
DOCTOR	Over by her left ventricle-
DOCTOR	We need to stop that bleeder!
XANDER	Willow-
WILLOW	Now .
XANDER	Will! What are you doing?! She's going to die-
WILLOW	No she isn't.
XANDER	The magic. It's not right. You said...
WILLOW	It's so small.
XANDER	Buffy!
BUFFY	What happened?
XANDER	Oh my God... Are you okay?
BUFFY	Sure. How'd I get here?
XANDER	You've got to stop doing this. I mean the dying thing is funny once. Maybe twice-
BUFFY	Willow?
WILLOW	Buffy. Hey-
BUFFY	What's wrong?
WILLOW	I'll explain. But we've got to go-
BUFFY	What? Why?
WILLOW	It's time to find Warren.
WARREN	This will get me all the way to the border?
CLERK	You'll have to change to the city bus. It's all in the folder.
WILLOW	Faster -
XANDER	I'm going as fast as I-
WILLOW	Faster-
XANDER	Would you cut that out, Will!? If you wanted to drive...
BUFFY	Willow. We need to stop. I don't like this-
WILLOW	We're close. I can feel him.
BUFFY	And we'll catch him - and he'll go to jail. Believe me, I'm finding the whole getting shot very motivating. But you're using magic-
WILLOW	If I wasn't, you'd be dead.
BUFFY	Maybe. But this isn't right. It isn't how I want it-
WILLOW	Sometimes you don't have a choice.
XANDER	I think Buffy gets the tie-breaker on this one. She was the one on the ouchy end of that bullet-
BUFFY	And you do have a choice. This isn't good for you, Will-
XANDER	You made the decision to stop for a reason. You promised us. And can I just ask - what's with the make-over of the damned? I mean, the hair-
WILLOW	Turn! Go right!
XANDER	Go - where?
WILLOW	Over there! Go the other way! Now!
XANDER	Will-
WILLOW	(commanding voice) Turn .
XANDER	Fine! Fine! Puppetmaster wants to drive? Go right ahead!
BUFFY	Will! Wait-
WILLOW	Stay back .
WILLOW	Get out .
WARREN	Please. Please. I'll do anything-
BUFFY	Willow - NO!
WILLOW	It's a robot.
BUFFY	And then what?
WILLOW	Then we'll kill him.
XANDER	What?
BUFFY	Will. Stop. You need to calm down-
WILLOW	Calm down?
BUFFY	You're angry. I am too. What Warren did, there's no excuse, but-
WILLOW	He hit Tara.
BUFFY	Oh my God-
WILLOW	Guess the last shot was the charm.
XANDER	She's dead?
WILLOW	She's dead. And now he's dead.
BUFFY	No... Oh God, Tara...
XANDER	Christ, Will. Why didn't you say anything?
WILLOW	I'm busy.
BUFFY	No. Come on, stop-
WILLOW	Don't -
BUFFY	We love you. And Tara. But we don't kill humans. This isn't the way-
WILLOW	How can you say that? Tara is dead .
BUFFY	I know... And I... I can't believe... anything. Not what happened - not what you must be going through. But if you do this - Warren destroys you too.
XANDER	You said it yourself - the magic is too strong, Will. There's no coming back from it.
WILLOW	I'm not coming back.
BUFFY	Don't. Please. We'll get through this together-
WILLOW	We won't. Not your way.
BUFFY	Willow-
WILLOW	No. No more talking.
XANDER	But-
WILLOW	It's done !
BUFFY	Willow?
XANDER	Maybe she went to the hospital to find you...
BUFFY	I left there hours ago. She'd be back by now.
BUFFY	Dawny?
BUFFY	Oh... God.
DAWN	I didn't want to leave her alone.
BUFFY	Dawn... Hey... Let's go downstairs.
DAWN	I don't understand.
BUFFY	I know, honey. I don't either.
XANDER	Sure.
XANDER	Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
XANDER	So. That's it.
BUFFY	The police left?
XANDER	Coming back tomorrow with more of their pretty yellow tape...
BUFFY	We need to find Willow.
XANDER	Yeah. She's seriously off the wagon. Warren's a dead man if she finds him
DAWN	Good.
BUFFY	Dawn, don't say that-
DAWN	Why not? I'd do it myself if I could.
BUFFY	Because you don't really feel that way-
DAWN	I do. And you should too. He killed Tara - and he nearly killed you. He needs to pay.
XANDER	Out of the mouths of babes.
BUFFY	Xander-
XANDER	I'm just saying - he's as bad as any vampire you've sent to dustville-
BUFFY	Being the slayer doesn't give me a license to kill. Warren's human.
DAWN	So?
BUFFY	So the human world has it's own rules for dealing with people like him-
XANDER	And we all know how well the rules work.
BUFFY	Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. We can't control the universe. If we were supposed to, the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does. And we'd be able to bring Tara back...
DAWN	And mom.
BUFFY	There are limits to what we can do. There should be. Willow doesn't want to believe it - and now she's messing with forces that want to hurt her. All of us.
XANDER	I just - I've had blood on my hands all day. Blood from people I love.
BUFFY	I know. And now it has to stop. Warren's going to get what he deserves. I promise you. But I won't let Willow destroy herself.
XANDER	So where do we go? She could be anywhere.
BUFFY	Maybe the magic shop. There could be some kind of locating spell... (quickly/to Xander) I can go alone, if you-
XANDER	No. I'll go. It's okay.
BUFFY	Dawny can't stay here-
DAWN	Let me come with you. I want to.
BUFFY	No, honey, it's too dangerous-
DAWN	But it's Willow. She needs us.
BUFFY	She does. And you'll help her. Lots. But first we have to get her home in one piece.
DAWN	But-
BUFFY	Dawn. I'm serious. You've been through enough for one - ever. Okay? You should be somewhere you'll feel safe.
DAWN	Fine. I want to go to Spike's.
BUFFY	Alright.
XANDER	What? Not alright. Are you kidding? After what he did to-
BUFFY	Xander.
XANDER	You're not really leaving Dawn with Mr. Attempted Rape-
BUFFY	He'd never hurt Dawn. He physically can't. And he wouldn't-
XANDER	After the other night, I'd say all bets are off on what he's capable of-
BUFFY	She feels safe with him. We don't have a choice, Xander. Right now - he's all we've got.
WILLOW	Blood of the slain - hear me. Guide me to Tara's killer.
BUFFY	Spike-
CLEM	Suffering cats! Where did you come from!?
BUFFY	Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you-
CLEM	Wooooh... It's - it's okay... You just snuck up on me is all-
BUFFY	I spilled your snacks.
CLEM	Don't worry about it. Not like I need more of this. -- (to Dawn) Hi.
DAWN	Hi.
CLEM	Can I get you ladies something? I was just going to mix up some Country Time.
BUFFY	We were looking for Spike, actually.
CLEM	He... didn't tell you?
BUFFY	Tell me what?
CLEM	He left. Town.
BUFFY	Oh.
DAWN	He just took off?
CLEM	That's why I'm staying here for him. Sweet pad like this goes empty a few days, you'll lose it for sure. Plus - I don't have a TV.
BUFFY	We're fine, thanks. But you could do us a favor... You think Dawn could hang out here with you for a while? I have some stuff to do and I don't want her to be alone.
DAWN	I still don't see why I can't-
BUFFY	Dawn. I told you why. What do you think?
CLEM	No problem. I'd love the company. You like Parcheesi?
DAWN	Sure.
CLEM	Or we could rent videos. I've been dying to see The Wedding Planner.
DAWN	Either way. I'm good.
CLEM	Here. You take the comfy chair.
BUFFY	I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.
DAWN	Okay.
BUFFY	Thank you.
CLEM	Spike? No. Only that he could be gone a while.
VILLAGER	Toyenza coyengara. Erio mtuwana.
VILLAGER	You can't go in there. It's very dangerous.
SPIKE	Not asking permission, mate.
VILLAGER	Ymirira! odja kufa! Ymirira!
VILLAGER	Stop! You'll die! Stop!
VOICE	You seek me, vampire?
SPIKE	You do the finger paintings? Nice work.
VOICE	Answer me.
SPIKE	Yeah. I seek you.
VOICE	Something about a woman. The slayer-
SPIKE	Thinks she's better than me. Ever since I got this bleeding chip in my head, I haven't been right. Everything's gone to hell-
VOICE	And you want to return. To your former self...
SPIKE	Yeah.
VOICE	Look what she's reduced you to.
SPIKE	It's this bloody chip, not-
VOICE	You were a legendary dark warrior - and you let yourself be castrated. Now you have the audacity to crawl in here and demand restoration?
SPIKE	I'm still a warrior-
VOICE	You're a pathetic excuse for a demon-
SPIKE	Yeah? I'll show you who's pathetic. Give me your best shot, Lurky.
VOICE	You'd never endure the trials required to grant your request-
SPIKE	Do your worst. But when I win, I want what I came here for. Bitch is going to see a change.
XANDER	Are you feeling any change? Can you talk?
ANYA	It's wearing off... Willow was here earlier. Put the whammy on me. Then she went straight to the dark arts books. Sucked them dry.
XANDER	Look, Anya, something terrible happened-
ANYA	I know. Tara.
XANDER	Willow's out for blood, big time. We need to find her before she finds Warren. Can you think of something? A locator spell...
ANYA	I don't need a spell. I can feel her.
XANDER	You can...
ANYA	Feel her. Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.
XANDER	Is that like, left over, from your vengeance demon days? That you can sense her?
ANYA	Not left over.
XANDER	Oh.
ANYA	Yeah.
XANDER	When.
ANYA	When do you think?
BUFFY	Are you okay? Did Willow - ?
ANYA	Got a power boost, then took off.
XANDER	Anya was saying she knows where Will is.
BUFFY	A spell?
XANDER	Not exactly. Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
BUFFY	Oh.
XANDER	So Willow's all wrathy - why don't you go to her? Isn't that your gig?
ANYA	Normally, I'd have to - but she doesn't want me.
BUFFY	She wants to do it herself.
ANYA	Yeah.
BUFFY	Anya. We don't have much time. Which side of this are you on?
XANDER	If you know where she is - you can help us.
ANYA	I'll help. But I'm helping Willow. She's close to him. In the woods.
WILLOW	Run all night, Warren. I'll still find-
WILLOW	Axe - not gonna cut it.
WARREN	Cute. Cute trick.
WILLOW	Oh. You mean, instead of killing my best friend you killed my girlfriend-
WARREN	It wasn't personal, that's all-
WILLOW	Well this is.
WARREN	Capture!
WILLOW	Irretite.
WILLOW	Ensnare.
WILLOW	Cute tricks.
WARREN	You're really asking for it, you know that?
WILLOW	I'm asking for it.
WARREN	I'm gonna walk away from this - and when I do, you're gonna beg to go join your little girlfriend.
WILLOW	She wasn't your first.
WARREN	First - who?
WILLOW	Tara. She wasn't the first girl you killed.
WARREN	I don't know what you're-
WILLOW	(in Latin) Reveal.
KATRINA	Back when we shared a bed. I should have done the world a favor.
WARREN	It - it's a trick.
KATRINA	Why, Warren? You could have let me go...
WARREN	(to Willow/urgent) Make it shut up. Make it go away-
KATRINA	It didn't have be like that-
WARREN	I'm not kidding!
KATRINA	How could you say you loved me, and do that to me?
WARREN	Because you deserved it, bitch!
WILLOW	Because you liked it.
WARREN	Shut up-
WILLOW	You never felt like you had the power with her. Not until you killed her-
WARREN	God - women. You're just like the rest of them. Mind games-
WILLOW	Now you get off on it. That's why you had such a mad-on for the slayer. She was the big O - wasn't she, Warren?
WARREN	Right. You done yet? Or can we talk some more about our "feelings?"
BUFFY	What's happening? What do you feel?
ANYA	She's stronger now. Close.
XANDER	What about Warren? Has she-
ANYA	He's still alive. She's not done.
BUFFY	Let's move.
WARREN	Let me - ! HELP! Somebody!
WILLOW	What's the matter? I thought you wanted to talk.
WARREN	No-
WILLOW	Okay.
WARREN	What-- what are you doing?
WILLOW	Shhhhhh.
WARREN	Hey, hey - I'm sorry, okay? I -
WILLOW	(cutting him off) Want to know what a bullet feels like, Warren? A real one? It's not like in the comics.
WARREN	No, no-
WILLOW	I think you need to. Feel it.
WARREN	Oh God... Stop it -
WILLOW	It's not going to make a neat little hole. First - it'll obliterate your internal organs. Your lung will collapse. Feels like drowning...
WARREN	Please! No-
WILLOW	When it finally hits your spine, it'll blow your central nervous system-
WARREN	Stop!! God, please! I - I'll do anything-
WILLOW	I'm talking . The pain will be unbearable, but you won't be able to move... Bullets usually travel faster than this, of course. But the dying? It's going to seem like it takes forever.
ANYA	Over there.
WILLOW	I said - can you feel it?
WARREN	Please, God... I did wrong, I see that now. I need jail. I need... But you - you don't want this. You're not a bad person. Not like me-
WARREN	When you get caught - you'll lose them too. Your friends. WARREN You don't want that. I know... You're in pain but-
WILLOW	Bored now.
XANDER	Oh my God.
BUFFY	Willow - no... What did you do?
WILLOW	One down.

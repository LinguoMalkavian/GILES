CORDELIA	Me in bright spring fashions...
MITCH	Spring training...
CORDELIA	Me at the end-of-school dance...
CORDELIA	Definitely my favorite time of year!
CORDELIA	... I am, of course, having my dress specially made. Off-the-rack gives me hives.
MITCH	Let me guess. Blue, like your eyes.
CORDELIA	My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller.
HARMONY	You two will look so fine together in the May Queen photo.
CORDELIA	Well, technically, I haven't been elected May Queen yet.
CORDELIA	Behold the weirdness.
BUFFY	You're probably wondering what I'm doing with this stuff.
CORDELIA	Wow, I'm not .
BUFFY	It's actually... show-and-tell! For history class. Mr. Giles has this, like, hobby. A hobby of collecting stuff. Which he lent me. For show-and-tell. Did I mention it's for history class?
HARMONY	She is always hanging with the creepy librarian in that creepy library.
MITCH	Ew, libraries. All those books. What's up with that?
CORDELIA	Did I ever tell you about when Buffy attacked me ? With a spear when I came out of the ladies' at the Bronze. I still re-live the trauma every time I see a pencil. I can only use felt-tip now...
MILLER	"If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?" OK, so talk to me, people. How does what Shylock says here, about being a Jew, relate to our discussion about the anger of the outcast at society?
MILLER	Cordelia, what's Shylock saying?
CORDELIA	How about, "color me totally self-involved".
MILLER	Care to elaborate?
CORDELIA	With Shylock it's whine, whine, whine, like the whole world is about him! He acts like it's justice, him getting a pound of Antonio's flesh. It's not justice, it's yicky.
MILLER	But has Shylock suffered? What's his place in Venice Society?
WILLOW	Well, everyone looks down on him --
CORDELIA	That's such a twinkie defense! Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like the time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike, and it was the most traumatizing even of my life , and she's trying to make it al about her leg! Like my pain meant nothing !...
MILLER	Cordelia's raised an interesting point here -- Which we will pursue next time.
CORDELIA	Ms. Miller?
MILLER	Some good observations today, Cordelia. Always exciting to know someone's actually done the reading.
CORDELIA	I wanted to talk to you about my final paper. I'm real unfocused. I have all these points, and I'm pretty sure they all contradict each other.
MILLER	I have your outline here somewhere... Why don't you stop in after school tomorrow, we can go over it.
CORDELIA	That's great, thanks.
MILLER	I'll see you then.
MITCH	Later. I'm picking out my tux first. Got to look sharp for the big 'dig.
MITCH	It's not her arm I'm looking to be on.
MITCH	Who's there?
MITCH	Okay, fun time's over. Come out!
CORDELIA	Remember who to vote for for May Queen. As in, me.
CORDELIA	Isn’t this the BOMB? I’m SUCH the campaign strategist.
HARMONY	“C”. For Cordelia?
CORDELIA	No, “C” for Wilma. Of course it’s for Cordelia, little brain. This way, people will associate me, Cordelia, with something sweet!
CORDELIA	I don’t think I need the loony fringe vote.
BUFFY	I don’t even like chocolate. (to herself) Well, that was the lamest comeback of our times...
XANDER	Hey! What’s Cordelia up to?
BUFFY	Bribery. She’s desperate to be the May Queen.
XANDER	Cordelia, man... she does love titles.
WILLOW	Oh, God, remember in sixth grade... the field trip? When Cordelia --
XANDER	-- right, right, the guy with the antlers on his belt --
WILLOW	“Be my deputy!”
XANDER	And she had the ... with the hat...
WILLOW	The hat!
XANDER	Oh Man...
BUFFY	Okay, it’s fun that we’re speaking in tongues...
WILLOW	I’m sorry...
XANDER	It was, we had this... you had to be there.
WILLOW	It’s not even funny.
XANDER	Really.
WILLOW	Cordelia just has a history of trying too hard.
XANDER	What kind of moron would be May Queen anyway?
BUFFY	I was.
XANDER	You what?
BUFFY	At my old school.
XANDER	So, the good kind of moron would do that. The non-moron, I mean. I’ll be in a quiet place now.
BUFFY	I mean, we didn’t call it May Queen, but we had the dance, and the coronation, all that stuff. It was nice.
XANDER	Well, you don’t need that stuff now. You’ve got us.
WILLOW	“Be my deputy!”
SNYDER	-- dead? Of course not, dead! What are you, ghouls? There are no dead students here! This week. Now clear back, make room, all of you!
BUFFY	Mitch, what happened?
MITCH	I don’t know... I heard something, I tried to grab a bat... and it hit me.
BUFFY	What hit you?
MITCH	The bat. By itself. Thing was floating! Knocked me out...
BUFFY	I better check out the scene.
SNYDER	Where do you think you’re going? BUFFY Uh... Mitch wanted me to get... his comb. He likes his comb.
SNYDER	I don’t think Mitch needs his comb right now. I think Mitch needs medical attention and you need to stay away from the crime scene. You’re always sticking your nose in --
WILLOW	What did you say? Mitch is gonna sue the school?
SNYDER	Sue? Who?
XANDER	Well, his dad is the most powerful lawyer in Sunnydale.
SNYDER	Hold on! What have you two heard?
XANDER	Mitch’s dad. The lawyer. You’ve never heard of him?
WILLOW	Other lawyers call him the Beast.
WILLOW	“Look?” That’s all it said?
XANDER	Look at what? Look at Mitch?
BUFFY	Maybe. All I know is it’s a message.
XANDER	And?
BUFFY	And monsters don’t usually send messages. It’s pretty much, “kill, crush, destroy”. This is different.
GILES	I’d say you’re right.
BUFFY	I love it when you say that. Any theories?
GILES	Well, I’m not sure this is the place for discussing it.
BUFFY	It’s not like anyone ever sits close enough to overhear us. Come on. Give.
GILES	It is a bit of a puzzle. I haven’t actually ever heard of someone being attacked by a baseball bat.
XANDER	Maybe it’s a vampire bat. I’m alone on that one.
GILES	Well, assuming the bat itself is not possessed, there are a few possibilities that bear investigating. Someone with telekinesis, the power to move objects at will... some invisible creature... or possibly a poltergeist.
WILLOW	A ghost?
GILES	Yes. An angry one.
BUFFY	Angry is right. It was a real scene in that locker room.
WILLOW	So, if it’s a ghost, then we’re talking about a dead kid?
BUFFY	I suppose so. Willow, why don’t you compile a list of kids who’ve died here who might have turned into ghosts.
XANDER	We’re on a Hellmouth. It’s gonna be a long list.
WILLOW	Have you seen the “In Memoriam” section in the yearbook?
GILES	I’ll research all the possibilities, ghosts included. Xander, may I count on your help there?
XANDER	What, there’s homework now? How does that happen?
BUFFY	It’s all part of the glamorous world of vampire slaying.
XANDER	Well, what are you going to be doing?
BUFFY	Finding out what I can about Mitch. This attack wasn’t random.
XANDER	Well, I think I should do that part.
BUFFY	Fine. Ask around. Talk to his friends. Talk to Cordelia.
XANDER	Talk to Cordelia? So, research, huh?
HARMONY	Cordelia! You weren’t in fifth period --
CORDELIA	I went to the hospital.
HARMONY	Mitch. How is he? Will he be OK?
CORDELIA	The doctor said he’s fine, he’ll be sent home tomorrow. Oh, you should have seen him -- lying there, all black and blue... How’s he going to look in our prom pictures? How will I ever be able to show them to anyone?
HARMONY	They can do wonderful things with airbrushes these days...
CORDELIA	You think?
CORDELIA	Did you see Mitch? He broke up with Wendy like eight seconds ago and he’s already nosing around.
HARMONY	It’s shameless.
CORDELIA	In the spring, if he makes varsity baseball, maybe I’ll take him on a test-drive...
CORDELIA	What do you want?
CORDELIA	I just hope somebody can prop him up long enough to take the picture...
BUFFY	Cordelia. Can I talk to you?
CORDELIA	Oh, great.
HARMONY	Why is she always --
SNYDER	For heaven’s sake!
SNYDER	Clear back, everyone! Give her some air! Air, breathe, good. You! School nurse. Now!
HARMONY	My ankle -- I think it’s broken...
BUFFY	What happened?
SNYDER	Hey! Who’s the principal here? What happened?
CORDELIA	She just fell! We were coming down the stairs and she just fell! All by herself!
HARMONY	No, I was pushed!
VOICE	She deserved it.
BUFFY	How can you say that?...
BUFFY	Okay, I know someone’s here. I just want to talk to you. I won’t hurt you.
WILLOW	Dead kids.
BUFFY	Yikes.
WILLOW	I was gonna pull up “missing” too, but I didn’t have enough time.
XANDER	What’s the word on Harmony?
GILES	I believe it was a compound fracture. Not wonderful fun.
XANDER	This is a fairly testy ghost we’ve got.
BUFFY	Maybe.
XANDER	You think “Testy” is too strong a word? ‘Cause I felt I was understating --
BUFFY	Giles, have you ever touched a ghost?
GILES	No I haven’t. I’ve seen one, in Dartmoor. A murdered countess, very beautiful. She used to float along the foothills, moaning the most piteous -- I’ve gone away again, haven’t I?
WILLOW	It’s funny when he does that.
BUFFY	We were talking about touching.
GILES	Yes. Well, from what I’ve read, having a ghost pass through you is a singular experience. It’s a cold, amorphous feeling, makes your hair stand up.
BUFFY	Okay, this is my problem. I touched the thing. It didn’t go through me, it bumped into me. And it wasn’t cold.
XANDER	So that means, what -- that we’re talking about an invisible person?
BUFFY	A girl. She spoke. She said Harmony deserved what she got.
GILES	A girl on campus with the power to turn invisible.
XANDER	Man, that is so cool.
WILLOW	Cool?
XANDER	I’d give anything to be able to turn invisible. (off their looks) Well I wouldn’t be beating people up. I’d use my power to protect the girl’s locker room.
GILES	It probably is having an awfully heady experience, having that ability.
WILLOW	So how’d she get it? Is she a witch? ‘Cause we can fight a witch.
XANDER	Greek myths talk about cloaks of invisibility, but they’re usually just for the gods. Research boy comes through with the knowledge.
BUFFY	This girl’s sort of petty, for a God.
WILLOW	She’s got a grudge. But why Harmony?
XANDER	Harmony and Mitch. And the common denominator there --
BUFFY	Is Cordelia.
WILLOW	So what now?
BUFFY	First thing tomorrow, pull up that missing kids list. Maybe this girl’s made herself invisible for long enough for someone to notice she’s gone.
WILLOW	Got it. I’ll see you then.
BUFFY	Good.
XANDER	See ya.
XANDER	Why don’t you have dinner at our place? Mom’s making her famous phone call to the Chinese place. WILLOW Again? Xander, do you guys have a stove?
GILES	I’ll start looking into ways to decloak an invisible someone. And you?
BUFFY	I think Cordelia’s gonna be working on the May Queen decorations. There might be some action. It’s time for me to start the hunt.
GILES	And how exactly do you propose to hunt someone you can’t see?
BUFFY	Hello? Invisible person?
BUFFY	I know you’re here. I know I can’t see you. It’s a good trick. Care to teach it to me?
GILES	Who’s there?
GILES	Of course. Vampires cast no reflection.
ANGEL	Don’t worry. I’m not here to eat.
GILES	Buffy told me you don’t feed on humans anymore.
ANGEL	Not for a long while.
GILES	Is that why you’re here? To see her?
ANGEL	I can’t. It’s it’s too hard for me to be around her.
GILES	A vampire in love with the Slayer. It’s rather poetic, in a maudlin sort of way. Well, what can I do for you?
ANGEL	I know you’ve been researching the Master.
GILES	The Vampire King. Yes, I’m trying to learn all I can about him. For the day when Buffy must face him. I haven’t learned much, I’m afraid.
ANGEL	Things I’ve heard lately from -- Things you wouldn’t care to meet -- Something’s already in motion -- something big -- but I don’t know what. You’ve read all the Slayer lore there is, right?
GILES	I’ve studied all the extant volumes, of course. But the most important books of Slayer prophecy have been lost. The Tiberius Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex.
ANGEL	The Codex.
GILES	It was reputed to contain the most complete prophecies about the Slayer’s role in the End Times. But the book was lost in the 15th century.
ANGEL	Not lost. Misplaced. I can get it.
GILES	That would be very helpful. My own volumes seem to be useless of late.
ANGEL	Legends of Vishnu?
GILES	Oh, there’s an invisible girl terrorizing the school.
ANGEL	Oh. That’s not really my area of expertise.
GILES	Nor mine, I’m afraid. It’s fascinating, though. By all accounts a wonderful power to have.
ANGEL	I don’t know. Looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there...
CORDELIA	God, I am never sitting through one of those alumni lectures again. Two hours of “My Treck Though Nepal”. Hello! There’s nobody caring.
MARCIE	Did you see his toupee? It looked like a cabbage.
CORDELIA	And those slides. “That’s a mountain. Yes, that’s a mountain too. Now let’s look at some mountains.”
HARMONY	I swear he only had three slides and he just used them over and over.
MARCIE	Did you guys notice his toupee --
HARMONY	We’re talking, okay?
CORDELIA	Oh! And did you guys check out the extreme toupee? Yeah, that’s realistic. Looked like a cabbage.
SNYDER	Introducing... our new May Queen! Oh, you’re here.
CORDELIA	Thank you. For making the right choice. For showing how much you all love me!
BUFFY	Did you guys just hear something?
XANDER	Just the hiss of hot air.
CORDELIA	Being this popular isn’t just my right, it’s my responsibility, and I want you to know I take it seriously...
XANDER	Giles said you’d be here. Why are you being here?
BUFFY	Last night was a bust. But I still think Cordy’s the key here.
WILLOW	The missing girls list. They’ve mostly stayed missing. I pulled their classes, activities, medical records...
BUFFY	Good work.
WILLOW	Has Cordelia hired a bodyguard or something?
BUFFY	Whoa, check it out. the most recent one. Marcie Ross... disappeared almost six months ago.
XANDER	I don’t know her.
WILLOW	Me neither.
BUFFY	Well, her only activity was band. She played the flute.
WILLOW	So?
BUFFY	I heard a flute last night, when I was hunting. I couldn’t find out where it was coming from.
XANDER	What did it sound like?
BUFFY	Sad. Real sad. But it was the band room where I lost Ms. Invisible yesterday... This tracks. I’ve got a free now, I’ll check it out.
XANDER	OK, we’ll see you after geometry.
CORDELIA	So come to my coronation tonight at the Bronze, for an evening you’ll never forget!
BUFFY	Okay. There’s something about this room. We keep coming back. What is it?
BUFFY	It, I presume...
BUFFY	Marcie Ross. So it is you...
MILLER	Cordelia? Could you be on time?
MILLER	Who’s there?
CORDELIA	Ms. Miller, oh-my-god...
CORDELIA	Are you okay? What happened?
MILLER	Attacked.. Didn’t see...
BUFFY	It looked like Marcie’s been there for months. It’s where I found this.
BUFFY	Check it out.
WILLOW	Oh my god...
WILLOW	“Have a nice summer.” “Have a nice summer....” This girl had no friends at all .
GILES	Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generation gap.
BUFFY	“Have a nice summer” is what you write when you have nothing to say.
XANDER	It’s the kiss of death.
BUFFY	And you guys didn’t know Marcie Ross?
XANDER	Never met her, why?
BUFFY	‘Cause you both wrote it too.
XANDER	“Have a nice --” yeeesh.
WILLOW	Where am I? Oh. “Have a great summer.” See, I cared.
BUFFY	But you don’t remember her.
XANDER	Well, we probably didn’t see her except to sign the book, this is a big school --
WILLOW	Xander, we each had four classes with her last year!
BUFFY	And you never noticed her. And now she’s invisible...
XANDER	What, she turned invisible because no one noticed her?
GILES	Of course! ...
GILES	I’ve been investigating mystical causes of invisibility when I should have looked to the quantum mechanical ! Physics. Reality is shaped, even created by our perception of it.
BUFFY	And with the Hellmouth below us sending out mystical energy --
GILES	People perceived Marcie as invisible, and she became so.
XANDER	But people perceived the whole Marcie package as invisible, clothes and all, not just, you know... (what’s bothering him) So you’re saying she’s not naked.
BUFFY	It isn’t this great power she can control, it’s something that was done to her. That we did to her.
WILLOW	No wonder she’s miffed. But what does she want?
BUFFY	Just what we thought.
BUFFY	Cordelia.
CORDELIA	I knew I’d find you here.
XANDER	A-and you would be wanting what?
CORDELIA	Buffy, I, uh, know we’ve had our difference, you being so weird and all, and hanging out with these, ugh, total losers, and... Well anyway, despite all that, I know you share this feeling we have for each other, deep down...
WILLOW	Nausea?
CORDELIA	Somebody’s after me! Someone just tried to kill Ms. Miller! She was helping me with my homework! And Mitch and Harmony...! This is all about me! Me! Me! Me!
XANDER	Wow. For once she’s right.
BUFFY	So you’re coming to me for help? There’s a Why? inside me screaming to get out.
CORDELIA	I don’t know... because you’re always around when stuff happens, I know you’re strong and you got those weapons... I was kind of hoping you’re in a gang.
WILLOW	The Ugh- Total -Losers Gang.
CORDELIA	Please... I don’t know where else to turn.
GILES	Please sit down Do you know... I don’t recall ever seeing you here before.
CORDELIA	Oh, no. I have a life.
BUFFY	Cordelia, the attacker is an invisible girl.
XANDER	Who is really, really angry at you. I can’t imagine that, personally, but it takes all kinds, you know?
CORDELIA	I don’t care what it is, just get rid of it!
BUFFY	It’s not that simple. It’s a
CORDELIA	God, is she wearing Laura Ashley ?
WILLOW	So homicidal?
CORDELIA	I have no idea at all! I’ve never seen this girl before in my life!
MILLER	Cordelia.
CORDELIA	Well, just because the story’s about him doesn’t mean he’s necessarily the hero, right?
MILLER	Exactly. What would we call him? Willow.
WILLOW	Well, the protagonist.
XANDER	He can’t be both? ‘Cause some of the stuff he does is heroic.
VOICE	I’ll show them.... idiots... show them all, they’re never gonna forget... ought to KILL, I could KILL... I’m right here, I’m coming for you... right behind you -- IDIOTS!
BUFFY	Well, Marcie remembers you.
GILES	According to what you’ve told us about the attack on Ms. Miller, we now have two messages from Marcie: Look and Listen.
WILLOW	messages we don’t understand.
BUFFY	I’m not sure we’re supposed to, yet. Marcie’s not quite ready. From what she did to Cordelia’s picture, I’d say she’s wigged on the whole May Queen thing. Maybe she’s going to do something about it, but at a time of her choosing.
WILLOW	Stop the coronation tonight, maybe. Keep you guys out of the Bronze.
CORDELIA	Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight.
XANDER	Can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?
CORDELIA	If I’m not crowned tonight, then... then Marcie’s won! And that’s bad! She’s evil, okay? Way eviler than me.
BUFFY	She has a point.
CORDELIA	Buffy’s with me on this.
BUFFY	Anyway, continuing the normal May Queen activities is probably the best way to draw Marcie out. Cordelia is our bait.
CORDELIA	Great! What?
GILES	Willow and Xander will help me begin our research anew.
XANDER	He can just say that and then we have to.
GILES	Unless we can find a way to cure Macie’s invisibility, Buffy will be --
BUFFY	A sitting duck Come on.
CORDELIA	I need to try on my dress. Am I really bait?
BUFFY	OK, I think it’s clear.
CORDELIA	So how much the creepy is that this Marcie’s been at this for months ? Spying on us, learning our most guarded secrets...
CORDELIA	And she turned invisible ‘cause she’s so unpopular? Bummer for her.
BUFFY	That about sums it up.
CORDELIA	It’s awful to feel that lonely.
BUFFY	Oh, so you’ve read about that feeling?
CORDELIA	You think I’m never lonely, just ‘cause I’m so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It’s not like any of them really know me. I don’t even know if they really like me half the time. People just want to be in the popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone’s so busy agreeing with me, they don’t hear a word I say.
BUFFY	If you feel so alone, why do you work so hard to be popular?
CORDELIA	Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.
XANDER	So what’s the answer, Mr. Wizard? Potion, ritual, really silly spell requiring you to shout things?
WILLOW	Right, how do we make Marcie visible?
GILES	We don’t.
WILLOW	You mean... it’s permanent?
GILES	I mean apparently gift as a researcher is limited to supernatural rather than quantum phenomena. All these state functions, observables... Mathematics was never my strength.
WILLOW	Ssssh! Listen!
GILES	Perhaps we can talk to her, reason with her. (off their reactions) Or possibly grab her.
WILLOW	There are three of us...
XANDER	Let’s go!
CORDELIA	If you ever tell anyone I changed in a mop closet...
BUFFY	Your secret dies with me.
BUFFY	Looks okay. But hurry.
XANDER	Over here!
GILES	Marcie. We know what has happened to you. Please talk to us.
WILLOW	We’re so sorry we ignored you.
XANDER	Can you say “gulp?”
WILLOW	Does anybody else feel like a major idiot?
GILES	What’s that sound?
BUFFY	You know, what you were saying before... I understand. It doesn’t matter how popular you are --
CORDELIA	You were popular? In what alternate universe?
BUFFY	In L.A. That point is, I did sort of feel like something was missing --
CORDELIA	Is that when you became weird and got kicked out?
BUFFY	Okay, can we have the heartfelt talk with less talk from you? Cordelia?
BUFFY	Cordelia!
GILES	Gas!
GILES	She’s snuffed out the pilot light! The gas is up full, but I can’t find the shutoff!
XANDER	Is this it?
WILLOW	OK, that’s bad, How about the door?
GILES	No! One spark and you’ll take the whole building with us!
CORDELIA	Buffy? You’re awake?
BUFFY	Yeah.
CORDELIA	I can’t move.
BUFFY	Neither can I.
CORDELIA	I can’t feel my face.
BUFFY	What do you mean?
CORDELIA	My face! It feels numb. What is she doing?
BUFFY	I don’t know.
CORDELIA	What does that mean ?
BUFFY	I don’t know.
GILES	That should give us a few minutes, but if we cannot escape this room...
WILLOW	Why is Marcie doing this?
GILES	The isolation, the exile she’s endured... she has gone mad.
XANDER	Ya think ?
VOICE	I’m disappointed. I really hoped you would have figured it out by now.
BUFFY	Why don’t you explain it? What are we supposed to learn?
CORDELIA	Yeah, what do you want to teach us?
VOICE	No, you don’t get it. You’re not the student. You’re the lesson.
CORDELIA	What have you done to my face?
VOICE	Your face. That’s what it’s all about, isn’t it? Your beautiful face. That’s what makes you shine just a little bit brighter than the rest of us. We all want what you have. To be noticed. To be remembered. To be seen.
CORDELIA	What are you doing?
VOICE	I’m fulfilling your fondest wish.
VOICE	I’m gonna give you a face no one will ever forget.
XANDER	I’m thinking we ram the door and take our chances.
WILLOW	What’re a few sparks among friends?
GILES	Sparks... Sparks are caused by metal on metal...
GILES	One, two, three!
GILES	Again! Again!
BUFFY	Marcie... you can’t do this.
VOICE	What are you gonna do? Slay me?
BUFFY	Marcie, you know it’s wrong...
VOICE	You should have stayed out of my way. You know, I actually thought you might understand my vision. But you’re just like them. Maybe I’ll practice on you. A little warm up. This is my first operation, after all.
CORDELIA	Please don’t do this...
CORDELIA	Noo...
VOICE	You should be grateful. People who pass you in the street will remember you for the rest of their ‘lives. Children will dream bout you. And every one of your friends who comes to the coronation tonight will take the sight of the May Queen to their graves.
CORDELIA	Wait!
VOICE	We really have to get started. That local anesthetic will be wearing off soon. And I don’t want you to faint. It’s less fun if you’re not awake.
XANDER	You’re blacking out on me, guys...
VOICE	Let’s see... I think we should start with your smile. I think it should be wider.
CORDELIA	Marcie... listen... you think I don’t understand what you’re going through, but I do.
VOICE	You will...
CORDELIA	I do... and I could help you. I could. Help you meet people. Everyone could want to know you now... I mean you’re really special.
CORDELIA	I do know how you feel, how lonely...
VOICE	I’ll bet you know how I feel. I’ll be you can be with all your friends and feel so alone because they don’t really know you. You’re a typical self involved spoiled little brat, and you think you can charm your way out of this -- Isn’t that what you think?!
VOICE	I see right through you. Has her arm and leg free -- She raises her leg and KICKS the cart, sends it SLAMMING into Marcie -- which we know from the cart stopping suddenly, and the thud of Marcie’s body.
CORDELIA	Oh, God, get me out of here...
BUFFY	Just hold still -
ANGEL	Come on!
XANDER	What happened?
ANGEL	You tell me.
WILLOW	I’m up, mom...
XANDER	Hi. What do you want?
ANGEL	I brought you the codex. I came in through the basement, smelled the gas.
GILES	We’ve still got to turn it off, or it could blow the building.
ANGEL	I’ll do it. It’s not like I need the oxygen...
BUFFY	You know, I really felt bad for you. You’ve suffered. But there’s one thing I didn’t factor into all this. You’re a thundering loony.
VOICE	Hey, moron. I’m invisible.
BUFFY	I see you...
DOYLE	FBI! Nobody move!
MANETTI	We’ll take it from here, ma’am.
BUFFY	Take what from where?
DOYLE	I’m agent Doyle, this is agent Manetti. We’re here for the girl.
BUFFY	Well, where were you ten minutes ago when she was playing surgeon?
DOYLE	I’m sorry, we came as fast as we could. We’ll take care of it from here on.
BUFFY	You can cure her?
DOYLE	We can... rehabilitate her.
MANETTI	In time she’ll learn to be a useful member of society again.
DOYLE	Very useful.
BUFFY	This isn’t the first time this has happened, is it? This has happened at other schools.
MANETTI	We’re not at liberty to discuss that.
DOYLE	It would be best for you to forget this whole incident.
BUFFY	Do you guys know that you’re very creepy?
DOYLE	Thank you for your help.
MANETTI	Have a nice day.
CORDELIA	Can I get untied now?
BUFFY	I just can’t believe how twisted Marcie got. How did you guys get out of the boiler room?
GILES	Janitor. Found us and shut off the valve.
WILLOW	We were lucky.
BUFFY	I’ll say.
BUFFY	Hey.
CORDELIA	Hi. Look, I didn’t get a chance to say anything yesterday, with the coronation and everything, but... I guess I wanted to thank you. All of you.
XANDER	It’s funny ‘cause you look like Cordelia.
CORDELIA	You really helped me out, and you didn’t have to. So thanks.
BUFFY	That’s okay.
WILLOW	Listen, we’re just going to grab some lunch, if you wanted --
MITCH	Whoah, you’re not hanging with these losers, you?
CORDELIA	Are you kidding? I was just being charitable, trying to help them with their fashion problems.
CORDELIA	You really think I felt like joining that social leper colony? Please.
XANDER	Boy. Where’s an invisible girl when you really need one?
DOYLE	We think you’ll be happy here.
MANETTI	You should fit right in.
TEACHER	Welcome, Marcie. Please sit down. OK, class, please turn to page fifty-four in your texts...
CORDELIA	Me in bright spring fashions...
MITCH	Spring training...
CORDELIA	Me at the end-of-school dance...
CORDELIA	Definitely my favorite time of year!
CORDELIA	... I am, of course, having my dress specially made. Off-the-rack gives me hives.
MITCH	Let me guess. Blue, like your eyes.
CORDELIA	My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller.
HARMONY	You two will look so fine together in the May Queen photo.
CORDELIA	Well, technically, I haven't been elected May Queen yet.
BUFFY	You're probably wondering what I'm doing with this stuff.
CORDELIA	Wow, I'm not .
BUFFY	It's actually... show-and-tell! For history class. Mr. Giles has this, like, hobby. A hobby of collecting stuff. Which he lent me. For show-and-tell. Did I mention it's for history class?
HARMONY	She is always hanging with the creepy librarian in that creepy library.
MITCH	Ew, libraries. All those books. What's up with that?
MILLER	Cordelia, what's Shylock saying?
CORDELIA	How about, "color me totally self-involved".
MILLER	Care to elaborate?
CORDELIA	With Shylock it's whine, whine, whine, like the whole world is about him! He acts like it's justice, him getting a pound of Antonio's flesh. It's not justice, it's yicky.
MILLER	But has Shylock suffered? What's his place in Venice Society?
WILLOW	Well, everyone looks down on him --
CORDELIA	That's such a twinkie defense! Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like the time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike, and it was the most traumatizing even of my life , and she's trying to make it al about her leg! Like my pain meant nothing !...
MILLER	Cordelia's raised an interesting point here -- Which we will pursue next time.
CORDELIA	Ms. Miller?
MILLER	Some good observations today, Cordelia. Always exciting to know someone's actually done the reading.
CORDELIA	I wanted to talk to you about my final paper. I'm real unfocused. I have all these points, and I'm pretty sure they all contradict each other.
MILLER	I have your outline here somewhere... Why don't you stop in after school tomorrow, we can go over it.
CORDELIA	That's great, thanks.
MITCH	Later. I'm picking out my tux first. Got to look sharp for the big 'dig.
MITCH	It's not her arm I'm looking to be on.
CORDELIA	Isn’t this the BOMB? I’m SUCH the campaign strategist.
HARMONY	“C”. For Cordelia?
CORDELIA	No, “C” for Wilma. Of course it’s for Cordelia, little brain. This way, people will associate me, Cordelia, with something sweet!
CORDELIA	I don’t think I need the loony fringe vote.
BUFFY	I don’t even like chocolate. (to herself) Well, that was the lamest comeback of our times...
XANDER	Hey! What’s Cordelia up to?
BUFFY	Bribery. She’s desperate to be the May Queen.
XANDER	Cordelia, man... she does love titles.
WILLOW	Oh, God, remember in sixth grade... the field trip? When Cordelia --
XANDER	-- right, right, the guy with the antlers on his belt --
WILLOW	“Be my deputy!”
XANDER	And she had the ... with the hat...
WILLOW	The hat!
XANDER	Oh Man...
BUFFY	Okay, it’s fun that we’re speaking in tongues...
WILLOW	I’m sorry...
XANDER	It was, we had this... you had to be there.
WILLOW	It’s not even funny.
XANDER	Really.
WILLOW	Cordelia just has a history of trying too hard.
XANDER	What kind of moron would be May Queen anyway?
BUFFY	I was.
XANDER	You what?
BUFFY	At my old school.
XANDER	So, the good kind of moron would do that. The non-moron, I mean. I’ll be in a quiet place now.
BUFFY	I mean, we didn’t call it May Queen, but we had the dance, and the coronation, all that stuff. It was nice.
XANDER	Well, you don’t need that stuff now. You’ve got us.
BUFFY	Mitch, what happened?
MITCH	I don’t know... I heard something, I tried to grab a bat... and it hit me.
BUFFY	What hit you?
MITCH	The bat. By itself. Thing was floating! Knocked me out...
SNYDER	Where do you think you’re going? BUFFY Uh... Mitch wanted me to get... his comb. He likes his comb.
SNYDER	I don’t think Mitch needs his comb right now. I think Mitch needs medical attention and you need to stay away from the crime scene. You’re always sticking your nose in --
WILLOW	What did you say? Mitch is gonna sue the school?
SNYDER	Sue? Who?
XANDER	Well, his dad is the most powerful lawyer in Sunnydale.
SNYDER	Hold on! What have you two heard?
XANDER	Mitch’s dad. The lawyer. You’ve never heard of him?
WILLOW	Other lawyers call him the Beast.
WILLOW	“Look?” That’s all it said?
XANDER	Look at what? Look at Mitch?
BUFFY	Maybe. All I know is it’s a message.
XANDER	And?
BUFFY	And monsters don’t usually send messages. It’s pretty much, “kill, crush, destroy”. This is different.
GILES	I’d say you’re right.
BUFFY	I love it when you say that. Any theories?
GILES	Well, I’m not sure this is the place for discussing it.
BUFFY	It’s not like anyone ever sits close enough to overhear us. Come on. Give.
GILES	It is a bit of a puzzle. I haven’t actually ever heard of someone being attacked by a baseball bat.
XANDER	Maybe it’s a vampire bat. I’m alone on that one.
GILES	Well, assuming the bat itself is not possessed, there are a few possibilities that bear investigating. Someone with telekinesis, the power to move objects at will... some invisible creature... or possibly a poltergeist.
WILLOW	A ghost?
GILES	Yes. An angry one.
BUFFY	Angry is right. It was a real scene in that locker room.
WILLOW	So, if it’s a ghost, then we’re talking about a dead kid?
BUFFY	I suppose so. Willow, why don’t you compile a list of kids who’ve died here who might have turned into ghosts.
XANDER	We’re on a Hellmouth. It’s gonna be a long list.
WILLOW	Have you seen the “In Memoriam” section in the yearbook?
GILES	I’ll research all the possibilities, ghosts included. Xander, may I count on your help there?
XANDER	What, there’s homework now? How does that happen?
BUFFY	It’s all part of the glamorous world of vampire slaying.
XANDER	Well, what are you going to be doing?
BUFFY	Finding out what I can about Mitch. This attack wasn’t random.
XANDER	Well, I think I should do that part.
BUFFY	Fine. Ask around. Talk to his friends. Talk to Cordelia.
XANDER	Talk to Cordelia? So, research, huh?
HARMONY	Cordelia! You weren’t in fifth period --
CORDELIA	I went to the hospital.
HARMONY	Mitch. How is he? Will he be OK?
CORDELIA	The doctor said he’s fine, he’ll be sent home tomorrow. Oh, you should have seen him -- lying there, all black and blue... How’s he going to look in our prom pictures? How will I ever be able to show them to anyone?
HARMONY	They can do wonderful things with airbrushes these days...
CORDELIA	You think?
CORDELIA	Did you see Mitch? He broke up with Wendy like eight seconds ago and he’s already nosing around.
HARMONY	It’s shameless.
CORDELIA	In the spring, if he makes varsity baseball, maybe I’ll take him on a test-drive...
CORDELIA	Oh, great.
HARMONY	Why is she always --
HARMONY	My ankle -- I think it’s broken...
BUFFY	What happened?
SNYDER	Hey! Who’s the principal here? What happened?
CORDELIA	She just fell! We were coming down the stairs and she just fell! All by herself!
HARMONY	No, I was pushed!
WILLOW	Dead kids.
BUFFY	Yikes.
WILLOW	I was gonna pull up “missing” too, but I didn’t have enough time.
XANDER	What’s the word on Harmony?
GILES	I believe it was a compound fracture. Not wonderful fun.
XANDER	This is a fairly testy ghost we’ve got.
BUFFY	Maybe.
XANDER	You think “Testy” is too strong a word? ‘Cause I felt I was understating --
BUFFY	Giles, have you ever touched a ghost?
GILES	No I haven’t. I’ve seen one, in Dartmoor. A murdered countess, very beautiful. She used to float along the foothills, moaning the most piteous -- I’ve gone away again, haven’t I?
WILLOW	It’s funny when he does that.
BUFFY	We were talking about touching.
GILES	Yes. Well, from what I’ve read, having a ghost pass through you is a singular experience. It’s a cold, amorphous feeling, makes your hair stand up.
BUFFY	Okay, this is my problem. I touched the thing. It didn’t go through me, it bumped into me. And it wasn’t cold.
XANDER	So that means, what -- that we’re talking about an invisible person?
BUFFY	A girl. She spoke. She said Harmony deserved what she got.
GILES	A girl on campus with the power to turn invisible.
XANDER	Man, that is so cool.
WILLOW	Cool?
XANDER	I’d give anything to be able to turn invisible. (off their looks) Well I wouldn’t be beating people up. I’d use my power to protect the girl’s locker room.
GILES	It probably is having an awfully heady experience, having that ability.
WILLOW	So how’d she get it? Is she a witch? ‘Cause we can fight a witch.
XANDER	Greek myths talk about cloaks of invisibility, but they’re usually just for the gods. Research boy comes through with the knowledge.
BUFFY	This girl’s sort of petty, for a God.
WILLOW	She’s got a grudge. But why Harmony?
XANDER	Harmony and Mitch. And the common denominator there --
BUFFY	Is Cordelia.
WILLOW	So what now?
BUFFY	First thing tomorrow, pull up that missing kids list. Maybe this girl’s made herself invisible for long enough for someone to notice she’s gone.
WILLOW	Got it. I’ll see you then.
BUFFY	Good.
XANDER	See ya.
GILES	I’ll start looking into ways to decloak an invisible someone. And you?
BUFFY	I think Cordelia’s gonna be working on the May Queen decorations. There might be some action. It’s time for me to start the hunt.
GILES	And how exactly do you propose to hunt someone you can’t see?
ANGEL	Don’t worry. I’m not here to eat.
GILES	Buffy told me you don’t feed on humans anymore.
ANGEL	Not for a long while.
GILES	Is that why you’re here? To see her?
ANGEL	I can’t. It’s it’s too hard for me to be around her.
GILES	A vampire in love with the Slayer. It’s rather poetic, in a maudlin sort of way. Well, what can I do for you?
ANGEL	I know you’ve been researching the Master.
GILES	The Vampire King. Yes, I’m trying to learn all I can about him. For the day when Buffy must face him. I haven’t learned much, I’m afraid.
ANGEL	Things I’ve heard lately from -- Things you wouldn’t care to meet -- Something’s already in motion -- something big -- but I don’t know what. You’ve read all the Slayer lore there is, right?
GILES	I’ve studied all the extant volumes, of course. But the most important books of Slayer prophecy have been lost. The Tiberius Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex.
ANGEL	The Codex.
GILES	It was reputed to contain the most complete prophecies about the Slayer’s role in the End Times. But the book was lost in the 15th century.
ANGEL	Not lost. Misplaced. I can get it.
GILES	That would be very helpful. My own volumes seem to be useless of late.
ANGEL	Legends of Vishnu?
GILES	Oh, there’s an invisible girl terrorizing the school.
ANGEL	Oh. That’s not really my area of expertise.
GILES	Nor mine, I’m afraid. It’s fascinating, though. By all accounts a wonderful power to have.
ANGEL	I don’t know. Looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there...
CORDELIA	God, I am never sitting through one of those alumni lectures again. Two hours of “My Treck Though Nepal”. Hello! There’s nobody caring.
MARCIE	Did you see his toupee? It looked like a cabbage.
CORDELIA	And those slides. “That’s a mountain. Yes, that’s a mountain too. Now let’s look at some mountains.”
HARMONY	I swear he only had three slides and he just used them over and over.
MARCIE	Did you guys notice his toupee --
HARMONY	We’re talking, okay?
CORDELIA	Oh! And did you guys check out the extreme toupee? Yeah, that’s realistic. Looked like a cabbage.
BUFFY	Did you guys just hear something?
XANDER	Just the hiss of hot air.
XANDER	Giles said you’d be here. Why are you being here?
BUFFY	Last night was a bust. But I still think Cordy’s the key here.
WILLOW	The missing girls list. They’ve mostly stayed missing. I pulled their classes, activities, medical records...
BUFFY	Good work.
BUFFY	Whoa, check it out. the most recent one. Marcie Ross... disappeared almost six months ago.
XANDER	I don’t know her.
WILLOW	Me neither.
BUFFY	Well, her only activity was band. She played the flute.
WILLOW	So?
BUFFY	I heard a flute last night, when I was hunting. I couldn’t find out where it was coming from.
XANDER	What did it sound like?
BUFFY	Sad. Real sad. But it was the band room where I lost Ms. Invisible yesterday... This tracks. I’ve got a free now, I’ll check it out.
XANDER	OK, we’ll see you after geometry.
CORDELIA	Are you okay? What happened?
MILLER	Attacked.. Didn’t see...
WILLOW	“Have a nice summer.” “Have a nice summer....” This girl had no friends at all .
GILES	Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generation gap.
BUFFY	“Have a nice summer” is what you write when you have nothing to say.
XANDER	It’s the kiss of death.
BUFFY	And you guys didn’t know Marcie Ross?
XANDER	Never met her, why?
BUFFY	‘Cause you both wrote it too.
XANDER	“Have a nice --” yeeesh.
WILLOW	Where am I? Oh. “Have a great summer.” See, I cared.
BUFFY	But you don’t remember her.
XANDER	Well, we probably didn’t see her except to sign the book, this is a big school --
WILLOW	Xander, we each had four classes with her last year!
BUFFY	And you never noticed her. And now she’s invisible...
XANDER	What, she turned invisible because no one noticed her?
GILES	Of course! ...
GILES	I’ve been investigating mystical causes of invisibility when I should have looked to the quantum mechanical ! Physics. Reality is shaped, even created by our perception of it.
BUFFY	And with the Hellmouth below us sending out mystical energy --
GILES	People perceived Marcie as invisible, and she became so.
XANDER	But people perceived the whole Marcie package as invisible, clothes and all, not just, you know... (what’s bothering him) So you’re saying she’s not naked.
BUFFY	It isn’t this great power she can control, it’s something that was done to her. That we did to her.
WILLOW	No wonder she’s miffed. But what does she want?
BUFFY	Cordelia.
CORDELIA	I knew I’d find you here.
XANDER	A-and you would be wanting what?
CORDELIA	Buffy, I, uh, know we’ve had our difference, you being so weird and all, and hanging out with these, ugh, total losers, and... Well anyway, despite all that, I know you share this feeling we have for each other, deep down...
WILLOW	Nausea?
CORDELIA	Somebody’s after me! Someone just tried to kill Ms. Miller! She was helping me with my homework! And Mitch and Harmony...! This is all about me! Me! Me! Me!
XANDER	Wow. For once she’s right.
BUFFY	So you’re coming to me for help? There’s a Why? inside me screaming to get out.
CORDELIA	I don’t know... because you’re always around when stuff happens, I know you’re strong and you got those weapons... I was kind of hoping you’re in a gang.
WILLOW	The Ugh- Total -Losers Gang.
CORDELIA	Please... I don’t know where else to turn.
GILES	Please sit down Do you know... I don’t recall ever seeing you here before.
CORDELIA	Oh, no. I have a life.
BUFFY	Cordelia, the attacker is an invisible girl.
XANDER	Who is really, really angry at you. I can’t imagine that, personally, but it takes all kinds, you know?
CORDELIA	I don’t care what it is, just get rid of it!
BUFFY	It’s not that simple. It’s a
CORDELIA	God, is she wearing Laura Ashley ?
WILLOW	So homicidal?
MILLER	Cordelia.
CORDELIA	Well, just because the story’s about him doesn’t mean he’s necessarily the hero, right?
MILLER	Exactly. What would we call him? Willow.
WILLOW	Well, the protagonist.
XANDER	He can’t be both? ‘Cause some of the stuff he does is heroic.
BUFFY	Well, Marcie remembers you.
GILES	According to what you’ve told us about the attack on Ms. Miller, we now have two messages from Marcie: Look and Listen.
WILLOW	messages we don’t understand.
BUFFY	I’m not sure we’re supposed to, yet. Marcie’s not quite ready. From what she did to Cordelia’s picture, I’d say she’s wigged on the whole May Queen thing. Maybe she’s going to do something about it, but at a time of her choosing.
WILLOW	Stop the coronation tonight, maybe. Keep you guys out of the Bronze.
CORDELIA	Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight.
XANDER	Can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?
CORDELIA	If I’m not crowned tonight, then... then Marcie’s won! And that’s bad! She’s evil, okay? Way eviler than me.
BUFFY	She has a point.
CORDELIA	Buffy’s with me on this.
BUFFY	Anyway, continuing the normal May Queen activities is probably the best way to draw Marcie out. Cordelia is our bait.
CORDELIA	Great! What?
GILES	Willow and Xander will help me begin our research anew.
XANDER	He can just say that and then we have to.
GILES	Unless we can find a way to cure Macie’s invisibility, Buffy will be --
BUFFY	A sitting duck Come on.
CORDELIA	I need to try on my dress. Am I really bait?
CORDELIA	And she turned invisible ‘cause she’s so unpopular? Bummer for her.
BUFFY	That about sums it up.
CORDELIA	It’s awful to feel that lonely.
BUFFY	Oh, so you’ve read about that feeling?
BUFFY	If you feel so alone, why do you work so hard to be popular?
CORDELIA	Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.
XANDER	So what’s the answer, Mr. Wizard? Potion, ritual, really silly spell requiring you to shout things?
WILLOW	Right, how do we make Marcie visible?
GILES	We don’t.
WILLOW	You mean... it’s permanent?
GILES	I mean apparently gift as a researcher is limited to supernatural rather than quantum phenomena. All these state functions, observables... Mathematics was never my strength.
WILLOW	Ssssh! Listen!
GILES	Perhaps we can talk to her, reason with her. (off their reactions) Or possibly grab her.
WILLOW	There are three of us...
XANDER	Let’s go!
CORDELIA	If you ever tell anyone I changed in a mop closet...
BUFFY	Your secret dies with me.
GILES	Marcie. We know what has happened to you. Please talk to us.
WILLOW	We’re so sorry we ignored you.
WILLOW	Does anybody else feel like a major idiot?
GILES	What’s that sound?
BUFFY	You know, what you were saying before... I understand. It doesn’t matter how popular you are --
CORDELIA	You were popular? In what alternate universe?
BUFFY	In L.A. That point is, I did sort of feel like something was missing --
CORDELIA	Is that when you became weird and got kicked out?
BUFFY	Okay, can we have the heartfelt talk with less talk from you? Cordelia?
GILES	She’s snuffed out the pilot light! The gas is up full, but I can’t find the shutoff!
XANDER	Is this it?
CORDELIA	Buffy? You’re awake?
BUFFY	Yeah.
CORDELIA	I can’t move.
BUFFY	Neither can I.
CORDELIA	I can’t feel my face.
BUFFY	What do you mean?
CORDELIA	My face! It feels numb. What is she doing?
BUFFY	I don’t know.
CORDELIA	What does that mean ?
WILLOW	Why is Marcie doing this?
GILES	The isolation, the exile she’s endured... she has gone mad.
XANDER	Ya think ?
VOICE	I’m disappointed. I really hoped you would have figured it out by now.
BUFFY	Why don’t you explain it? What are we supposed to learn?
CORDELIA	Yeah, what do you want to teach us?
VOICE	No, you don’t get it. You’re not the student. You’re the lesson.
CORDELIA	What have you done to my face?
VOICE	Your face. That’s what it’s all about, isn’t it? Your beautiful face. That’s what makes you shine just a little bit brighter than the rest of us. We all want what you have. To be noticed. To be remembered. To be seen.
CORDELIA	What are you doing?
VOICE	I’m fulfilling your fondest wish.
XANDER	I’m thinking we ram the door and take our chances.
WILLOW	What’re a few sparks among friends?
GILES	Sparks... Sparks are caused by metal on metal...
BUFFY	Marcie... you can’t do this.
VOICE	What are you gonna do? Slay me?
BUFFY	Marcie, you know it’s wrong...
VOICE	You should have stayed out of my way. You know, I actually thought you might understand my vision. But you’re just like them. Maybe I’ll practice on you. A little warm up. This is my first operation, after all.
CORDELIA	Please don’t do this...
CORDELIA	Noo...
VOICE	You should be grateful. People who pass you in the street will remember you for the rest of their ‘lives. Children will dream bout you. And every one of your friends who comes to the coronation tonight will take the sight of the May Queen to their graves.
CORDELIA	Wait!
VOICE	We really have to get started. That local anesthetic will be wearing off soon. And I don’t want you to faint. It’s less fun if you’re not awake.
VOICE	Let’s see... I think we should start with your smile. I think it should be wider.
CORDELIA	Marcie... listen... you think I don’t understand what you’re going through, but I do.
VOICE	You will...
CORDELIA	I do... and I could help you. I could. Help you meet people. Everyone could want to know you now... I mean you’re really special.
CORDELIA	Oh, God, get me out of here...
BUFFY	Just hold still -
XANDER	What happened?
ANGEL	You tell me.
WILLOW	I’m up, mom...
XANDER	Hi. What do you want?
ANGEL	I brought you the codex. I came in through the basement, smelled the gas.
GILES	We’ve still got to turn it off, or it could blow the building.
ANGEL	I’ll do it. It’s not like I need the oxygen...
DOYLE	FBI! Nobody move!
MANETTI	We’ll take it from here, ma’am.
BUFFY	Take what from where?
DOYLE	I’m agent Doyle, this is agent Manetti. We’re here for the girl.
BUFFY	Well, where were you ten minutes ago when she was playing surgeon?
DOYLE	I’m sorry, we came as fast as we could. We’ll take care of it from here on.
BUFFY	You can cure her?
DOYLE	We can... rehabilitate her.
MANETTI	In time she’ll learn to be a useful member of society again.
DOYLE	Very useful.
BUFFY	This isn’t the first time this has happened, is it? This has happened at other schools.
MANETTI	We’re not at liberty to discuss that.
DOYLE	It would be best for you to forget this whole incident.
BUFFY	Do you guys know that you’re very creepy?
DOYLE	Thank you for your help.
GILES	Janitor. Found us and shut off the valve.
WILLOW	We were lucky.
BUFFY	I’ll say.
BUFFY	Hey.
CORDELIA	Hi. Look, I didn’t get a chance to say anything yesterday, with the coronation and everything, but... I guess I wanted to thank you. All of you.
XANDER	It’s funny ‘cause you look like Cordelia.
CORDELIA	You really helped me out, and you didn’t have to. So thanks.
BUFFY	That’s okay.
WILLOW	Listen, we’re just going to grab some lunch, if you wanted --
MITCH	Whoah, you’re not hanging with these losers, you?
CORDELIA	Are you kidding? I was just being charitable, trying to help them with their fashion problems.
DOYLE	We think you’ll be happy here.
MANETTI	You should fit right in.

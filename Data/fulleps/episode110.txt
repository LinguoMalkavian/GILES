DAWN	What time is it?
TARA	Almost seven. God, I just closed my eyes for a minute-
DAWN	-and now there's cartoons. (shifts uncomfortably) Plus, I have the mother of all-night wedgies.
TARA	Uh oh.
DAWN	It's not tragic. I'm sure as soon as I stand up-
TARA	No, Dawn - why didn't anyone wake us up? Where is everyone?
DAWN	Willow didn't come home either. They were out all night. Where are they?
TARA	I'm sure they're fine, Dawny. I'm sure they just... lost track of time.
BUFFY	When... When did the building fall down?
SPIKE	Dunno. Musta been sometime between the first time and the...
BUFFY	Oh. Oh my God.
BUFFY	Shoe. I need my shoe.
SPIKE	What's the hurry, luv?
BUFFY	The hurry is, I left Dawn all night and don't call me "luv."
SPIKE	Didn't seem to take issue with it last night. Or with any of the other little nasties we whispered.
BUFFY	Can we - not? Talk?
SPIKE	I just don't see why you have to run off so quick. I thought we could...
SPIKE	Don't say that.
BUFFY	What do you think is going to happen, Spike? We're gonna read the paper together? Play footsie under the... rubble?
SPIKE	Not exactly what I had in mind.
BUFFY	Stop-
SPIKE	Make me.
BUFFY	No. No. I have to...
SPIKE	Stay. I'm stuck here. Sun's up.
BUFFY	Oh, God...
SPIKE	I knew. I knew - the only thing better than killing a slayer would be fuc-
BUFFY	What? That's what this was about? "Doing" a slayer?
SPIKE	Wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
BUFFY	Shut up-
BUFFY	No. A vampire got me hot. One . But he's gone. You're just convenient.
SPIKE	Before you go voicing any more of your theories, you might do well to remember that I can hurt you now.
BUFFY	Right. Because I came back all wrong... Know what's really wrong with me? You.
SPIKE	So, what? You go back to treating me like dirt until the next time you get an itch you can't scratch?
SPIKE	Bullocks. It was a bloody revelation. You can act as high and mighty as you like, but I know where you live now, Slayer. I tasted it.
BUFFY	Get a grip, Spike. Like you're God's gift-
SPIKE	Hardly. Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?
BUFFY	Let me go-
SPIKE	I may be dirt, but you're the one who wants to roll in it, slayer. You never had it so good as me. Never.
BUFFY	You're bent-
SPIKE	Yeah. And it made you scream, didn't it?
BUFFY	I swear, if you ever tell anyone about this, I will kill you .
SPIKE	Right.
TARA	Pancakes?
DAWN	Uh, sure. Should we call Xander? What if they're all in a ditch somewhere? Ditches are bad. Mom always used to talk about the ditches-
TARA	Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but let's give it a little more time before we wake them up. Funny shapes or-
AMY	...that last guy, I couldn't believe what you did. How's he going to eat?
WILLOW	It'll probably wear off in a day or-
TARA	Hey. I just... Buffy didn't come home. Either. So...
WILLOW	Oh. Hey! This is Amy. Amy, Tara. Tara, Amy.
AMY	How you doing?
TARA	Fine. I... I'd better g-get going.
WILLOW	Amy. Amy the rat . Sorry.
AMY	No. That's fair. I was a rat.
TARA	When...
AMY	Last night. It's nuts. Everything's so different. I mean, the Bronze for one thing... And Willow! She's a freakin' amazing witch now. I couldn't keep up with her last night-
WILLOW	Amy-
AMY	It's true. I mean, I can do some transmogrify, but she's messing with dimensions and everything. It was awesome. This blowhard dude? First she made his mouth disappear, thank God, and- -I'm talking too much. Sorry. But it's just, you know, been me and a bag of pellets for the last few years so-
TARA	No. It's fine. It's just... I really do have to go.
WILLOW	Tara, wait, you left some clothes and stuff. I saved them for-
TARA	I'll get them later.
WILLOW	Tara-
DAWN	Buffy! Where were you? Are you okay?
BUFFY	I'm fine-
DAWN	You're not. You're all limpy and sore-
BUFFY	I'm not. Sore. I just had a... fight, all-nighter kind of deal.
DAWN	Figured. I knew that's why you didn't call. So what's the big bad? Should we be worried?
BUFFY	No. I think you guys are safe. Tara was here.
WILLOW	I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
BUFFY	You guess? Where were you?
WILLOW	We were out. We kinda lost track of time and...
BUFFY	Oh.
WILLOW	I mean, I never would have if we thought you weren't coming home-
BUFFY	No, I know. It's... I mean, it wasn't intentional. And everybody's safe. You are, right? You're okay?
DAWN	Yeah. I mean, I think my pancakes are burning, but-
WILLOW	I - I've got to get some sleep.
BUFFY	Me too. I'm kind of...
AMY	Yeah. I should get home. Dad's expecting me. He promised to save me a bunch of melon rinds and stuff for breakfast. (off their looks) Kidding.
WILLOW	Okay. I'll call you later?
BUFFY	You sure you're alright? I'm sorry. About everything.
DAWN	It's okay. Go get some rest. You're beat from monster wrestling all night.
BUFFY	Right. Thanks.
WILLOW	Yeah. I'm going to crash too. Night Dawny.
DAWN	No problem. I'll just... go find some awake people.
WILLOW	Claudete. WILLOW Close.
XANDER	These demons are all starting to look alike. Reptile, reptile with horn, reptile with gills...
ANYA	Hmmmmm.
XANDER	And I'm still finding nothing of the "steal a diamond, freeze a guy" variety. Ayn. Hand me that one next to you.
ANYA	I'm sorry, but this is pointless! We've been researching forever and we're not even close to finding out who robbed that museum-
BUFFY	What's up?
XANDER	Anya's got a theory. Martha Stewart froze that guy-
XANDER	Please, as if she- Really?
ANYA	Of course. Nobody can do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness-
BUFFY	Hey. This is fascinating, really, but we've got work to do-
ANYA	I certainly do. I still haven't decided whether to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses or the traditional burlap and blood larva-
XANDER	The traditional what?
ANYA	I was a demon for a thousand years, Xander. You can't just expect me to turn my back on all the ways of my people-
BUFFY	Can I weigh in on the whole me wearing of larva-
XANDER	No!
ANYA	At least I'm not asking you to perform the groom's rite of self- flagellation-
BUFFY	Guys! Please. There's something out there-
XANDER	There is. And much as I hate to admit that my bizarre bride-to-be has a point - we're getting nowhere, Buff. Maybe it's time to try something new. Hit the streets. Get Spike on it-
BUFFY	No. No Spike. And we don't need to hit streets. We just need to stay put, away from... distractions. We'll figure it out.
ANYA	What about Willow? Can't she do something?
BUFFY	Maybe, but she's home sleeping.
XANDER	Sleeping? She sick?
BUFFY	She was out late. With Amy.
ANYA	And I'm bizarre? At least I didn't dump you to hang out with an ex-rat.
BUFFY	It's not like that. Willow's just... trying to help Amy through the transition-
XANDER	And make herself a new playmate to do magic with. Someone who won't monitor her, like Tara-
BUFFY	Willow's a grown up. Maybe she shouldn't be monitored-
XANDER	So you think Tara was wrong? To leave-
BUFFY	I didn't say that, I just...
XANDER	Not judgey, Buff. Just observey.
ANYA	Yeah. All we're saying is - she's acting different. She isn't herself.
AMY	God, I'm so glad you called. I had to get out of the house.
WILLOW	Already? So, things with your dad...
AMY	Bizarre. I guess after I disappeared he just decided to start over. He's, like, this new guy with a new wife and a new baby. And I'm this reminder of all his old stuff.
WILLOW	What did you tell him? I mean, about where you were?
AMY	I didn't think he'd buy the rat thing, so I told him I got abducted by aliens. Kidding! God, what's up? Did sarcasm die while I was a rodent?
WILLOW	Sorry. It's just, I guess I didn't expect you to be in a jokey mood.
AMY	I want to have fun, Willow. I've been in a cage .
WILLOW	There was a little ball. And you seemed to enjoy playing with those cardboard toilet paper rolls-
AMY	As cages go, it was fine. But I was still confined. I've got lost time to make up - and if people don't get it, screw them.
WILLOW	Well, I do. Get it. Totally.
AMY	So what do you want to do? Gonna be hard to top last night.
WILLOW	Yeah, I don't even think I can. I felt awful today. And I couldn't do magic. It took all day for my powers to come back... We should probably take it easy.
AMY	I've got a better idea.
WILLOW	What?
AMY	There's this guy. He knows spells that last for days. And the burn-out factor is, like, nothing.
WILLOW	Really? He's a warlock?
AMY	I guess. But I'm not kidding you, this guy will blow your mind. He'll take you places you can't even imagine.
WILLOW	Is it dangerous?
AMY	Would that stop you?
AMY	This is it.
WILLOW	Where? I thought you said the guy lived around here.
AMY	He does. You can't feel it?
WILLOW	What do you-
AMY	Here.
WILLOW	It's... hot.
AMY	Come on.
AMY	Isn't that cool? His place is cloaked.
WILLOW	Yeah..
AMY	Moves all the time, too. Keeps Rack out of trouble.
WILLOW	Rack? Whose-
GIRL	Rack, it's my turn-
GUY	No, man, you said I was up-
GIRL	Bull! I've been here for hours-
RACK	I believe these two were next.
AMY	Thanks, Rack, for taking us. I know it's been a while. You'll never believe-
RACK	You were a rat.
AMY	How did you-
RACK	Hope it taught you not to mess with spells you can't handle. You should leave that in the hands of a professional.
WILLOW	I don't mean to. Vibe at you. If it's in a negative way-
RACK	I mean you have power, girl. Coming off you in waves.
WILLOW	Not so much. I mean, I can do stuff. But I get tapped out quick. And I've used practically every spell I know-
RACK	And what do you want me to do about it?
WILLOW	I don't know. I thought... Amy said-
RACK	Amy said I could help you - but did she say how you could help me ?
WILLOW	No. I have money, a little, but-
RACK	Not money.
WILLOW	Well maybe I could help you with your computer. I'm pretty handy with-
RACK	Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. But you have to give a little to get a little, right?
AMY	It's okay. It's over fast.
RACK	That's right. I'm just going to take a little tour.
DAWN	Ow, ow, ow-
DAWN	Spatulas are for wimps. I'm making peanut butter and banana quesadillas. You want?
WILLOW	No thanks. I'm more in water mode.
DAWN	Ow, ow... You sure? It's my own brand new invention.
WILLOW	I'm sure. My tummy's feeling a little rumbly.
DAWN	Yorrr losshh. Very deelshioush... Buffy called. She's going straight from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.
WILLOW	Oh. Did she need help?
DAWN	No, she was just checking in. For, like, the tenth time today. I think she's feeling all Joan Crawford 'cause of last night.
WILLOW	About that... I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here.
DAWN	Right. Assume and make "u" an "ASS" out of "ME". Or... something. Anyway. Please. It's cool. I mean, it's not like I even needed Tara to stay with me. I'm so totally fine being here on my own. But you are going to be around tonight, right?
WILLOW	Right. Totally. We could do something if you want. A movie maybe.
DAWN	Really? I thought you weren't feeling so good.
WILLOW	Nothing a little Dawny time won't fix. If you feel like bagging the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner.
DAWN	Thank God. Remind me to never invent that again
WILLOW	Great. This'll be great. I'll just grab the paper, see what's playing.
DAWN	I'll leave a note for Buffy on the refrigerator. It's the first place she goes when she gets home from patrolling. She's such a pig after she kills things.
BUFFY	Hello?
BUFFY	Willow? Dawn?
BUFFY	What are you doing here-
AMY	Uh oh. Busted.
BUFFY	Where's Willow?
AMY	She said... She said I could-
BUFFY	What is this?
AMY	It's not what you think it is. It's sage.
BUFFY	That is what I think it is. What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?
AMY	Willow. I saw her, but that was before- I like your top. When does the Slayer find time to shop?
BUFFY	So they didn't let you in.
AMY	Not that they know of.
BUFFY	What else did you take?
AMY	Nothing-
BUFFY	What else?
AMY	Please, please... I need this stuff. Willow wants me to have it. She understands-
BUFFY	Understands what? Breaking into people's houses for kitchen spices? I don't think so.
AMY	You should. She's as bad as me. Worse. I bet she's at Rack's right now.
BUFFY	Rack's.
AMY	A place. He does spells. Heavy stuff. Willow's his new favorite.
BUFFY	She's there? With Dawn?
AMY	Don't shake me again, super strength. I think I'm going to boot.
BUFFY	Tell me where this place is and I won't.
AMY	Downtown. But it moves.
BUFFY	What do you mean "it moves?"
AMY	It's downtown... I don't know where it would be tonight, exactly.
BUFFY	So how do I find it?
AMY	You kinda have to feel it out... Oh, God. I really am gonna be...
WILLOW	So the burger was okay? You liked it?
DAWN	Are you kidding? It was like a meat party in my mouth- Okay. I'm just a kid and I know that came out wrong. It was good. You should have had something.
WILLOW	I will. I'll eat. I'm saving myself for popcorn.
DAWN	Which other day? Give me a Mon or a Fri, here. Something to work with.
DAWN	Oh. Yeah. I mean, it was nice - but it wasn't a laugh riot. She's sad and everything.
WILLOW	She is?
DAWN	Sure she is. You both are, aren't you?
WILLOW	Of course. You can't be close to someone like that and not be... But it was all for the best, I think.
DAWN	Right. Sure. But I still keep thinking of you guys back together, you know? I mean, I know she misses you.
WILLOW	She does? Did she say something?
DAWN	Not exactly. I could just tell, by the way she was acting.
WILLOW	Oh.
DAWN	Are you sure you're okay? You look a little...
WILLOW	No. I'm fine. And Tara's in her new place? Settled and everything?
DAWN	We didn't really get into it-
WILLOW	Yeah... I kind of took you the long way around, but we're almost there...
DAWN	What is this place? Why is it hidden?
WILLOW	I don't know. But it's cool, isn't it? Now, you just hang here for a minute and I'll be right back. You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?
DAWN	What about the movie? It starts at nine.
WILLOW	We'll make it. I mean, it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers.
DAWN	I like the trailers.
RACK	What do you think, Strawberry? Can you handle some more?
BUFFY	God. Do you sleep through anything? I was, like, yelling, and nothing-
SPIKE	I'm a bit knackered. Had a long night. Someone should teach you how to use candles in foreplay, luv-
BUFFY	Get dressed. Dawn's missing.
SPIKE	Again? You ever think of a Lojack for the girl? What's the story?
BUFFY	She went out with Willow-
SPIKE	Willow... Kind of a sorry excuse to come 'round. You want the touch, all you need to do is-
BUFFY	Spike. Willow's into something. She and Dawn have been missing for hours. There's some guy called Rack-
SPIKE	Rack?
BUFFY	He's some kind of-
SPIKE	I know who he is. He deals in magic. Black stuff. Dangerous.
BUFFY	I've been all over downtown and I can't find his place-
SPIKE	Because he cloaks it. You can't feel it unless you're into the big bad. A witch or a vampire or-
BUFFY	So let's go.
SPIKE	That's right. Hide your blushing eyes.
GUY	Hey! Wait your turn.
WILLOW	Hey, Dawny! Come on, it's movie time-
DAWN	Do you know how long I've been out here? It's too late for the movie- -and that guy smells like foot -
WILLOW	I'm fine. Let's get out of here.
WILLOW	So what do you want to do, cutey?
DAWN	It's late. I just want to go home.
WILLOW	No way. I said we were going to have fun. We are going to have fun.
DAWN	I'm serious. I think we should get out of here.
WILLOW	"I think we should get out of here." It's grown up time, Dawny. You want to play with the grown ups or not?
DAWN	Why are you acting this way?
WILLOW	Oh, God. Don't get all weird. We're fine. Everything's fine.
BUFFY	Anything?
SPIKE	Not yet. Maybe I'd pick up on it if you stopped asking every two seconds.
BUFFY	I swear to God, Spike, if you're dragging this out-
SPIKE	What? So I can linger near your precious self? Get a grip-
BUFFY	Like you've never drawn things out before-
SPIKE	Maybe. But we've been over this, haven't we? Things have changed.
BUFFY	Will you quit with that! The only thing different is that I'm disgusted with myself. That's the power of your charms. The other night was the most perverse, degrading experience of my life-
SPIKE	Yeah. Me too.
BUFFY	Well maybe you get off on it, but it's not my style-
SPIKE	No, it's your calling . Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.
BUFFY	Not love-
SPIKE	Not yet. But I'm in your system now. You're going to crave me like I crave blood. And the next time you come calling, if you don't stop being such a bitch, maybe I will bite you.
BUFFY	I want you out of my life, Spike. Out of my work, my house-
SPIKE	Too late for that. You already invited me in. And as for work... you need me. Like tonight-
BUFFY	Forget it. I'll find Dawn myself-
SPIKE	You really going to put your little sis in danger, just to spite me?
DAWN	Willow, I'm serious, I'm going home.
WILLOW	So go. God, I thought we were going to hang-
DAWN	You're not coming with me?
WILLOW	I don't know. Maybe I could just... pop you back?
DAWN	With magic?
DAWN	Ilm getting out of here.
WILLOW	Dawny. Don't. It's a cat or a-
DAWN	Seems real. Very, very-
MANDRAZ	You summon me, witch?
MANDRAZ	Did. You raised hell with your majiks...
WILLOW	Don't. Don't hurt her. She has nothing to do with this. It was me-
MANDRAZ	Yes. But I pick who dies.
DAWN	He's coming! He's too fast!
WILLOW	Get in!
WILLOW	Operi! WILLOW Shut!
WILLOW	Age . WILLOW Drive .
WILLOW	Yes!
DAWN	Oh! God...
BUFFY	Dawn!
DAWN	He was after Willow. She made the car drive, and, and-
BUFFY	Your arm. Let me see-
DAWN	Don't! Don't touch it-
WILLOW	Oh God, Dawn, there's blood-
BUFFY	Okay. Come on, let's get you to a doctor-
WILLOW	Is she okay? Is she okay?
BUFFY	Back off, Will. We've got her-
WILLOW	No, you're okay - right Dawn? I mean-
BUFFY	I mean it. Stay away ifrom her.
WILLOW	Dawny, Dawny - I'm so sorry. It was an accident. I just - I didn't see. I'm so, so sorry...
BUFFY	Get up.
WILLOW	I screwed it up. Everything. Tara...
BUFFY	Yeah, you screwed up! You could have killed her! You almost did-
WILLOW	I know, I know- I can't stop, Buffy. I tried, and I can't.
BUFFY	You can.
WILLOW	I can't. Please help me. Oh, God, I need help...
WILLOW	Is she okay?
BUFFY	Sleeping. The ER doc gave her something for the pain. It knocked her out.
WILLOW	But she's going to be alright?
BUFFY	It's a fracture. It takes time, but...
BUFFY	I just - I don't understand. Why you'd go to somebody like Rack. And why you'd drag Dawn into it.
WILLOW	I didn't mean to. I wasn't going to... We were just going to the movies.
BUFFY	So what happened?
WILLOW	I don't know. The magic. I thought I had it under control. And then... I didn't.
BUFFY	Why? Because of Tara?
WILLOW	No. It started before she left. It's why she left.
BUFFY	But everything seemed to be going so well...
WILLOW	It was... But, I mean, if you could be plain old Willow - or Super Willow? Who would you want to be? I guess you don't actually have the option on the whole "super" thing.
BUFFY	Will, there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need magic to be special-
WILLOW	Don't I? Buffy, who was I? Just some girl. Tara didn't even know that girl...
BUFFY	You were more than "some girl". And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you-
WILLOW	We don't know that-
BUFFY	I know that. I promise you.
WILLOW	It just, it took me away from myself. I felt so... free.
BUFFY	I get that. More than you... But it's wrong. People get hurt.
WILLOW	If something had happened to Dawn tonight, something worse...
BUFFY	I know.
WILLOW	I don't think you do. I was out of my mind. I did things... I can't even...
BUFFY	Good. I think it's right. To give it up. No matter how great it feels-
WILLOW	It's not worth it. Not if it messes with the people I love. I mean, it'll be hard. But I can do it. I know I can.
BUFFY	Hard - but not impossible. We'll be here for each other.
WILLOW	Totally. And magic wasn't all great. I mean, I won't miss the nose bleeds and the headaches and stuff.
BUFFY	Right.
WILLOW	Or keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra. (off Buffy's look) Don't ask.
BUFFY	Well, see, I don't have to now.
WILLOW	'Cause it's over.
BUFFY	Exactly. It's over. From now on it's goodbye impulse - hello impulse control.
TARA	Almost seven. God, I just closed my eyes for a minute-
DAWN	-and now there's cartoons. (shifts uncomfortably) Plus, I have the mother of all-night wedgies.
TARA	Uh oh.
DAWN	It's not tragic. I'm sure as soon as I stand up-
TARA	No, Dawn - why didn't anyone wake us up? Where is everyone?
BUFFY	When... When did the building fall down?
SPIKE	Dunno. Musta been sometime between the first time and the...
BUFFY	Shoe. I need my shoe.
SPIKE	What's the hurry, luv?
BUFFY	The hurry is, I left Dawn all night and don't call me "luv."
SPIKE	Didn't seem to take issue with it last night. Or with any of the other little nasties we whispered.
SPIKE	I just don't see why you have to run off so quick. I thought we could...
SPIKE	Don't say that.
BUFFY	What do you think is going to happen, Spike? We're gonna read the paper together? Play footsie under the... rubble?
BUFFY	Stop-
SPIKE	Make me.
BUFFY	No. No. I have to...
SPIKE	Stay. I'm stuck here. Sun's up.
BUFFY	What? That's what this was about? "Doing" a slayer?
SPIKE	Wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
BUFFY	Shut up-
BUFFY	No. A vampire got me hot. One . But he's gone. You're just convenient.
SPIKE	Before you go voicing any more of your theories, you might do well to remember that I can hurt you now.
BUFFY	Right. Because I came back all wrong... Know what's really wrong with me? You.
SPIKE	Bullocks. It was a bloody revelation. You can act as high and mighty as you like, but I know where you live now, Slayer. I tasted it.
BUFFY	Get a grip, Spike. Like you're God's gift-
BUFFY	Let me go-
SPIKE	I may be dirt, but you're the one who wants to roll in it, slayer. You never had it so good as me. Never.
BUFFY	You're bent-
SPIKE	Yeah. And it made you scream, didn't it?
TARA	Pancakes?
DAWN	Uh, sure. Should we call Xander? What if they're all in a ditch somewhere? Ditches are bad. Mom always used to talk about the ditches-
TARA	Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but let's give it a little more time before we wake them up. Funny shapes or-
AMY	...that last guy, I couldn't believe what you did. How's he going to eat?
WILLOW	It'll probably wear off in a day or-
TARA	Hey. I just... Buffy didn't come home. Either. So...
WILLOW	Oh. Hey! This is Amy. Amy, Tara. Tara, Amy.
AMY	How you doing?
TARA	Fine. I... I'd better g-get going.
WILLOW	Amy. Amy the rat . Sorry.
AMY	No. That's fair. I was a rat.
WILLOW	Amy-
AMY	It's true. I mean, I can do some transmogrify, but she's messing with dimensions and everything. It was awesome. This blowhard dude? First she made his mouth disappear, thank God, and- -I'm talking too much. Sorry. But it's just, you know, been me and a bag of pellets for the last few years so-
TARA	No. It's fine. It's just... I really do have to go.
WILLOW	Tara, wait, you left some clothes and stuff. I saved them for-
TARA	I'll get them later.
BUFFY	I'm fine-
DAWN	You're not. You're all limpy and sore-
BUFFY	I'm not. Sore. I just had a... fight, all-nighter kind of deal.
DAWN	Figured. I knew that's why you didn't call. So what's the big bad? Should we be worried?
BUFFY	No. I think you guys are safe. Tara was here.
WILLOW	I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
BUFFY	You guess? Where were you?
WILLOW	We were out. We kinda lost track of time and...
BUFFY	Oh.
WILLOW	I mean, I never would have if we thought you weren't coming home-
BUFFY	No, I know. It's... I mean, it wasn't intentional. And everybody's safe. You are, right? You're okay?
DAWN	Yeah. I mean, I think my pancakes are burning, but-
WILLOW	I - I've got to get some sleep.
BUFFY	Me too. I'm kind of...
AMY	Yeah. I should get home. Dad's expecting me. He promised to save me a bunch of melon rinds and stuff for breakfast. (off their looks) Kidding.
WILLOW	Okay. I'll call you later?
BUFFY	You sure you're alright? I'm sorry. About everything.
DAWN	It's okay. Go get some rest. You're beat from monster wrestling all night.
XANDER	These demons are all starting to look alike. Reptile, reptile with horn, reptile with gills...
ANYA	Hmmmmm.
XANDER	And I'm still finding nothing of the "steal a diamond, freeze a guy" variety. Ayn. Hand me that one next to you.
ANYA	I'm sorry, but this is pointless! We've been researching forever and we're not even close to finding out who robbed that museum-
BUFFY	What's up?
XANDER	Anya's got a theory. Martha Stewart froze that guy-
XANDER	Please, as if she- Really?
ANYA	Of course. Nobody can do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness-
BUFFY	Hey. This is fascinating, really, but we've got work to do-
ANYA	I certainly do. I still haven't decided whether to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses or the traditional burlap and blood larva-
XANDER	The traditional what?
ANYA	I was a demon for a thousand years, Xander. You can't just expect me to turn my back on all the ways of my people-
BUFFY	Can I weigh in on the whole me wearing of larva-
XANDER	No!
ANYA	At least I'm not asking you to perform the groom's rite of self- flagellation-
BUFFY	Guys! Please. There's something out there-
XANDER	There is. And much as I hate to admit that my bizarre bride-to-be has a point - we're getting nowhere, Buff. Maybe it's time to try something new. Hit the streets. Get Spike on it-
BUFFY	No. No Spike. And we don't need to hit streets. We just need to stay put, away from... distractions. We'll figure it out.
ANYA	What about Willow? Can't she do something?
BUFFY	Maybe, but she's home sleeping.
XANDER	Sleeping? She sick?
BUFFY	She was out late. With Amy.
ANYA	And I'm bizarre? At least I didn't dump you to hang out with an ex-rat.
BUFFY	It's not like that. Willow's just... trying to help Amy through the transition-
XANDER	And make herself a new playmate to do magic with. Someone who won't monitor her, like Tara-
BUFFY	Willow's a grown up. Maybe she shouldn't be monitored-
XANDER	So you think Tara was wrong? To leave-
BUFFY	I didn't say that, I just...
XANDER	Not judgey, Buff. Just observey.
ANYA	Yeah. All we're saying is - she's acting different. She isn't herself.
AMY	God, I'm so glad you called. I had to get out of the house.
WILLOW	Already? So, things with your dad...
AMY	Bizarre. I guess after I disappeared he just decided to start over. He's, like, this new guy with a new wife and a new baby. And I'm this reminder of all his old stuff.
WILLOW	What did you tell him? I mean, about where you were?
AMY	I didn't think he'd buy the rat thing, so I told him I got abducted by aliens. Kidding! God, what's up? Did sarcasm die while I was a rodent?
WILLOW	Sorry. It's just, I guess I didn't expect you to be in a jokey mood.
AMY	I want to have fun, Willow. I've been in a cage .
WILLOW	There was a little ball. And you seemed to enjoy playing with those cardboard toilet paper rolls-
AMY	As cages go, it was fine. But I was still confined. I've got lost time to make up - and if people don't get it, screw them.
WILLOW	Well, I do. Get it. Totally.
AMY	So what do you want to do? Gonna be hard to top last night.
WILLOW	Yeah, I don't even think I can. I felt awful today. And I couldn't do magic. It took all day for my powers to come back... We should probably take it easy.
AMY	I've got a better idea.
WILLOW	What?
AMY	There's this guy. He knows spells that last for days. And the burn-out factor is, like, nothing.
WILLOW	Really? He's a warlock?
AMY	I guess. But I'm not kidding you, this guy will blow your mind. He'll take you places you can't even imagine.
WILLOW	Is it dangerous?
AMY	This is it.
WILLOW	Where? I thought you said the guy lived around here.
AMY	He does. You can't feel it?
WILLOW	What do you-
WILLOW	It's... hot.
AMY	Come on.
AMY	Isn't that cool? His place is cloaked.
WILLOW	Yeah..
AMY	Moves all the time, too. Keeps Rack out of trouble.
WILLOW	Rack? Whose-
GIRL	Rack, it's my turn-
GUY	No, man, you said I was up-
GIRL	Bull! I've been here for hours-
AMY	Thanks, Rack, for taking us. I know it's been a while. You'll never believe-
RACK	You were a rat.
AMY	How did you-
WILLOW	I don't mean to. Vibe at you. If it's in a negative way-
RACK	I mean you have power, girl. Coming off you in waves.
WILLOW	Not so much. I mean, I can do stuff. But I get tapped out quick. And I've used practically every spell I know-
RACK	And what do you want me to do about it?
WILLOW	I don't know. I thought... Amy said-
RACK	Amy said I could help you - but did she say how you could help me ?
WILLOW	No. I have money, a little, but-
RACK	Not money.
WILLOW	Well maybe I could help you with your computer. I'm pretty handy with-
DAWN	Ow, ow, ow-
DAWN	Ow, ow... You sure? It's my own brand new invention.
WILLOW	I'm sure. My tummy's feeling a little rumbly.
DAWN	Yorrr losshh. Very deelshioush... Buffy called. She's going straight from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.
WILLOW	Oh. Did she need help?
DAWN	No, she was just checking in. For, like, the tenth time today. I think she's feeling all Joan Crawford 'cause of last night.
WILLOW	About that... I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here.
WILLOW	Right. Totally. We could do something if you want. A movie maybe.
DAWN	Really? I thought you weren't feeling so good.
WILLOW	Nothing a little Dawny time won't fix. If you feel like bagging the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner.
DAWN	Thank God. Remind me to never invent that again
WILLOW	Great. This'll be great. I'll just grab the paper, see what's playing.
DAWN	I'll leave a note for Buffy on the refrigerator. It's the first place she goes when she gets home from patrolling. She's such a pig after she kills things.
AMY	Uh oh. Busted.
BUFFY	Where's Willow?
AMY	She said... She said I could-
AMY	It's not what you think it is. It's sage.
BUFFY	That is what I think it is. What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?
AMY	Willow. I saw her, but that was before- I like your top. When does the Slayer find time to shop?
BUFFY	So they didn't let you in.
AMY	Not that they know of.
BUFFY	What else did you take?
AMY	Nothing-
BUFFY	What else?
AMY	Please, please... I need this stuff. Willow wants me to have it. She understands-
BUFFY	Understands what? Breaking into people's houses for kitchen spices? I don't think so.
AMY	You should. She's as bad as me. Worse. I bet she's at Rack's right now.
BUFFY	Rack's.
AMY	A place. He does spells. Heavy stuff. Willow's his new favorite.
BUFFY	She's there? With Dawn?
AMY	Don't shake me again, super strength. I think I'm going to boot.
BUFFY	Tell me where this place is and I won't.
AMY	Downtown. But it moves.
BUFFY	What do you mean "it moves?"
AMY	It's downtown... I don't know where it would be tonight, exactly.
BUFFY	So how do I find it?
AMY	You kinda have to feel it out... Oh, God. I really am gonna be...
WILLOW	So the burger was okay? You liked it?
DAWN	Are you kidding? It was like a meat party in my mouth- Okay. I'm just a kid and I know that came out wrong. It was good. You should have had something.
WILLOW	I will. I'll eat. I'm saving myself for popcorn.
DAWN	Which other day? Give me a Mon or a Fri, here. Something to work with.
DAWN	Oh. Yeah. I mean, it was nice - but it wasn't a laugh riot. She's sad and everything.
WILLOW	She is?
DAWN	Sure she is. You both are, aren't you?
WILLOW	Of course. You can't be close to someone like that and not be... But it was all for the best, I think.
DAWN	Right. Sure. But I still keep thinking of you guys back together, you know? I mean, I know she misses you.
WILLOW	She does? Did she say something?
DAWN	Not exactly. I could just tell, by the way she was acting.
WILLOW	Oh.
DAWN	Are you sure you're okay? You look a little...
WILLOW	No. I'm fine. And Tara's in her new place? Settled and everything?
DAWN	We didn't really get into it-
WILLOW	Yeah... I kind of took you the long way around, but we're almost there...
WILLOW	I don't know. But it's cool, isn't it? Now, you just hang here for a minute and I'll be right back. You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?
DAWN	What about the movie? It starts at nine.
SPIKE	Again? You ever think of a Lojack for the girl? What's the story?
BUFFY	She went out with Willow-
SPIKE	Willow... Kind of a sorry excuse to come 'round. You want the touch, all you need to do is-
BUFFY	Spike. Willow's into something. She and Dawn have been missing for hours. There's some guy called Rack-
SPIKE	Rack?
BUFFY	He's some kind of-
SPIKE	I know who he is. He deals in magic. Black stuff. Dangerous.
BUFFY	I've been all over downtown and I can't find his place-
SPIKE	Because he cloaks it. You can't feel it unless you're into the big bad. A witch or a vampire or-
BUFFY	So let's go.
WILLOW	Hey, Dawny! Come on, it's movie time-
DAWN	Do you know how long I've been out here? It's too late for the movie- -and that guy smells like foot -
WILLOW	I'm fine. Let's get out of here.
WILLOW	So what do you want to do, cutey?
DAWN	It's late. I just want to go home.
WILLOW	No way. I said we were going to have fun. We are going to have fun.
DAWN	I'm serious. I think we should get out of here.
WILLOW	"I think we should get out of here." It's grown up time, Dawny. You want to play with the grown ups or not?
DAWN	Why are you acting this way?
WILLOW	Oh, God. Don't get all weird. We're fine. Everything's fine.
BUFFY	Anything?
SPIKE	Not yet. Maybe I'd pick up on it if you stopped asking every two seconds.
BUFFY	I swear to God, Spike, if you're dragging this out-
SPIKE	What? So I can linger near your precious self? Get a grip-
BUFFY	Like you've never drawn things out before-
SPIKE	Maybe. But we've been over this, haven't we? Things have changed.
BUFFY	Will you quit with that! The only thing different is that I'm disgusted with myself. That's the power of your charms. The other night was the most perverse, degrading experience of my life-
SPIKE	Yeah. Me too.
BUFFY	Well maybe you get off on it, but it's not my style-
SPIKE	No, it's your calling . Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.
BUFFY	Not love-
SPIKE	Not yet. But I'm in your system now. You're going to crave me like I crave blood. And the next time you come calling, if you don't stop being such a bitch, maybe I will bite you.
BUFFY	I want you out of my life, Spike. Out of my work, my house-
SPIKE	Too late for that. You already invited me in. And as for work... you need me. Like tonight-
BUFFY	Forget it. I'll find Dawn myself-
SPIKE	You really going to put your little sis in danger, just to spite me?
DAWN	Willow, I'm serious, I'm going home.
WILLOW	So go. God, I thought we were going to hang-
DAWN	You're not coming with me?
WILLOW	I don't know. Maybe I could just... pop you back?
DAWN	With magic?
MANDRAZ	You summon me, witch?
MANDRAZ	Did. You raised hell with your majiks...
DAWN	He was after Willow. She made the car drive, and, and-
BUFFY	Your arm. Let me see-
DAWN	Don't! Don't touch it-
BUFFY	Okay. Come on, let's get you to a doctor-
WILLOW	Is she okay? Is she okay?
WILLOW	No, you're okay - right Dawn? I mean-
BUFFY	I mean it. Stay away ifrom her.
BUFFY	Get up.
WILLOW	I screwed it up. Everything. Tara...
BUFFY	Yeah, you screwed up! You could have killed her! You almost did-
WILLOW	I know, I know- I can't stop, Buffy. I tried, and I can't.
BUFFY	You can.
WILLOW	I can't. Please help me. Oh, God, I need help...
WILLOW	Is she okay?
BUFFY	Sleeping. The ER doc gave her something for the pain. It knocked her out.
WILLOW	But she's going to be alright?
BUFFY	It's a fracture. It takes time, but...
BUFFY	I just - I don't understand. Why you'd go to somebody like Rack. And why you'd drag Dawn into it.
WILLOW	I didn't mean to. I wasn't going to... We were just going to the movies.
BUFFY	So what happened?
WILLOW	I don't know. The magic. I thought I had it under control. And then... I didn't.
BUFFY	Why? Because of Tara?
WILLOW	No. It started before she left. It's why she left.
BUFFY	But everything seemed to be going so well...
WILLOW	It was... But, I mean, if you could be plain old Willow - or Super Willow? Who would you want to be? I guess you don't actually have the option on the whole "super" thing.
BUFFY	Will, there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need magic to be special-
WILLOW	Don't I? Buffy, who was I? Just some girl. Tara didn't even know that girl...
BUFFY	You were more than "some girl". And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you-
WILLOW	We don't know that-
BUFFY	I know that. I promise you.
WILLOW	It just, it took me away from myself. I felt so... free.
BUFFY	I get that. More than you... But it's wrong. People get hurt.
WILLOW	If something had happened to Dawn tonight, something worse...
BUFFY	I know.
WILLOW	I don't think you do. I was out of my mind. I did things... I can't even...
BUFFY	Good. I think it's right. To give it up. No matter how great it feels-
WILLOW	It's not worth it. Not if it messes with the people I love. I mean, it'll be hard. But I can do it. I know I can.
BUFFY	Hard - but not impossible. We'll be here for each other.
WILLOW	Totally. And magic wasn't all great. I mean, I won't miss the nose bleeds and the headaches and stuff.
BUFFY	Right.
WILLOW	Or keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra. (off Buffy's look) Don't ask.
BUFFY	Well, see, I don't have to now.
WILLOW	'Cause it's over.
BUFFY	Exactly. It's over. From now on it's goodbye impulse - hello impulse control.

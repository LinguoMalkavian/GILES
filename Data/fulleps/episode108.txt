SPIKE	Can we talk?
BUFFY	Vocal cord wise, yes. With each other, no.
SPIKE	We have to talk.
BUFFY	About what?
SPIKE	Um, whatever. Just conversation. For instance, the weather, the... graves.. the -- We kissed, Buffy.
BUFFY	So?
SPIKE	We kissed, you and me, all 'Gone with the Wind' with the rising music and the rising ... music, and what was that Buffy?
BUFFY	A spell.
SPIKE	Don't you get all prim and proper on me. I know what kind of girl you really are.
BUFFY	What we did, is done. But I will never kiss you Spike, never touch you, ever, ever again.
TEETH	Easy, boys. There's no need to get physical-like. Is there Mr. Spike?
BUFFY	You know this guy?
SPIKE	Yeah. What do you want?
TEETH	Me? There are a lot of things I would like. A house in Bel Aire with a generously-sized swimming pool; a lady barracuda who loves me for who I really am ...
SPIKE	Take it easy. You'll get your kittens.
TEETH	I trust you Mr. Spike.
BUFFY	Oh god, what is with you guys? Why kittens? Why can't you use money like normal people?
TEETH	She's funny. I like funny in a girl.
SPIKE	I just need a little time.
TEETH	Time. Time's what turns kittens into cats.
BUFFY	Then you better close your eyes.
TEETH	Good for you. The Vampire Slayer. Have you given any thought to freelance work, a little debt collecting perhaps? I bet you could really bust up a knee cap or two.
BUFFY	No. Thank you.
TEETH	That's what I get for socializing. C'mon boys, up and at'em. We'll locate Mr. Spike and uh, 'talk' to him a little more.
BUFFY	If I just stopped saving his life it would simple things up so much.
ANYA	Do you think she walked around on clouds, wearing like, Birkenstocks and playing a harp? 'Cause those are just not flattering.
XANDER	You are attractive and have many good qualities.
TARA	It's totally not stupid to wonder what it was like for Buffy. But it could have been any one of a zillion heavenly dimensions. All we know is that it was a good place and she was happy there.
WILLOW	And we took her away from that. We wrecked it for her.
XANDER	We didn't wreck. We didn't know.
WILLOW	We didn't want to know. We were so selfish. I was so selfish.
XANDER	Maybe we were, but I feel weird feeling bad that my friend's not dead. It's too mind-boggling. So I've decided to simplify the whole thing: Me like Buffy. Buffy alive. So, me glad.
TARA	Not to be Miss Psycho-pep-squad, but I think we've got to stop obsessing about what we did, and start trying to make things better for Buffy
ANYA	I'm with Miss Psycho-pep-squad.
XANDER	We should spend more time with her. Just hang out. Maybe we should do weekly dinners here. Or a book club, short books, videos.
WILLOW	I can fix it. I know a spell.
TARA	No. No more spells.
WILLOW	Then what? This isn't something we can fix with video clubs. I know I messed up, okay? And I want to fix it.
TARA	It's too much magic.
XANDER	Alright, alright, I'll read a book. It's not that I can't read, it's just my lips get so tired.
TARA	I can't believe we're talking about this again. You know how powerful magic is. How dangerous. You could hurt someone. You could hurt yourself.
WILLOW	I know a spell that would make her forget she was ever in heaven.
TARA	What is wrong with you?
XANDER	I'm just gonna ... answer that phone, you probably don't hear it, high- pitched ring, ears like a dog's...
ANYA	Ah yes. I'll help you answer it.
TARA	Do you think I'm stupid? I know you used that spell on me.
WILLOW	I'm sorry. I didn't-
TARA	Don't. Just - don't. There's nothing you can say.
WILLOW	There is. I never meant to-
TARA	To what? Violate my mind like that? How could you, Willow? How could you after what Glory did to me?
WILLOW	'Violate you?' I didn't mean anything like that. I just wanted not to fight with you. I love you.
TARA	If you don't want to fight, you don't fight. You don't use magic to make a fight disappear.
WILLOW	I wanted to make things better. Better for us.
WILLOW	Okay. I realize, I did it wrong-
TARA	You did it the way you're doing everything, Will. When things get rough, you don't even consider your options - you just do a spell. It's not good for you - and it's not what magic is for.
WILLOW	But I - I'm trying to help people.
WILLOW	Tara, no...
TARA	I don't think this is working.
WILLOW	Hey. It is. It's working.
I	swear.
TARA	Go a week. A week without magic.
WILLOW	Fine, fine. That's easy.
TARA	A week and then we'll see. I don't know. I think we both need some... I don't know, space. I can't believe I'm saying this.
WILLOW	You're saying you're gonna leave me?
GILES	I'm afraid I have to.
BUFFY	Uh-huh. What do you mean 'you have to'? You can't ! Giles, this is when I need you. I'm all messed up. Everything is all messed up.
GILES	I know. But you have to be strong. I'm trying to--
BUFFY	To what? Abandon me, desert me? Leave me all alone when I really need somebody, that's great. That's just really great of you.
GILES	Buffy please, this is hard.
BUFFY	Yeah, I know, I know. This hurts you more than it hurts me. And it will be really hard for you over in jolly old England, palling around with all your jolly old friends and riding around in double decker buses or whatever the hell you do there.
GILES	I don't want to leave-
BUFFY	So don't. Please don't, okay? I can't do this without you.
GILES	But you can. That's why I'm going. As long as I stay, when things arise that you feel you can't handle, you'll turn to me. And I'll step in, because... Because I hate to see you suffer.
GILES	And I'm loathe to cause you any more, believe me. But this is...
BUFFY	But why now? Now that you know where I've been. What I'm dealing with-
GILES	Now more than ever. The temptation to give up must be powerful. I can't let that happen.
BUFFY	So I won't. No giving up. You can be here and I can still be strong. I don't have to depend on you as much as I have.
GILES	Buffy. I've thought this over. And over. I think it's the right thing.
BUFFY	You're wrong.
GILES	I don't think so. I hope not.
DAWN	Willow! Get the lead out.
DAWN	What's does that mean anyway? Get what lead out of where?
TARA	Cars.
DAWN	Oh. For some reason I always pictured mechanical pencils. Wil-low! C'mon! You ready?
WILLOW	Not so much. You go ahead. Tell Giles to hold up, I'm there in a sec.
TARA	Fine.
DAWN	Hurry up, you don't wanna miss the lowdown on our latest featured creature.
WILLOW	'For Buffy and Tara this I char, let Lethe's Bramble do its chore. Purge their minds of memories grim, of pains from recent slights and sins...
DAWN	So what do we got?
GILES	Sorry?
DAWN	What kind of oogly-booglys? Lizardy- types, or zombies, or vampires or what?
GILES	Dawn. There are no 'oogly-booglys'.
WILLOW	Thanks, it's cold out there.
XANDER	Not a problem. The cold only makes me stronger and more macho-like.
GILES	I'm glad you're here.
BUFFY	Why don't you jump to the chase, Giles? Just tell them that you're-
SPIKE	Fancy meeting you here.
GILES	Spike?
ANYA	Holy moly.
SPIKE	You need to give me asylum.
XANDER	I'll say.
SPIKE	No need to get cute. It's a disguise. Thrift shop number. Happens there's a bloke I'd rather not see just now. (to Buffy) You met him, I believe. The toothy bloke with the baby seal breath?
GILES	Alright, then. If we've recovered from Spike's sartorial humor...
XANDER	Now? Not now, not right after... everything.
GILES	Yes, now-
ANYA	For real this time? 'Cause honest to Pete, a young shopkeeper's heart can only be broken so many times. I mean, not that I want you to--
WILLOW	Buffy. I... listen. I know this must be awful for you. And I'm sorry, so sorry, for what we put you--
BUFFY	I'm sorry. Everybody's sorry. And I know you're trying to help me. But it's all too much, Will. The memories, they hurt. I can't take it anymore.
BUFFY	If you understood how it felt - how it feels now... It's like I'm dying in-
BUFFY	Huh.
WILLOW	Uhh!
XANDER	Uhh!
WILLOW	Hey?
GILES	Hello.
SPIKE	AAAaaa!
DAWN	AAAAAA!
BUFFY	Hey, don't worry.
DAWN	Please don't hurt me.
BUFFY	It's okay. I don't know anyone here either.
DAWN	Yeah? Who are you?
BUFFY	I...nm, I--
XANDER	Who are you freaks?
WILLOW	You don't know me?
XANDER	I don't have a clue.
WILLOW	But you just acted all, 'Hey.'
XANDER	Yeah, 'cause I thought you were a girl and I'd remember in a second but--
WILLOW	I am a girl. I'm... not sure who I am. Exactly. But--
XANDER	Okay... why was I on the ground? And why are you all staring at me? Is this some kind of psych test? Am I getting paid for this? Is this a bad dream?
I	didn't do it! And if I did, it was an accident.
SPIKE	Nope.
GILES	Perhaps we all got terribly drunk and we're having some kind of black-out.
DAWN	I don't think I d-drink.
ANYA	I don't see any booze; I don't feel any head bumps; and I don't see Alan Funt.
XANDER	Okay... I'm not panicking, I'm not, I'm not. Stop looking at me like I'm panicking.
BUFFY	Hey, take it easy, guy. No one's hurt, right? And none of us looks all hatchet murder-y, so we're probably safe. Here. Wherever here is.
WILLOW	Look at the things on these shelves: weird jars of weird stuff and weird books with weird covers like: 'Magic for beginners'. Oh.
TARA	A magic shop. A real magic shop.
BUFFY	Maybe that's it. Maybe something magic happened to us.
GILES	Magic? Magic is all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing. Except I seem to be British, don't I? And a man. With glasses. Well, that narrows it down considerably.
DAWN	I don't like this.
BUFFY	Listen, it's going to be okay. We'll take care of each other, okay?
GILES	Yes, we'll get back our memories and everything will be right as rain.
SPIKE	Oh listen to Mary Poppins! Got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen are always so -- Bloody hell. Sodding blimy shagging knickers bullocks -- oh no. I'm English.
GILES	Welcome to the nancy tribe.
SPIKE	You don't suppose... you and I... we' re not related, are we?
ANYA	There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.
GILES	And you do inspire a particular feeling of familiarity... and disappointment. Older brother?
ANYA	Well, I'm thinking more like --
SPIKE	Father! My god how I must hate you.
GILES	What did I do?
SPIKE	Oh, there's always something. And what's with the trollop?
ANYA	Hey!
GILES	Her?
SPIKE	I saw you... sleeping together.
GILES	Resting together!
ANYA	Look!
GILES	Oh.
ANYA	It's a lovely ring.
SPIKE	Great, a tarty step-Mum who's half ol' Daddy's age.
ANYA	Tarty!
GILES	Old! I'm young enough to still get carded--
WILLOW	Carded! Driver's licenses!
XANDER	Look! Me! Alexander Harris. Cute picture. Hey, I exist!
WILLOW	I'm Willow Rosenberg. 'Willow'! Funny name.
TARA	I think it's pretty.
WILLOW	What do you got?
TARA	Tara. And look, I'm a student at UC Sunnydale.
WILLOW	Me too! Maybe we're study buddies.
DAWN	I don't have a wallet.
BUFFY	Don't worry, me neither. But here...
DAWN	Or 'Umad'.
GILES	I'm called, let's see, 'Rupert Giles'.
ANYA	Rupert.
SPIKE	Rupert.
GILES	You're not too old to take over my knee... Son. What did I call you anyway?
SPIKE	'Made with care for Randy'. 'Randy' Giles?! Why didn't you just name me 'Horny Giles' or 'Desperate- for-a-shag Giles'? I knew there was a reason I hated you!
GILES	Randy's a family name. Undoubtedly.
WILLOW	I've got a name on my jacket too.
XANDER	Harris? That's my last name. Hey, maybe I have a brother and you go out with him. ... or, maybe you go out with me.
WILLOW	We did wake up all snuggly wuggly. I guess maybe you're my boyfriend.
XANDER	Either that or I have one pissed off brother out there somewhere.
ANYA	My key fits the lock and I found some forms by the register that say Rupert and Anya own the shop together. That's me. Anya Shop-owner.
GILES	This is our magic shop? Well, that's... very progressive of me. You know it truly is a small mind that fails to acknowledge the, um, alternatives to our rational, scientific understanding of the universe. (changing subject) Oh look! Fancy herbs!
DAWN	So you don't have a name?
BUFFY	Of course I do. I just don't happen to know it.
DAWN	You want me to name you?
BUFFY	That's sweet, but I think I can name myself. I'll name me.. Joan.
DAWN	Ug!
DAWN	I didn't. It's just so.. .blarg. 'Joan'?
BUFFY	I like it. I feel like a Joan.
DAWN	Fine. That's your purgative.
BUFFY	Prerogative.
DAWN	Whatever. 'Joan'.
BUFFY	Whatever. 'Umad'.
BUFFY	Boy you're a pain in the neck. DAWN Boy you're bossy.
DAWN	Do you think we're--
BUFFY	Sisters.
SPIKE	You never showed me affection like that. I'd wager.
BUFFY	We've got to figure out what's going on. We need to get help.
SPIKE	Looks like 'Joan' fancies herself the boss.
BUFFY	We've got a kid here--
DAWN	A teenager.
BUFFY	A teenager, and we have no idea what's wrong with us. I think a hospital's our best bet.
GILES	Alright then, let's head out.
BUFFY	Any suggestions on how we get there?
SPIKE	Dad can drive. He's bound to have some classic mid-life crisis transport: something red, sporty, shaped like a penis.
ALL	AAAAAAAaaaaaa!!!!
ALL	AAAAAAaaaaa!!!!
BUFFY	Did you see what I--
SPIKE	Vampires!
TARA	Maybe it's Halloween.
DAWN	Doesn't feel like Halloween.
XANDER	Even if it is, those were definitely not kids and they were definitely not wearing costumes. Randy's right. We got vampires!
WILLOW	Doors! We should check for other doors, make sure they're locked and then put big heavy things in front of them! Come on!
BUFFY	Monsters are real... Did we know this?
TARA	I don't know. We n-need our memories back! We have to get to the hospital!
GILES	Speaking as the proprietor of a Magic Shop, I propose we fight back. We can use things here in the shop, magic... tricks or whatever they call--
GILES	They seem to want spikes.
SPIKE	Oh, I saw some...
DAWN	Wait. What are they going to do--
TARA	Slay her! That's just what they said before. They're going to use those spikes--
BUFFY	To slay someone. A female someone! Who do those jerks think they are?
ANYA	Bloodsuckers, that kill, by sucking blood. Take it easy, Joan.
XANDER	There's a trapdoor in the basement, seems to lead to the sewer.
XANDER	Now I'm not sure what I am, so bear with me here, okay? Um, Now I lay me down to sleep... Shema Israel...uh, Ohm, Ohm.
SPIKE	Fine! Take the damn spikes!
BUFFY	Let go 'a me, you big, nasty--
SPIKE	Who, me?
SPIKE	Kittens?
BUFFY	Stay away from Randy!
DAWN	Whoa!
WILLOW	What did you just do?
BUFFY	I don't know.
BUFFY	I think I know why Joan's the boss. I'm like a superhero or something.
TEETH	The 'boys' are barbarians. There's no need for that. The humans will turn on him soon enough. And if not...
BUFFY	Okay, I've got a plan.
XANDER	All ears.
BUFFY	They seem to want Randy. And I seem to be pretty strong. Wicked strong. So, while you all go through the sewer and find the hospital, Randy and I'll take the monsters for a run.
SPIKE	That's your plan?
BUFFY	Yes.
SPIKE	Right.
ANYA	I'm not leaving the shop. I need to protect the cash register and... do spells.
GILES	Perhaps magic can help us. It's worth a shot.
BUFFY	Alright. You two work on that then. We gotta go. Ready Randy?
SPIKE	Ready Joan.
GILES	Come here please.
SPIKE	Right.
GILES	Good then.
BUFFY	Randy!
SPIKE	Hey! I'm a superhero, too?
SPIKE	Hey Joan, wait up!
XANDER	Almost there.
DAWN	Thank you.
WILLOW	All directions look equally dank and stinky.
TARA	How 'bout this dank and stinky way?
XANDER	Sounds great.
DAWN	The ants go marching one by one. Hurrah! Hurrah! The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hur- AAAAH!
GILES	Let's do some magic.
ANYA	This must be nice for us.
GILES	Sorry?
ANYA	I mean, I know there's the vampire problem and our memory loss and all that, but still. To spend this time together. Alone. It must be nice.
GILES	Uh.. Yes, quite right. So, which book shall we start with?
ANYA	This is the book for us.
GILES	Oh good, it focuses on mind control or memory loss?
ANYA	Not exactly. I just...my intuition tells me this is the book. And I figure being a magic shop owner and a natural at the supernatural, I should trust my intuition.
GILES	Fine. But as you'll recall, I too own a magic shop.
ANYA	True. But, my intuition says you're not so much the 'magic guy' and more of a paperwork type.
GILES	A paperwork type!
ANYA	You probably sweep up too. Now, here we go.
GILES	But you don't even know what you're--
ANYA	'Bara Bare Himble Gemination!'
SPIKE	Wait up!
BUFFY	You don't know who you are.
SPIKE	Right. None of us do. And we're being chased by the fiendy--
BUFFY	You're a vampire.
SPIKE	How could you... I... me a vampire... Nah...
BUFFY	Check out the lumpies... and the teeth.
SPIKE	And I bite yours.
BUFFY	Oh my god, 'a vampire with a soul'?! How lame is that?
GILES	Perhaps we should try another book.
SPIKE	I'm a hero, really. I mean, to be cast such an ugly lot but then to rise above it, to seek better, nobler things. It's inspiring, in'it?
BUFFY	Kinda depends on how long you keep on yakking-- What's that?
TARA	C'mon. This way. Up the ladder.
XANDER	He's coming.
GILES	That is clearly not a helpful book, dear. Come down and we'll go about fixing this in a sensible fashion.
GILES	Fine. Stay there and make bunnies. That's a capital plan.
ANYA	What? Capital? I never know what you're talking about. Loo, shag brolly: what the hell is all that?
GILES	Look, there's no way you remember me saying any of those words--
ANYA	Oh bugger off, you.. brolly!
SPIKE	You know what you're doing?
BUFFY	Not really. But. Yes.
TEETH	Why if it isn't Mr. Spike and the Slayer. It seems there was some miscommunication between us. Somehow you've killed three of my vampires.
BUFFY	Note to self: learn to duck.
GILES	Get a different book. Put that book down. Do you hear me? Not that book. Bad book. Bad book!
WILLOW	How ya doin', Dawn?
DAWN	Okay. It's scary. But weirdly? Kind of familiar.
WILLOW	I know what you mean.
DAWN	How are you?
WILLOW	A little confused. I mean, I'm sweaty, I'm trapped, no memory, hiding in a pipe, from a vampire -
GILES	Look what you've done now, you lunatic woman!
TAKE	SOME VENGEANCE ON YOU!
GILES	You know, it's no wonder I'm leaving you!
ANYA	What?
GILES	A one-way ticket to London and out of this engagement!
ANYA	Of all the nerve!
XANDER	Yaaa!
GILES	Himble voyon abri bara!
ANYA	Oh, thank goodness.
GILES	I'm so sorry, Dear.
GILES	Well, yes. Yes, it was. But I'm still sorry.
ANYA	Don't leave me.
GILES	Oh. Oh, Anya.
XANDER	Wow.
BUFFY	Don't mess with Joan the Vampire -
SPIKE	Buffy... Buff--
XANDER	Sorry. Just got back the memory of seeing 'King Ralph'. We should go back.
GILES	Well, this place is certainly in need of a good tidying?
ANYA	Oh yes, yes, yes.
SPIKE	From dust...
TEETH	Fighting your own kind. Palling around with a Slayer. And, whoa, that suit! Chutzpah must be your middle name.
SPIKE	You'll get paid. I'm no welsher.
TEETH	Right, sure. You're good for it. I know that. So, I'll just, uh... Yeah.
SPIKE	You alright?
BUFFY	So?
SPIKE	We kissed, you and me, all 'Gone with the Wind' with the rising music and the rising ... music, and what was that Buffy?
BUFFY	A spell.
BUFFY	What we did, is done. But I will never kiss you Spike, never touch you, ever, ever again.
BUFFY	You know this guy?
SPIKE	Yeah. What do you want?
SPIKE	Take it easy. You'll get your kittens.
TEETH	I trust you Mr. Spike.
BUFFY	Oh god, what is with you guys? Why kittens? Why can't you use money like normal people?
TEETH	She's funny. I like funny in a girl.
SPIKE	I just need a little time.
TEETH	Time. Time's what turns kittens into cats.
TEETH	Good for you. The Vampire Slayer. Have you given any thought to freelance work, a little debt collecting perhaps? I bet you could really bust up a knee cap or two.
BUFFY	No. Thank you.
TARA	It's totally not stupid to wonder what it was like for Buffy. But it could have been any one of a zillion heavenly dimensions. All we know is that it was a good place and she was happy there.
WILLOW	And we took her away from that. We wrecked it for her.

WILLOW	I can fix it. I know a spell.
TARA	No. No more spells.
WILLOW	Then what? This isn't something we can fix with video clubs. I know I messed up, okay? And I want to fix it.
TARA	It's too much magic.
WILLOW	I'm sorry. I didn't-
TARA	Don't. Just - don't. There's nothing you can say.
WILLOW	There is. I never meant to-
TARA	To what? Violate my mind like that? How could you, Willow? How could you after what Glory did to me?
WILLOW	'Violate you?' I didn't mean anything like that. I just wanted not to fight with you. I love you.
TARA	If you don't want to fight, you don't fight. You don't use magic to make a fight disappear.
WILLOW	I wanted to make things better. Better for us.

WILLOW	But I - I'm trying to help people.
WILLOW	Tara, no...
TARA	I don't think this is working.
WILLOW	Hey. It is. It's working.
TARA	Go a week. A week without magic.
WILLOW	Fine, fine. That's easy.
GILES	I'm afraid I have to.
BUFFY	Uh-huh. What do you mean 'you have to'? You can't ! Giles, this is when I need you. I'm all messed up. Everything is all messed up.
GILES	I know. But you have to be strong. I'm trying to--
BUFFY	To what? Abandon me, desert me? Leave me all alone when I really need somebody, that's great. That's just really great of you.
GILES	Buffy please, this is hard.
BUFFY	Yeah, I know, I know. This hurts you more than it hurts me. And it will be really hard for you over in jolly old England, palling around with all your jolly old friends and riding around in double decker buses or whatever the hell you do there.

DAWN	Oh. For some reason I always pictured mechanical pencils. Wil-low! C'mon! You ready?
WILLOW	Not so much. You go ahead. Tell Giles to hold up, I'm there in a sec.

BUFFY	Hey, take it easy, guy. No one's hurt, right? And none of us looks all hatchet murder-y, so we're probably safe. Here. Wherever here is.
WILLOW	Look at the things on these shelves: weird jars of weird stuff and weird books with weird covers like: 'Magic for beginners'. Oh.
TARA	A magic shop. A real magic shop.
BUFFY	Maybe that's it. Maybe something magic happened to us.
GILES	Magic? Magic is all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing. Except I seem to be British, don't I? And a man. With glasses. Well, that narrows it down considerably.
DAWN	I don't like this.
GILES	Yes, we'll get back our memories and everything will be right as rain.
SPIKE	Oh listen to Mary Poppins! Got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen are always so -- Bloody hell. Sodding blimy shagging knickers bullocks -- oh no. I'm English.
GILES	Welcome to the nancy tribe.
SPIKE	You don't suppose... you and I... we' re not related, are we?
ANYA	There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.
GILES	And you do inspire a particular feeling of familiarity... and disappointment. Older brother?
ANYA	Well, I'm thinking more like --
SPIKE	Father! My god how I must hate you.
GILES	What did I do?
SPIKE	Oh, there's always something. And what's with the trollop?
ANYA	Hey!
GILES	Her?
SPIKE	I saw you... sleeping together.
GILES	Resting together!
ANYA	Look!
ANYA	It's a lovely ring.
SPIKE	Great, a tarty step-Mum who's half ol' Daddy's age.
ANYA	Tarty!
GILES	Old! I'm young enough to still get carded--
WILLOW	Carded! Driver's licenses!
XANDER	Look! Me! Alexander Harris. Cute picture. Hey, I exist!
WILLOW	I'm Willow Rosenberg. 'Willow'! Funny name.
TARA	I think it's pretty.
WILLOW	What do you got?
TARA	Tara. And look, I'm a student at UC Sunnydale.
WILLOW	Me too! Maybe we're study buddies.
DAWN	I don't have a wallet.
BUFFY	Don't worry, me neither. But here...
GILES	I'm called, let's see, 'Rupert Giles'.
ANYA	Rupert.
SPIKE	Rupert.
GILES	You're not too old to take over my knee... Son. What did I call you anyway?
SPIKE	'Made with care for Randy'. 'Randy' Giles?! Why didn't you just name me 'Horny Giles' or 'Desperate- for-a-shag Giles'? I knew there was a reason I hated you!
GILES	Randy's a family name. Undoubtedly.
WILLOW	I've got a name on my jacket too.
XANDER	Harris? That's my last name. Hey, maybe I have a brother and you go out with him. ... or, maybe you go out with me.
WILLOW	We did wake up all snuggly wuggly. I guess maybe you're my boyfriend.
XANDER	Either that or I have one pissed off brother out there somewhere.
ANYA	My key fits the lock and I found some forms by the register that say Rupert and Anya own the shop together. That's me. Anya Shop-owner.
GILES	This is our magic shop? Well, that's... very progressive of me. You know it truly is a small mind that fails to acknowledge the, um, alternatives to our rational, scientific understanding of the universe. (changing subject) Oh look! Fancy herbs!
DAWN	So you don't have a name?
BUFFY	Of course I do. I just don't happen to know it.
DAWN	You want me to name you?
BUFFY	That's sweet, but I think I can name myself. I'll name me.. Joan.
DAWN	Ug!
DAWN	I didn't. It's just so.. .blarg. 'Joan'?
BUFFY	I like it. I feel like a Joan.
DAWN	Fine. That's your purgative.
BUFFY	Prerogative.
DAWN	Whatever. 'Joan'.
BUFFY	Whatever. 'Umad'.
DAWN	Do you think we're--
BUFFY	Sisters.
SPIKE	You never showed me affection like that. I'd wager.
BUFFY	We've got to figure out what's going on. We need to get help.
SPIKE	Looks like 'Joan' fancies herself the boss.
BUFFY	We've got a kid here--
DAWN	A teenager.
BUFFY	A teenager, and we have no idea what's wrong with us. I think a hospital's our best bet.
GILES	Alright then, let's head out.
BUFFY	Any suggestions on how we get there?
SPIKE	Dad can drive. He's bound to have some classic mid-life crisis transport: something red, sporty, shaped like a penis.
ALL	AAAAAAAaaaaaa!!!!
ALL	AAAAAAaaaaa!!!!
BUFFY	Did you see what I--
SPIKE	Vampires!
TARA	Maybe it's Halloween.
DAWN	Doesn't feel like Halloween.
XANDER	Even if it is, those were definitely not kids and they were definitely not wearing costumes. Randy's right. We got vampires!
WILLOW	Doors! We should check for other doors, make sure they're locked and then put big heavy things in front of them! Come on!
BUFFY	Monsters are real... Did we know this?
TARA	I don't know. We n-need our memories back! We have to get to the hospital!
GILES	Speaking as the proprietor of a Magic Shop, I propose we fight back. We can use things here in the shop, magic... tricks or whatever they call--
GILES	They seem to want spikes.
SPIKE	Oh, I saw some...
DAWN	Wait. What are they going to do--
TARA	Slay her! That's just what they said before. They're going to use those spikes--
BUFFY	To slay someone. A female someone! Who do those jerks think they are?
ANYA	Bloodsuckers, that kill, by sucking blood. Take it easy, Joan.
XANDER	There's a trapdoor in the basement, seems to lead to the sewer.
SPIKE	Who, me?
SPIKE	Kittens?
DAWN	Whoa!
WILLOW	What did you just do?
TEETH	The 'boys' are barbarians. There's no need for that. The humans will turn on him soon enough. And if not...
BUFFY	Okay, I've got a plan.
XANDER	All ears.
BUFFY	They seem to want Randy. And I seem to be pretty strong. Wicked strong. So, while you all go through the sewer and find the hospital, Randy and I'll take the monsters for a run.
SPIKE	That's your plan?
BUFFY	Yes.
SPIKE	Right.
ANYA	I'm not leaving the shop. I need to protect the cash register and... do spells.
GILES	Perhaps magic can help us. It's worth a shot.
BUFFY	Alright. You two work on that then. We gotta go. Ready Randy?
SPIKE	Right.
GILES	Good then.
WILLOW	All directions look equally dank and stinky.
TARA	How 'bout this dank and stinky way?
XANDER	Sounds great.
ANYA	This must be nice for us.
GILES	Sorry?
ANYA	This is the book for us.
GILES	Oh good, it focuses on mind control or memory loss?
ANYA	Not exactly. I just...my intuition tells me this is the book. And I figure being a magic shop owner and a natural at the supernatural, I should trust my intuition.
GILES	Fine. But as you'll recall, I too own a magic shop.
ANYA	True. But, my intuition says you're not so much the 'magic guy' and more of a paperwork type.
GILES	A paperwork type!
ANYA	You probably sweep up too. Now, here we go.
GILES	But you don't even know what you're--
ANYA	'Bara Bare Himble Gemination!'
BUFFY	You don't know who you are.
SPIKE	Right. None of us do. And we're being chased by the fiendy--
BUFFY	You're a vampire.
SPIKE	How could you... I... me a vampire... Nah...
BUFFY	Check out the lumpies... and the teeth.
SPIKE	And I bite yours.
GILES	Perhaps we should try another book.
BUFFY	Kinda depends on how long you keep on yakking-- What's that?
GILES	That is clearly not a helpful book, dear. Come down and we'll go about fixing this in a sensible fashion.
GILES	Fine. Stay there and make bunnies. That's a capital plan.
ANYA	What? Capital? I never know what you're talking about. Loo, shag brolly: what the hell is all that?
GILES	Look, there's no way you remember me saying any of those words--
ANYA	Oh bugger off, you.. brolly!
SPIKE	You know what you're doing?
BUFFY	Not really. But. Yes.
WILLOW	How ya doin', Dawn?
DAWN	Okay. It's scary. But weirdly? Kind of familiar.
WILLOW	I know what you mean.
DAWN	How are you?
WILLOW	A little confused. I mean, I'm sweaty, I'm trapped, no memory, hiding in a pipe, from a vampire -
GILES	Look what you've done now, you lunatic woman!
TAKE	SOME VENGEANCE ON YOU!
GILES	A one-way ticket to London and out of this engagement!
ANYA	Of all the nerve!
GILES	I'm so sorry, Dear.
GILES	Well, yes. Yes, it was. But I'm still sorry.
ANYA	Don't leave me.
GILES	Oh. Oh, Anya.
GILES	Well, this place is certainly in need of a good tidying?
ANYA	Oh yes, yes, yes.

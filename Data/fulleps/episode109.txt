MAN	I'm sure we can work something out.
WOMAN	A deal of some sort. Anything you want.
BUFFY	Oh. You weren't really speaking to me, were you? My bad. Well, as long as I'm here...
I	guess. But come on, rush me. It'll be funny.
BUFFY	No!
SPIKE	Ow!
BUFFY	What the hell is wrong with you?
SPIKE	Ow . Thought they were demons
BUFFY	Yeah, way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.
SPIKE	Remind me not to help you.
BUFFY	More often?
SPIKE	A little sympathy for the man with the migraine, can we...
BUFFY	That's what you get for attacking a human.
SPIKE	Yeah. You'd think if the government's gonna put a chip in my head, they'd at least make it so I could attack criminals and that sort.
BUFFY	Yes, 'cause muggers deserve to be eaten. You're just gonna have to get your rocks off fighting demons, Spike.
SPIKE	There's other ways...
BUFFY	And to that an extreme see-ya-later
SPIKE	Buffy.
BUFFY	Spike. It's late. Can we finish this another time?
SPIKE	Wanna jump right to the kissing then, eh?
BUFFY	I'm not kissing you. Once was--
SPIKE	Twice.
BUFFY	But not again.
SPIKE	You're a tease, Slayer. Know that? Get a fella's motor revvin', let the tension marinate a couple of days, then -bam! Crown yourself the Ice Queen.
BUFFY	You need any more metaphors for that li'l mix?
SPIKE	Only a matter of time before you realize. I'm the only one here for you, pet! You got no one else!
WILLOW	Aw, whatsa matter, Amy? You lonely? We gotta get you a nice companion rat that you can love and play with and grow attached to 'til it leaves you for no good reason. Won't that be fun?
WILLOW	Reveal!
WILLOW	What was is no longer. What was done, undo. The danger passed, the trial no more, set it right.
WARREN	Dude, what are you doing?
JONATHAN	We're not breaking into Langley here -it's Sunnydale.
ANDREW	Well, you never know what new stuff they have, better to be safe than --
WARREN	Okay, the security system here is a guy named Rusty.
WARREN	Now get up.
ANDREW	Whoa, head rush. Cool.
WARREN	Guys, come on.
ANDREW	See? That's cool. How come he gets to play with all the cool stuff?
JONATHAN	'Cause I'm allergic to methane, and you're still afraid of hot things.
ANDREW	I know
JONATHAN	Besides. The tank kept making both of us tip over, remember?
WARREN	Got it!
JONATHAN	It's beautiful.
WARREN	Boys, congratulations. Phase One of The Plan is now complete. Let's get the hell outta here.
WARREN	Oh, we were with a tour group, the get the freeze ray group. Must have gotten separated.
RUSTY	Museum closed five hours ago.
WARREN	Really? Huh. Guess we just lost track of time and we should just get the freeze ray out of here now.
ANDREW	The freeze ray totally worked!
WARREN	Okay, so there's a kink of two. It's just a prototype, soon we'll have --
JONATHAN	Hey, that's really neat-o and stuff, but, in the meantime, you know. Ow!
WARREN	Jeez, be a bigger wuss.
JONATHAN	Can we just go back to the lair, I can't really feel my fingers.
WARREN	Yeah, yeah, come on.
ANDREW	Is he gonna, like --?
WARREN	He'll be fine. He'll defrost in a couple days, no harm no foul.
ANDREW	Won't he tell on us?
WARREN	And say what? Two guys and a mime took me out with their freeze ray? Likely. C'mon.
WILLOW	Hey, here's some hot chocolate, you want --
AMY	Mmmm-mmm. No, thanks. Still kinda queasy.
WILLOW	Okay, maybe later. How're you --
AMY	Mmmm-hmmmm. Yeah. Just, you know. Everything feels weird.
WILLOW	Amy. Three things we have to talk about. One, Larry's gay. Two, Larry's dead. Three, high school's... kind of over.
AMY	How long was I in the cage?
WILLOW	Listen, why don't you have some --
AMY	How. Long.
BUFFY	Willow?
BUFFY	Hey. How you doing?
WILLOW	Oh. Um ...okay.
BUFFY	Yeah?
WILLOW	Yeah. Not parades and cotton candy, but okay.
BUFFY	Will. Can I talk to you about something?
WILLOW	Of course
BUFFY	Right. Okay, you know how we all make choices, and sometimes, they're the really good kind, and sometimes they're ...less good?
WILLOW	Uh-huh.
AMY	The whole school?
BUFFY	Hi.
AMY	Rat. You?
BUFFY	Dead.
AMY	Oh.
BUFFY	Well, I should let you guys catch up, I'll just --
AMY	No, it's okay, stay. Do you have any cookies?
BUFFY	What kind?
AMY	Any kind. Not cheese.
BUFFY	Yeah, kitchen. You want me to--
AMY	No, no. I'll grab 'em.
BUFFY	Okay, well, at least let me make up the couch. It's late, you should stay here. Everyone does.
AMY	Thank you.
BUFFY	Wow.
WILLOW	I know.
BUFFY	Is she gonna be --
WILLOW	Dunno. She's kinda freaked out, but I would be, too.
BUFFY	Wow.
WILLOW	I know. I just ...realized I could. I thought of the right thing and ...
BUFFY	Huh? Oh -nothing. I mean, the whole Amy-Rat-Amy thing? No way I'm topping that.
BUFFY	How you doin', you need anything?
AMY	No. Thanks. Good cookies.
BUFFY	Thanks.
AMY	Crazy all the things that've happened since I went away.
BUFFY	No kidding.
AMY	Snyder got eaten by a snake, the high school got destroyed...
BUFFY	Oh! Gatorade has a new flavor. Blue.
AMY	See, head spinning.
REPORTER	--in critical yet stable condition, as local authorities continue their investigation into the robbery that left one man frozen solid. Live from the Museum, Jason Manning, KCTV.
AMY	Weird.
BUFFY	If I could just -- I need to --
SPIKE	Well, well, well, look who decided to show up.
BUFFY	What are you doing here?
SPIKE	You know, a man was frozen alive in there. Little compassion, love.
BUFFY	And I'm supposed to believe you just happen to be on the case?
SPIKE	Buffy. I'm on everyone's case.
BUFFY	Yeah, that never really seems to end well, does it?
SPIKE	It did the other night.
BUFFY	You seem awfully fixated on a couple of kisses, Spike.
SPIKE	And you seem awfully quick to forget about 'em.
BUFFY	It didn't mean anything!
SPIKE	But --
BUFFY	When I kissed you? You know I was thinking about Giles, right?
SPIKE	You know, I always wondered about you two.
BUFFY	Wha ...? Oh. Eew. Spike. Gaah! He left, I was depressed, ergo vulnerability and bad kissing decisions. You need to let it go, because that's all it was, okay?
SPIKE	Did it work?
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	You convince yourself?
BUFFY	Please. Stop.
SPIKE	A man can change.
BUFFY	You're not a man. You're a thing.
SPIKE	Stop walking away --
SPIKE	Owww. Owwww.
BUFFY	You're just a thing. An evil, disgusting thing. All right?
SPIKE	Look at all the goodies.
SPIKE	That's right, you should scream.
GIRL	Please...
SPIKE	She thinks I'm housebroken. She forgot who she was dealing with.
GIRL	Anything you want, please, just --
SPIKE	Just 'cause she's confused about where she fits in, I'm supposed to be, too? 'Cause I'm not.
GIRL	I -- I'm sure you're not evil.
SPIKE	Yes, I am. I'm a killer. That's what I do. I kill.
TARA	Good God, that's a lot of shake.
DAWN	Helps to wash down the Raisinets.
TARA	Promise me you'll eat something green tonight. Leafy green, not gummi green.
DAWN	Yeah, it was ironic when all those cute inner city kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.
TARA	You know I'll always be there for you, right?
DAWN	I know.
TARA	I just, I wanted you to know. My moving out had nothing to do with you, and I will never stop --
DAWN	I know.
TARA	I wish I knew.
DAWN	But you still love her.
TARA	Very much. It's just, you know. Sometimes other things get in the way.
DAWN	But, you know she misses you.
TARA	You know what's important is that you don't ever have to worry. Our stuff is our stuff, but it never touches you. We both love you, and we both will always love you.
DAWN	I know. She's doing a lot better lately, though. She's been really good about being careful. About stuff.
TARA	Well, good. Great. That's great.
WILLOW	Here. Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
XANDER	He's all thawed out now. They used hair-dryers. Huh.
WILLOW	Everything slowed down, nervous system, circulatory system. He's still unconscious.
BUFFY	Anya?
ANYA	It's such a pain. The text I wanted? Giles took it with him. He has this thing that "owning" a book made it, like, his "property."
BUFFY	So what do we do? Call him? It's the middle of last night there. Or maybe tomorrow. Does anyone remember how that works?
WILLOW	It's okay. No one freak. We'll just do this another way.
BUFFY	Magic? I don't think we need to resort to --
XANDER	All right, back to basics. A little old-fashioned state-of-the-art hacker action.
BUFFY	That's great, Will. Haven't seen you do that in a long time...
WILLOW	It's quicker. It'll just take a sec to go through the files.
BUFFY	Is it a supernatural diamond? Like, all good-lucky? Or healing powers?
ANYA	Maybe it's cursed. Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
WILLOW	Well, let's do some more checking, shall we?
XANDER	Sure, but, you know, I am really beat. And I bet that's tiring, the... thing you're doing there.
WILLOW	Guys, I'm fine, really. What's the deal with --
ANYA	Oh, for crying out loud. This is bizarre. You're all la la with the magic and the not-talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you and now everyone's scared to say anything to you. Except me. Is this that thing I do that you comment on sometimes?
WILLOW	Guys, it's okay. It's hard, but -- but it's better this way, believe me. Little things started taking over, things that don't matter, but we saw them differently, and so they got blown out of proportion.
XANDER	Amy. Is she... how is she adjusting?
WILLOW	I'm not sure. It's a lot to take in. I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty stuff, licking her hands clean or shredding newspaper or making little pellets in the corner.
BUFFY	Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
JONATHAN	I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
WARREN	Yes, gentlemen, it turns out size is everything. No offense, man.
ANDREW	It makes colors with the light!
WARREN	All right, guys, we finished the first part. It's time for Phase Two.
JONATHAN	Check, we're all --
ANDREW	Hello, it's called knocking.
SPIKE	Knock, knock Robot-Boy. Need you to look at my chip.
JONATHAN	Is that, like, British slang or something, 'cause we're not --
SPIKE	In my head. The chip in my head.
WARREN	You know, we're kind of in the middle of something.
SPIKE	You can play holodeck another time. Right now, I'm in charge.
WARREN	And what are you gonna do if we don't especially feel like playing your little-- What are you doing?
SPIKE	Examine my chip or else Mr. --
JONATHAN	Hey, all right, let's not, let's not do anything crazy...
ANDREW	That's a limited edition 1979 mint condition Boba Fett!
WARREN	All right, dude, chill. You can still make it right. You know you don't wanna do this.
SPIKE	What I want is answers, nimrod.
WARREN	Right, but, you don't wanna hurt the Fett. Cuz, man, you're not coming back from that. You don't do that and walk away.
SPIKE	That right? Let's find out.
WARREN	A second.
ANDREW	Dudes! I think that's Spike!
JONATHAN	Of course it is. And he's evil. Completely capable of removing that head.
WARREN	I'm gonna help him out.
JONATHAN	Are you sure we can trust him? I mean, we all have heads too.
WARREN	We help him and he owes us one. See, we get Spike on our side, we get info on Buffy. Maybe we even find out how to keep her away from phase two.
ANDREW	But Jonathan's right, can we trust him?
WARREN	Course not, alliances aren't about trust. He needs us, we need him, it's how these things work.
JONATHAN	Agreed.
ANDREW	Do what you need to do.
WARREN	I think we can work something out. I'll look at your chip. It'll be a deal. We scratch your back, you scratch --
SPIKE	I'm not scratching your anything. You do what I say. That's the deal. Deal?
WARREN	Deal.
SPIKE	Then let's go.
ANDREW	It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
WILLOW	Amy...?
AMY	God, you're back, I thought you said you wouldn't be gone that long.
WILLOW	I wasn't, I mean, I thought I was --
AMY	Let's go somewhere.
WILLOW	Don't you wanna go see your dad or --
AMY	No. Can't. Not yet. Too many questions.
WILLOW	About where you were.
AMY	No, about how I got there. Wish I could just make him forget about the last three years.
WILLOW	Well, hey, I can help you with that. Only, you might wanna, like, sew your name in your clothes first or something.
AMY	I just don't wanna deal with him right now, I'd be so... bored.
WILLOW	Well...
AMY	Come on, let's get outta here.
WILLOW	Well... whaddya wanna do?
AMY	I don't know. Something fun. Anything not involving a big wheel.
WILLOW	No. No, you know what? I can have fun. Heck, I deserve some fun.
AMY	Yeah you do.
WILLOW	I can party. Not like I owe anyone anything, I'm totally free. So, let's go make with the fun.
ANDREW	You're English, right?
SPIKE	Yeah.
ANDREW	I've seen every episode of Doctor Who.
JONATHAN	'Cause it's not out yet on DVD.
ANDREW	Right, it's not out yet on DVD.
WARREN	Here, here I am, got 'em.
SPIKE	Bloody hell, get on with it, then.
SPIKE	Well, there's gotta be something --
WARREN	No. No, listen, I don't know what that thing does, I mean, I'd like to --
SPIKE	If you're lying to me --
WARREN	No! No, it's right here.
SPIKE	You tell anyone about this --
WARREN	I won't. I promise. Who would I tell, I don't even know what this is all about.
SPIKE	It's about the rules having changed. Everything is different now.
DAWN	Hello! We're home!
TARA	Looks like no one's here.
DAWN	Well, they'll be back soon. I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up with Xander to do some research.
TARA	Okay, well, then I should probably get back.
DAWN	Or you could stay and wait for them, then you could have a chance to catch up with... everyone.
TARA	Yeah, I don't think that's a great idea.
DAWN	Okay, your call. I've got the TV to keep me company till they get back.
TARA	Fine, I'll stay, but just till they get back.
DAWN	Sure, cool, up to you.
WILLOW	I know. Xander engaged. I couldn't believe it either.
AMY	It's weird. What's she like?
WILLOW	Thousand year old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit-phobia.
AMY	Well that's so his type.
RYAN	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey.
AMY	Hey.
WILLOW	Oh, uh, no. You go ahead. I'll keep an eye on the drinks.
AMY	Okay. 'Cause, you know, if you want something a little more your style...
WILLOW	No, really, I'm --
WILLOW	Willow. Nice, um, dress. Thanks, but -- no.
AMY	You sure?
WILLOW	Yeah, it's not -- she's not -- I'm still...
AMY	It's cool.
SHIRLEY	Oh, I'm --uh, sorry, I...
RYAN	So are we going to --
AMY	Yeah. You sure you're okay?
WILLOW	Yeah, go. I'm all kinds of good.
WILLOW	No use looking at me like that. It's the gullet for you, mister.
AMY	Hey. Sorry, got kinda caught up.
WILLOW	No, s'okay.
AMY	You know if rats could dance, they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.
RYAN	Come on. We're just getting started.
AMY	I'm gonna sit this one out.
SIMON	Nuh-uh. You don't get us worked up like that and then just --
AMY	Hey!
WILLOW	I think she said no.
RYAN	Nobody asked you, Ellen .
AMY	You wanna dance.
RYAN	That's all. Nice, slow, relaxing dance.
WILLOW	Gee.
AMY	I think I do feel more relaxed
WILLOW	Hmmmm. Me too.
SPIKE	There. All ready.
SPIKE	Now at last, Buffy, you will come to me, and your destiny wi -- wait.
XANDER	Ah ha! I got it! Here's our villain right here.
ANYA	Sweetie, that's a D&amp;D manual.
XANDER	But, I could've... oh.
ANYA	Let's admit it -we can't find this thing because it doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds.
BUFFY	Well maybe he doesn't eat diamonds. Maybe he just... thinks they're pretty.
XANDER	We need new brains. What's up with Willow?
BUFFY	Out with Amy, I guess.
ANYA	Great. Someone to do more magic with.
BUFFY	But... she's not cooped up and crying, that's forward momentum. I don't know everything that happened with Tara, but Willow was --
XANDER	Tara thinks Willow was doing too much magic. She's not the only one.
BUFFY	I know. But I think she'll be fine. This is Willow, she of the level head
ANYA	Those are the ones you have to watch out for the most. Responsible types.
BUFFY	Right. Cause they might go all crazy and start alphabetizing everything.
ANYA	I'm serious. Responsible people try so hard to be good all the time - when they get a taste of being bad, they can't get enough. It's like - kablooey!
BUFFY	That's not true-
ANYA	Okay, not kablooey. More like BAM!
XANDER	It is human nature, Buff. Will's getting a taste of something powerful, way bigger than her.
ANYA	She was getting out of control with it before Tara left. And now that she's gone...
XANDER	It must be seductive, just to give into it. Go totally wild. We need to keep an eye on her.
BUFFY	Okay. We'll keep an eye. But we don't have to assume everybody's getting seduced. Sometimes--
SPIKE	Slayer.
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Meet me at the cemetery. Twenty minutes. Come alone.
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Bloody hell, yes, it's me.
BUFFY	You're calling me on the phone?
SPIKE	Just be there.
BUFFY	Why, are you helping again? You have a lead on the Frost Monster thingie?
SPIKE	Something like that, yeah. Kinda thought you might be up for a little grunt work.
BUFFY	What? No! No grunting.
SPIKE	I was talking shop, love. But if you've other ideas... You and me... Cozy little tomb with a view-
XANDER	What did Captain Peroxide want?
BUFFY	Nothing. He wanted to... patrol. (so awkward it sounds like she doesn't speak English very well) But I told him that I would not.
BUFFY	I'm telling you, I think there's just something about this thing.
XANDER	I dunno, Buff, feels like we've been through every book.
ANYA	Yes, even the ones that aren't so boring you want to kill yourself.
XANDER	We have those?
BUFFY	I'm just saying. All the things that've happened lately, a bank robbery, a jewel heist.
BUFFY	They just... is it me, or do they all seem really --
ANYA	Lame?
BUFFY	I was going for unusual, but yeah.
ANYA	Optimism. I remember optimism.
XANDER	That's 'cause you're a thousand.
XANDER	Night.
SPIKE	Slayer.
BUFFY	And so my night is now complete.
SPIKE	You never showed.
BUFFY	Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.
SPIKE	You shouldn't be so flip, love.
BUFFY	Why, what are you gonna do, walk behind me to death?
SPIKE	I'm just saying, things might be a little different now. You oughta be careful.
BUFFY	Enough! Enough, move.
SPIKE	Or what?
BUFFY	How?
SPIKE	Don't you get it? Don't you see?
BUFFY	It's a trick. You did something to the chip, it's a trick.
SPIKE	No trick. It's not me. It's you.
BUFFY	See? Yes it does.
WILLOW	You know, this music --it's not quite...
SPIKE	Oh, poor little lost girl.
BUFFY	Me? I'm lost? Look at you, you idiot. Poor Spikey. Can't be a human, can't be a vampire. Where the hell do you fit in?
SPIKE	I'm in love with you.
BUFFY	You're in love with pain. Admit it. You like me because you enjoy getting beat down. So who's really screwed up?
SPIKE	Hello! Vampire! I'm supposed to be treading on the dark side.
WILLOW	We've kind of played this scene.
AMY	Yeah.
WILLOW	Return.
AMY	Wait, who am I?
WILLOW	So... should we go?
AMY	I guess...
WILLOW	What?
AMY	I dunno, I guess I'm just not...
WILLOW	Done yet?
AMY	Yeah, we're just starting to have fun, I don't wanna stop now.
WILLOW	I know! Me too!
AMY	With more people.
WILLOW	Heck yeah.
AMY	Besides, it's way too early to go home yet.
WILLOW	We can still do a little more.
AMY	The night is young, the town is big. All kinds of trouble to find still.
WILLOW	I do so love the trouble.
SPIKE	I wasn't planning to hurt you. Much.
BUFFY	You haven't come close to hurting me.
SPIKE	Afraid to give me the chance?
MAN	I'm sure we can work something out.
WOMAN	A deal of some sort. Anything you want.
BUFFY	What the hell is wrong with you?
SPIKE	Ow . Thought they were demons
BUFFY	Yeah, way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.
SPIKE	Remind me not to help you.
BUFFY	More often?
SPIKE	A little sympathy for the man with the migraine, can we...
BUFFY	That's what you get for attacking a human.
SPIKE	Yeah. You'd think if the government's gonna put a chip in my head, they'd at least make it so I could attack criminals and that sort.
BUFFY	Yes, 'cause muggers deserve to be eaten. You're just gonna have to get your rocks off fighting demons, Spike.
SPIKE	There's other ways...
BUFFY	And to that an extreme see-ya-later
SPIKE	Buffy.
SPIKE	Wanna jump right to the kissing then, eh?
BUFFY	I'm not kissing you. Once was--
SPIKE	Twice.
SPIKE	You're a tease, Slayer. Know that? Get a fella's motor revvin', let the tension marinate a couple of days, then -bam! Crown yourself the Ice Queen.
BUFFY	You need any more metaphors for that li'l mix?
SPIKE	Only a matter of time before you realize. I'm the only one here for you, pet! You got no one else!
WARREN	Dude, what are you doing?
JONATHAN	We're not breaking into Langley here -it's Sunnydale.
ANDREW	Well, you never know what new stuff they have, better to be safe than --
WARREN	Okay, the security system here is a guy named Rusty.
ANDREW	Whoa, head rush. Cool.
WARREN	Guys, come on.
ANDREW	See? That's cool. How come he gets to play with all the cool stuff?
JONATHAN	'Cause I'm allergic to methane, and you're still afraid of hot things.
ANDREW	I know
JONATHAN	Besides. The tank kept making both of us tip over, remember?
JONATHAN	It's beautiful.

DAWN	Yeah, it was ironic when all those cute inner city kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.
TARA	You know I'll always be there for you, right?
DAWN	I know.
TARA	I just, I wanted you to know. My moving out had nothing to do with you, and I will never stop --
DAWN	I know.
TARA	I wish I knew.
DAWN	But you still love her.
TARA	Very much. It's just, you know. Sometimes other things get in the way.
DAWN	But, you know she misses you.
TARA	You know what's important is that you don't ever have to worry. Our stuff is our stuff, but it never touches you. We both love you, and we both will always love you.
DAWN	I know. She's doing a lot better lately, though. She's been really good about being careful. About stuff.
WILLOW	Here. Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
XANDER	He's all thawed out now. They used hair-dryers. Huh.
BUFFY	Anya?
ANYA	It's such a pain. The text I wanted? Giles took it with him. He has this thing that "owning" a book made it, like, his "property."
BUFFY	So what do we do? Call him? It's the middle of last night there. Or maybe tomorrow. Does anyone remember how that works?
WILLOW	It's okay. No one freak. We'll just do this another way.
XANDER	All right, back to basics. A little old-fashioned state-of-the-art hacker action.
BUFFY	That's great, Will. Haven't seen you do that in a long time...
WILLOW	It's quicker. It'll just take a sec to go through the files.
BUFFY	Is it a supernatural diamond? Like, all good-lucky? Or healing powers?
ANYA	Maybe it's cursed. Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
WILLOW	Well, let's do some more checking, shall we?
XANDER	Sure, but, you know, I am really beat. And I bet that's tiring, the... thing you're doing there.
WILLOW	Guys, I'm fine, really. What's the deal with --
ANYA	Oh, for crying out loud. This is bizarre. You're all la la with the magic and the not-talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you and now everyone's scared to say anything to you. Except me. Is this that thing I do that you comment on sometimes?
WILLOW	Guys, it's okay. It's hard, but -- but it's better this way, believe me. Little things started taking over, things that don't matter, but we saw them differently, and so they got blown out of proportion.
XANDER	Amy. Is she... how is she adjusting?
WILLOW	I'm not sure. It's a lot to take in. I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty stuff, licking her hands clean or shredding newspaper or making little pellets in the corner.
BUFFY	Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
JONATHAN	I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
WARREN	Yes, gentlemen, it turns out size is everything. No offense, man.
ANDREW	It makes colors with the light!
JONATHAN	Check, we're all --
ANDREW	Hello, it's called knocking.
SPIKE	Knock, knock Robot-Boy. Need you to look at my chip.
JONATHAN	Is that, like, British slang or something, 'cause we're not --
WARREN	You know, we're kind of in the middle of something.
SPIKE	You can play holodeck another time. Right now, I'm in charge.
WARREN	And what are you gonna do if we don't especially feel like playing your little-- What are you doing?
JONATHAN	Hey, all right, let's not, let's not do anything crazy...
ANDREW	That's a limited edition 1979 mint condition Boba Fett!
WARREN	All right, dude, chill. You can still make it right. You know you don't wanna do this.
SPIKE	What I want is answers, nimrod.
WARREN	Right, but, you don't wanna hurt the Fett. Cuz, man, you're not coming back from that. You don't do that and walk away.
SPIKE	That right? Let's find out.
ANDREW	Dudes! I think that's Spike!
JONATHAN	Of course it is. And he's evil. Completely capable of removing that head.
WARREN	I'm gonna help him out.
JONATHAN	Are you sure we can trust him? I mean, we all have heads too.
WARREN	We help him and he owes us one. See, we get Spike on our side, we get info on Buffy. Maybe we even find out how to keep her away from phase two.
ANDREW	But Jonathan's right, can we trust him?
WARREN	Course not, alliances aren't about trust. He needs us, we need him, it's how these things work.
SPIKE	I'm not scratching your anything. You do what I say. That's the deal. Deal?
WARREN	Deal.
SPIKE	Then let's go.
AMY	God, you're back, I thought you said you wouldn't be gone that long.
WILLOW	I wasn't, I mean, I thought I was --
AMY	Let's go somewhere.
WILLOW	Don't you wanna go see your dad or --
AMY	No. Can't. Not yet. Too many questions.
WILLOW	About where you were.
AMY	No, about how I got there. Wish I could just make him forget about the last three years.
WILLOW	Well, hey, I can help you with that. Only, you might wanna, like, sew your name in your clothes first or something.
AMY	I just don't wanna deal with him right now, I'd be so... bored.
WILLOW	Well...
AMY	Come on, let's get outta here.
WILLOW	Well... whaddya wanna do?
AMY	I don't know. Something fun. Anything not involving a big wheel.
WILLOW	No. No, you know what? I can have fun. Heck, I deserve some fun.
AMY	Yeah you do.
WILLOW	I can party. Not like I owe anyone anything, I'm totally free. So, let's go make with the fun.
JONATHAN	'Cause it's not out yet on DVD.
ANDREW	Right, it's not out yet on DVD.
WARREN	Here, here I am, got 'em.
SPIKE	Bloody hell, get on with it, then.
SPIKE	Well, there's gotta be something --
WARREN	No. No, listen, I don't know what that thing does, I mean, I'd like to --
SPIKE	If you're lying to me --
WARREN	No! No, it's right here.
SPIKE	You tell anyone about this --
WARREN	I won't. I promise. Who would I tell, I don't even know what this is all about.
SPIKE	It's about the rules having changed. Everything is different now.
DAWN	Hello! We're home!
TARA	Looks like no one's here.
DAWN	Well, they'll be back soon. I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up with Xander to do some research.
TARA	Okay, well, then I should probably get back.
DAWN	Or you could stay and wait for them, then you could have a chance to catch up with... everyone.
TARA	Yeah, I don't think that's a great idea.
DAWN	Sure, cool, up to you.
AMY	It's weird. What's she like?
WILLOW	Thousand year old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit-phobia.
RYAN	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey.
AMY	Hey.
WILLOW	Oh, uh, no. You go ahead. I'll keep an eye on the drinks.
AMY	Okay. 'Cause, you know, if you want something a little more your style...
WILLOW	Willow. Nice, um, dress. Thanks, but -- no.
AMY	You sure?
WILLOW	Yeah, it's not -- she's not -- I'm still...
AMY	It's cool.
AMY	Yeah. You sure you're okay?
WILLOW	Yeah, go. I'm all kinds of good.
WILLOW	No, s'okay.
AMY	You know if rats could dance, they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.
RYAN	Come on. We're just getting started.
AMY	I'm gonna sit this one out.
SIMON	Nuh-uh. You don't get us worked up like that and then just --
AMY	Hey!
WILLOW	I think she said no.
RYAN	Nobody asked you, Ellen .
AMY	You wanna dance.
RYAN	That's all. Nice, slow, relaxing dance.
WILLOW	Gee.
AMY	I think I do feel more relaxed
WILLOW	Hmmmm. Me too.
ANYA	Sweetie, that's a D&amp;D manual.
XANDER	But, I could've... oh.
ANYA	Let's admit it -we can't find this thing because it doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds.
BUFFY	Well maybe he doesn't eat diamonds. Maybe he just... thinks they're pretty.
XANDER	We need new brains. What's up with Willow?
BUFFY	Out with Amy, I guess.
ANYA	Great. Someone to do more magic with.
BUFFY	But... she's not cooped up and crying, that's forward momentum. I don't know everything that happened with Tara, but Willow was --
XANDER	Tara thinks Willow was doing too much magic. She's not the only one.
BUFFY	I know. But I think she'll be fine. This is Willow, she of the level head
ANYA	Those are the ones you have to watch out for the most. Responsible types.
BUFFY	Right. Cause they might go all crazy and start alphabetizing everything.
ANYA	I'm serious. Responsible people try so hard to be good all the time - when they get a taste of being bad, they can't get enough. It's like - kablooey!
BUFFY	That's not true-
ANYA	Okay, not kablooey. More like BAM!
XANDER	It is human nature, Buff. Will's getting a taste of something powerful, way bigger than her.
ANYA	She was getting out of control with it before Tara left. And now that she's gone...
XANDER	It must be seductive, just to give into it. Go totally wild. We need to keep an eye on her.
BUFFY	Okay. We'll keep an eye. But we don't have to assume everybody's getting seduced. Sometimes--
SPIKE	Slayer.
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Meet me at the cemetery. Twenty minutes. Come alone.
SPIKE	Bloody hell, yes, it's me.
BUFFY	You're calling me on the phone?
SPIKE	Just be there.
BUFFY	Why, are you helping again? You have a lead on the Frost Monster thingie?
SPIKE	Something like that, yeah. Kinda thought you might be up for a little grunt work.
BUFFY	What? No! No grunting.
SPIKE	I was talking shop, love. But if you've other ideas... You and me... Cozy little tomb with a view-
XANDER	What did Captain Peroxide want?
BUFFY	Nothing. He wanted to... patrol. (so awkward it sounds like she doesn't speak English very well) But I told him that I would not.
BUFFY	I'm telling you, I think there's just something about this thing.
XANDER	I dunno, Buff, feels like we've been through every book.
ANYA	Yes, even the ones that aren't so boring you want to kill yourself.
XANDER	We have those?
BUFFY	I'm just saying. All the things that've happened lately, a bank robbery, a jewel heist.
BUFFY	They just... is it me, or do they all seem really --
ANYA	Lame?
BUFFY	I was going for unusual, but yeah.
ANYA	Optimism. I remember optimism.
XANDER	That's 'cause you're a thousand.
XANDER	Night.
SPIKE	Slayer.
BUFFY	And so my night is now complete.
SPIKE	You never showed.
BUFFY	Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.
SPIKE	You shouldn't be so flip, love.
BUFFY	Why, what are you gonna do, walk behind me to death?
BUFFY	Enough! Enough, move.
SPIKE	Or what?
BUFFY	How?
SPIKE	Don't you get it? Don't you see?
BUFFY	It's a trick. You did something to the chip, it's a trick.
SPIKE	No trick. It's not me. It's you.
SPIKE	I'm in love with you.
BUFFY	You're in love with pain. Admit it. You like me because you enjoy getting beat down. So who's really screwed up?
SPIKE	Hello! Vampire! I'm supposed to be treading on the dark side.
WILLOW	We've kind of played this scene.
AMY	Yeah.
WILLOW	So... should we go?
AMY	I guess...
WILLOW	What?
AMY	I dunno, I guess I'm just not...
WILLOW	Done yet?
AMY	Yeah, we're just starting to have fun, I don't wanna stop now.
WILLOW	I know! Me too!
AMY	With more people.
WILLOW	Heck yeah.
AMY	Besides, it's way too early to go home yet.
WILLOW	We can still do a little more.
AMY	The night is young, the town is big. All kinds of trouble to find still.
SPIKE	I wasn't planning to hurt you. Much.
BUFFY	You haven't come close to hurting me.
SPIKE	Afraid to give me the chance?

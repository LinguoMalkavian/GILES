GILES	Now, you're sure you'll all be all right here?
DAWN	You'll only be gone for two days.
BUFFY	I think we've managed without you for a bit longer than that.
GILES	Right. Well, thank goodness I needn't worry myself with the idea of bad things happening in my absence. You getting shot, for example. Or throwing everyone in the basement and trying to kill them. Or Willow turning evil...
DAWN	Oooh, don't forget, Anya turned evil, too.
BUFFY	Okay, just leave.
GILES	Dawn, Vi left her notebook there next to the TV. Would you mind taking it out to her in the car?
DAWN	Sure.
GILES	And maybe whack her in the head with it as a reminder not to leave it lying all about?
DAWN	On it.
GILES	I'm a bit twitchy about leaving you alone again with things in such a state of flux.
BUFFY	I know - but you should go. The girls need this trip to understand the source of their power. And to know how to use it right.
GILES	I don't think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking. How frightening and difficult it is. Apparently somebody told them that the visionquest consists of me taking them into the desert and doing the hokey pokey until a "spooky rasta mama Slayer" appears and talks to them in riddles.
BUFFY	That's not exactly the way I put it-
WILLOW	Still flu-ey. Bummed about missing the field trip. She wants you to meditate extra hard for her. And maybe bring her back s'mores.
GILES	Yes. S'mores. I'm going to end up singing campfire songs, aren't I?
XANDER	Giles, you might wanna get out there.
GILES	Oh, god, what...
DAWN	Molly and Rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg.
BUFFY	Betcha now you wish you'd renewed that California driver's license.
ANYA	Rona won. You should probably let Molly out of the trunk.
GILES	Please be safe while I'm away.
BUFFY	Yes. You too.
BUFFY	Spike...?
SPIKE	Yeah.
BUFFY	Giles is off. On the retreat. Said to say goodbye.
SPIKE	Yeah, he's gonna miss me ever so. But gives us all a breather, eh?
BUFFY	From Giles?
SPIKE	From the constant pitter-patter of clomping teenage girlie feet.
BUFFY	I have no idea what you mean.
SPIKE	Oh, come off it.
BUFFY	I enjoy my responsibilities as mentor and, and role model and life guide and oh my god, I can't believe I have my bathroom back for two whole days!
SPIKE	It's like a bloody war zone up there. And not in the fun way.
BUFFY	And have you seen the kitchen since they got here?
SPIKE	I'm just trying to stay out of their way.
BUFFY	I noticed.
SPIKE	This is better, believe me. Safer.
BUFFY	Okay. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls.
SPIKE	With you at my side, yeah. You'd never let me hurt one of 'em. And that's how it's gonna be until we're sure The First is done making me its bitch. We're together or I'm on the leash.
BUFFY	So we find a way to make sure the trigger is deactivated. We've got a couple of days. Lack of pitter- patter and all. Maybe-
SPIKE	Buffy...
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Ow.
BUFFY	Ow?
SPIKE	Ow . Ow!
BUFFY	Spike? Spike ?
SPIKE	I don't... god. Why would...
BUFFY	What's happening, what are you --
WILLOW	Hey. How is he?
BUFFY	In the "goes" part of comes and goes.
WILLOW	There seems to be a definite lack of screaming, that has to be good.
BUFFY	You'd think... That for the other patient?
WILLOW	Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.
BUFFY	Hmmm.
WILLOW	It's just tea.
BUFFY	Will?
WILLOW	Spike's chip? Only the stuff I could dig up that hadn't been buried by The Initiative. So, you know. About zero. Why?
BUFFY	It's just...
WILLOW	You think this is chip-related? Buffy, did he try to --
BUFFY	No. No, no, he was fine. That's what's weird. He said it felt like chip pain, but he wasn't... he didn't do anything.
WILLOW	The chip is misfiring all on its own then.
BUFFY	Yeah. Imagine that. An ex of mine with a mysterious, pain-inducing problem. Remember when things used to be nice and boring?
WILLOW	No.
BUFFY	Have fun delivering the tea.
WILLOW	Okay, not when you make it sound all dirty like that.
WILLOW	Hey, I figured the best thing for a cold was probably a nice, hot cup of... boots.
KENNEDY	Hey.
WILLOW	For someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust. And casual- dressy.
KENNEDY	Well, the lighting in here is good, maybe it's just --
WILLOW	You were never sick.
KENNEDY	No. I was never sick.
WILLOW	Oh! You are so busted, Xander's gonna hafta drive you to the desert now --
KENNEDY	Willow. Chill. There's a reason I didn't go. I have a thing. A separate thing.
WILLOW	What...
KENNEDY	Something's coming down. I've got my own mission. And I need your help.
WILLOW	This is a mission?
KENNEDY	Oh, yeah.
WILLOW	And, I guess the little paper umbrellas in the drinks are, what, a signal for... we're not on a mission, are we?
KENNEDY	Hey, trust me. I told you, I have a thing.
WILLOW	No, this is a fun thing, I've done this thing!
KENNEDY	Well, yeah, in like l954.
WILLOW	Why do you do that?
KENNEDY	To get you to stay.
WILLOW	I will stay for one drink. Just to keep you company. Then I'm going home.
KENNEDY	Okay, one drink. I can work with that. Let's start with the easy stuff. How long have you known?
WILLOW	Wait, wait, that's easy? And, hey, you just assume that I'm... that I'm gay? I mean, presume much?
KENNEDY	Okay, sorry. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?
WILLOW	Hey! What do you think, you have some kind of, like, special lesbi-dar or something?
KENNEDY	Okay, you know there's a better word for that, right? You really haven't been getting out there that much, have you?
WILLOW	I just... what, can you always tell? Just from looking at someone?
KENNEDY	No. No, of course not. That wouldn't be any fun.
WILLOW	Three years ago. That's when I knew. And it wasn't women. It was woman. Just one.
KENNEDY	Lucky woman.
BUFFY	So, I had to dig a little bit for a clean towel, seems we've completely lost control of --
SPIKE	Popped another blood vessel, I think.
BUFFY	There must be a reason why the chip is going all wonky now, maybe it's related to the trigger, or it's, like, interference from the new soul thing, or --
SPIKE	Or maybe I just wasn't supposed to last this long.
BUFFY	Okay. Okay, well, we'll fix it. We'll get the gang on it, we'll hit serious research mode --
SPIKE	Good. Try "behavioral modification software through the ages."
BUFFY	You're right, it's not a book thing. It's a phone thing.
SPIKE	Who you gonna call? God, that phrase is never gonna be usable again, is it?
BUFFY	Doubt it. Hang tight.
KENNEDY	It was Gone With the Wind. I saw that, and I knew I wanted to sweep Scarlett off her feet.
WILLOW	You were five.
KENNEDY	I'm not saying the sweeping would have been easy.
WILLOW	No, it's just... I still can't figure it out. Why you... like me. You don't even know me.
KENNEDY	What, are you fishing for compliments now?
WILLOW	No! I --
KENNEDY	Willow. I don't know. Have you seen you?
WILLOW	I don't like any of those things. Except the fighting evil part. And even then I'd prefer a nice foot massage.
KENNEDY	Okay... I dig the way you always turn off the Moulin Rouge DVD at chapter 32 so it has a happy ending. (becoming serious) I like the way you speak. It's interesting. And your freckles. Lickable. I'm not so into the magic stuff. Seems like fairy tale crap to me. But it matters to you. You care about it. So it's cool.
WILLOW	Did your parents freak out?
KENNEDY	Not as bad as they did when my Watcher showed up. Now that was a blowout... but the gay thing... they're pretty cool about me being me. Besides, my brother's a vegan, so he takes most of the heat.
WILLOW	Yeah. My mom was all proud, 'cause she thought I was making a political statement. Then the statement mojo wore off, and I was just gay... she hardly ever even met Tara.
KENNEDY	Classic.
WILLOW	I didn't mind. Tara and I are sort of... private.
KENNEDY	I'm sorry. It must have be-
WILLOW	Were, I mean. Private.
BUFFY	Yes. Agent Finn. Riley. Tell him we're having a problem with Spike's chip. No, his chip. Spike.
SPIKE	Listen, pet...
BUFFY	Yeah, Finn's his last -- Well, did he used to work there, did he get transferred recently, or... Oh. Okay.
I	know it's really Secret Ops?
SPIKE	This one seemed easier than the others. See? Probably just gonna fade...
WILLOW	Well. This is my stop.
KENNEDY	Yes. Kinda cleared the air, huh?
WILLOW	Totally. Air, cleared. Check.
KENNEDY	You know, in the spirit of air- clearing...
WILLOW	Yeah?
KENNEDY	I feel like I need to be honest about something.
WILLOW	Oh. Is something...
KENNEDY	No, no, it's just. I think you should know...
WILLOW	Okay, you all right? Not used to literally knocking girls off their feet with just the power of my lips.
KENNEDY	I don't... what are you...
WILLOW	Is this another freckle thing, 'cause --
KENNEDY	What is that?
WILLOW	It's the man I killed.
KENNEDY	Okay, hold up a sec...
WILLOW	Guys.
XANDER	Get Buffy! Get Buffy! Tell her The First is back!
WILLOW	What? No, I'm not The First --
ANYA	We're not interested in your evil lies. We've heard them all. Well, they have, you didn't actually visit me with lies. But I heard about it! Buffy! Basement! Go!
WILLOW	I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on. Ask Kennedy, she was there.
KENNEDY	I don't know, I'm not sure. We were up in Willow's room, and we were-
WILLOW	Okay, no! Don't ask Kennedy. Wrong. No Kennedy-asking. Let's try another approach...
ANDREW	No. No, no, no, you're back...
WILLOW	No, I'm not. It's . Not. I'm not it! Listen to me --
ANDREW	No, no more listening! I know who you are now. I know what you made me do.
KENNEDY	Just... what the hell is going on?
ANDREW	Your promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work on me anymore.
ANYA	Buffy !
XANDER	There're probably Bringers coming, we have to --
WILLOW	I'm not The First.
ANDREW	You made me do things. Things I can't take back. Ever.
WILLOW	I'm not The First!
BUFFY	Ow!
SPIKE	Buffy...
ANYA	Wait...
DAWN	But if he's The First...
WILLOW	I'm not The First!
XANDER	You're not The First!
WILLOW	I know!!!
ANDREW	Oh my god.
WILLOW	Hey! Bad touching.
KENNEDY	It's Willow.
WILLOW	I'm Willow.
XANDER	Are you sure?
WILLOW	You know, there are other stories from kindergarten, non-yellow-crayon stories, in which you don't come out in such a good light. An incident involving Aquaman Underoos, for example. Want me to start talkin'?
XANDER	Hey! Willow!
BUFFY	What happened?
WILLOW	I don't know. We were... we were there. And then I looked like him.
ANYA	Like a glamour.
WILLOW	Maybe. I probably brought it on myself.
BUFFY	What makes you think that?
WILLOW	Wouldn't be the first time. I kinda have a history with my witchy subconscious making things go kerfloofy. Remember the wacky "I can't see you, you can't see me" spell? Hijinks ensued.
BUFFY	Guys.
ANDREW	It's so real...
WILLOW	All too aware.
BUFFY	Say you're right. You did this to yourself. Why would your subconscious turn you into Warren?
WILLOW	Well, obviously because I... feel bad. About... killing him.
BUFFY	Got it. So we'll deal. We'll help.
WILLOW	No. I can handle this.
BUFFY	On your own? Why?
WILLOW	I did it. I'll fix it. And I don't want you seeing me this way.
BUFFY	Kinda too late, Will.
WILLOW	Seriously, I'm not posing any big threat to the world. And it looks like you've got your hands full already.
SPIKE	Buffy...
BUFFY	I'm right here.
SPIKE	Chip fired again.
BUFFY	Kinda figured.
XANDER	What do you need?
SPIKE	Just gimme some space. I'm gonna be fine.
DAWN	These things are getting worse, not better.
SPIKE	I know.
ANYA	Oooh! That was a joke!
BUFFY	Maybe they'll call back. Send help.
SPIKE	Maybe we can't wait.
KENNEDY	Okay, safe to say no one will ever accuse you of being too butch.
WILLOW	Kennedy, go home.
KENNEDY	Come on. You turned into a guy! If you take a step back, seriously, there's a certain element of humor here, right?
WILLOW	I killed him. It's hard to see the chuckles.
KENNEDY	So, you got a plan?
WILLOW	Yup. Gonna get some help reversing it.
KENNEDY	I thought you were gonna try it yourself --
WILLOW	I did try. Didn't work. Something's... blocking me.
KENNEDY	All the more reason for me to go with you. Plus, I was there with you when it happened. Let me come and try to help, too.
WILLOW	I really think I'm fine with the handling.
KENNEDY	By yourself? Why?
WILLOW	Well, see above re; I'm the one who killed him.
KENNEDY	Given. How about if I just tag along anyway? Keep you company.
WILLOW	Fine. Come.
KENNEDY	You know where you're going?
WILLOW	To find some old friends of mine. Been awhile, but maybe they can help.
ANDREW	Okay, are things always that wackadoo around here?
ANYA	Ha! Newbie.
XANDER	I don't know what things are like in Houses of Evil, my young friend, but around here, that was kind of nothing.
ANDREW	Really? 'Cause it seemed like a lot was happening all at once. You guys aren't wicked exhausted?
DAWN	You sat around and watched bad things happen to other people. That's exhausting?
ANDREW	I'm very sensitive to the emotional pain of others, I found it draining.
ANYA	I thought you were exhausted --
ANDREW	I'm supposed to get a call when the new League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comes in. I gave them this number.
XANDER	Oh, see if you can get two -- Loser.
ANDREW	Summers' residence, this is Andrew speaking, how can I help you?
XANDER	He was attacked. This guy Robson. In England. Giles was there, helping him, and there was a Bringer...
ANYA	Xander.
XANDER	Robson blacked out. Last thing he remembers, Giles' head was about to get real familiar with the Bringer's very sharp axe.
DAWN	Oh my god.
ANYA	Giles never mentioned any of this.
XANDER	Robson said that by the time he came to, no Giles.
DAWN	So what are we saying...
XANDER	Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.
ANYA	Or maybe he didn't make it.
XANDER	Because if you wanted to infiltrate the inner circle of the Slayer...
ANYA	You become the one person she trusts more than anyone else.
DAWN	But there's no way we can know...
ANDREW	Actually, that's not true.
ANYA	Well, it's not like Giles hasn't touched anything... right?
ANDREW	Where are you --
XANDER	Desert. We're gonna find Giles.
ANDREW	Oh, good, lemme just get some tapes for the car, I've been working on this mix --
XANDER	You're not coming.
ANDREW	What? Why? 'Cause I used to be evil?
XANDER	Well, actually, no, 'cause you're annoying, but, yeah, that's a good reason, too.
ANDREW	Wait, don't leave me here all alone, I keep getting attacked in this house.
DAWN	Actually, Xand...
ANDREW	What if this is all part of the plan, drive you away so it can have its way with me, ever think of that?
XANDER	I'll risk it.
ANDREW	Okay, well, if you leave me here alone, I'll do something evil. Like... burning something. Or gluing things together.
ANYA	For crying out loud, Harris, just take him. Least we can keep an eye on him.
XANDER	I know. They're out there alone with him. All of them.
VAUGHNE	Instill us, O Great One, with peace, with strength, with compassion, with hope.
WILLOW	Okay, that's new.
VAUGHNE	Um, hi, we're...
WILLOW	Oh. Hey. I'm sorry. Willow. We actually met when I was a freshman. And, also, not a boy. This is Kennedy.
KENNEDY	Hey.
VAUGHNE	You're Willow?
WILLOW	Yeah.
VAUGHNE	No, we still do those, too, second Tuesday of every month, I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time with the whole guy of it --
AMY	I can tell.
WILLOW	Okay, whoa.
AMY	Um... okay. Here's the thing. Hi. Here's the thing, let's get this out of the way, I'm sorta screwed up.
VAUGHNE	But she's doing so much better. Amy...
AMY	Vaughne, it's okay, I wanna do this. (to Willow) It took me a while to really see myself. But I did.
KENNEDY	That's what we're here to find out. (looking at Willow) I mean, if we're done with all the group hugging.
WILLOW	I got hit with this, like, glamour. And I can't seem to shake it myself.
AMY	Yeah, the thing is, we're mostly about healing spirits and nurturing our life force here.
WILLOW	Oh.
AMY	But we'll try.
SPIKE	Guess here we are.
BUFFY	Yup. Here are we.
SPIKE	You sure you still wanna go back in this place with me?
BUFFY	Eh. Nothing good on TV tonight.
SPIKE	Dunno. Worked pretty good when I was living in residence here. Any time I got a little... rambunctious, the chip would kick in, I'd feel like my head was gonna explode, they'd dope me up, and everything would be all daffodils and teddy bears. For a couple hours, anyway.
BUFFY	I'm... maybe we should look around for files and stuff, too. We can learn about the chip, its shelf life.
SPIKE	I'll take whatever we can get.
BUFFY	Ready?
AMY	...her spirit true, its shell a lie, we draw upon your very might... KENNEDY (to Vaughne/re: Amy) What if she can't handle this?
VAUGHNE	You've got a better idea?
AMY	Give back the form the soul requires, see that the balance is put right.
WILLOW	Aaaauuugghh!!
AMY	It didn't work?
WILLOW	No, it didn't, you dumb bitch.
KENNEDY	Willow.
AMY	You... you slapped me.
WILLOW	No. I, I didn't. It wasn't me.
KENNEDY	Willow! Willow!
WILLOW	Upset? Upset ?!? Are you just tuning in, did you not see that? I'm turning into him. It's not a trick, it's not a glamour, I'm becoming him. A murderous, misogynist man . Do you understand what he did? What I could do? I killed him for a reason .
KENNEDY	Getting angry isn't helping. We can still try to-
WILLOW	You understand nothing about magic. And in case you didn't notice, our "date" is over.
KENNEDY	Willow --
BUFFY	Oh god.
SPIKE	Yeah. You never really get used to that smell, do you?
BUFFY	Guess not.
SPIKE	Buffy.
BUFFY	Casualties in Adam's final battle here.
SPIKE	They just sealed the place off. Left everything as it was.
BUFFY	I'm thinking brief stay.
SPIKE	Yeah, you're not wrong.
ANDREW	Okay. I'll go. R.
ANYA	How long since they left?
XANDER	Few hours.
ANYA	If it's The First -- and I'm not saying it is, but... What are we expecting to find?
DAWN	You've got a group of Slayers-in- training stranded out in the middle of the desert...
XANDER	You didn't bring 'em out there to meditate.
ANDREW	Kinda makes you grateful you're not a Potential after all, doesn't it. Safer.
ANYA	Yeah, well, not so fast with the big whew.
XANDER	He might know we're coming.
ANYA	Which means we're already too late, we're heading out to the middle of nowhere --
DAWN	With no Slayer, no powerful witch...
ANYA	Just a teenager, a powerless former demon and two big geeks.
ANDREW	Okay. License plate game, maybe?
WILLOW	Look at me. Crying like a girl.
SPIKE	You hear that?
BUFFY	Yup.
SPIKE	Think something survived?
BUFFY	Looks like.
SPIKE	You see where?
BUFFY	No. Sounded like it was over there...
KENNEDY	Where'd they go?
AMY	Took off. That was a little too creepy. Even for us.
KENNEDY	I never said I was a Potential Slayer.
AMY	Oh. No, I think you did, when you guys first showed up, you told us --
KENNEDY	No. I didn't.
AMY	Oops.
SPIKE	Oh god, no. Not now.
BUFFY	Spike!
SHOPKEEPER	So, same model as last time?
WILLOW	You'd be amazed.
GILES	Gah!
XANDER	Touch him!
DAWN	I feel him! I feel him!
XANDER	Me too.
ANDREW	Me too!
GILES	Yes. Good. We all feel each other. (pointed/to Andrew) Including those of us who don't really know each other well enough to take such liberties.
ANYA	We thought you might be non-corporeal evil.
DAWN	We got a call. We couldn't remember you touching anything.
XANDER	We had to come make sure you were okay. We were worried.
GILES	Well, I... I really don't know what to... Wait, let me understand. You thought I was evil because I took a group of young girls on a camping trip and didn't touch them??
ANDREW	I don't get it.
BUFFY	Spike! Spike!
SPIKE	What's happening...?
GENERAL	Ms. Summers. Agent Finn reported that you tried to contact him earlier today.
BUFFY	Ha! Government conspiracy, I knew it!
GENERAL	He indicated you might be needing our assistance. We're to provide you anything you need to help Ass-face here.
GENERAL	Med team tells me they took a look at the chip, ma'am. You were right, it's degraded. Leave it as it is much longer, it'll be fatal to him.
BUFFY	Okay. How long until --
GENERAL	Now, ma'am.
BUFFY	Right. Of course What do we do next?
GENERAL	Agent Finn said it was your call, ma'am.
BUFFY	My... what was my call?
GENERAL	All decisions regarding Hostile Seventeen are to be left in your hands.
KENNEDY	You. You did this to her.
AMY	Guilty.
KENNEDY	What did you do to her?
AMY	What, to Willow? Oh. Just your standard Penance Malediction is all.
KENNEDY	Penance? For what, kissing me?
AMY	Wait, seriously? It happened when she... (laughing to herself) Nah, I planted the spell months ago after that whole "end of the world" routine... All I had to do was wait for her to punish herself. -- The spell just took her thoughts and powers and made them manifest. Turned out much better than I thought it would. That kiss musta been a whopper. Nice going, you must be good.
KENNEDY	All right, listen. You've had your fun. Now undo it. Let her out.
AMY	Okay. Oh, wait, I forgot. No.
KENNEDY	Why would you do this to her? You really hate her that much?
AMY	This isn't about hate. It's about power.
KENNEDY	Fun? She's disappearing, fading away in that... creep, and you think it's fun?
AMY	It was just a game. It's not my fault she's losing herself.
KENNEDY	I'm gonna stop you now, you know.
AMY	Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. I wonder where he'd be right about now?
KENNEDY	Well, that was a hell of a thing.
WILLOW	You think you can just do that to me? That I'd let you get away with it?
KENNEDY	Do... get away with what?
WILLOW	It's too late, this is what I am. I made it happen, I'll make it stop.
KENNEDY	Willow, what did you make happen?
WILLOW	You were there, bitch, you saw it! I killed her!
KENNEDY	You mean him.
WILLOW	Him! Her! You know what I mean...
KENNEDY	But you said her.
WILLOW	No. That was Warren --
KENNEDY	No. No, it wasn't, you said I was there. Who did you kill, Willow?
WILLOW	It was your fault. Slut. You tricked me, got me to forget.
KENNEDY	Tara...
WILLOW	Shut up! Shut! Up! You do not get to say her name! Offering it up to whoever's there. Tricking me into kissing you...
KENNEDY	Kissing me didn't mean -
WILLOW	No, she was never gone, she was with me, we should have been forever... and I... I let her be dead. She's really dead.
KENNEDY	Willow, no.
WILLOW	Oh, baby, I'm so sorry... don't leave me again, baby, come back, I'm sorry, come back.
KENNEDY	Willow.
WILLOW	What are you doing?
KENNEDY	Bringing you back to life.
WILLOW	It's me? I'm back?
KENNEDY	You all right?
WILLOW	I have no idea.
KENNEDY	Yeah I'll make you some tea.
GILES	Now, you're sure you'll all be all right here?
DAWN	You'll only be gone for two days.
BUFFY	I think we've managed without you for a bit longer than that.
GILES	Right. Well, thank goodness I needn't worry myself with the idea of bad things happening in my absence. You getting shot, for example. Or throwing everyone in the basement and trying to kill them. Or Willow turning evil...
DAWN	Oooh, don't forget, Anya turned evil, too.
BUFFY	Okay, just leave.
GILES	Dawn, Vi left her notebook there next to the TV. Would you mind taking it out to her in the car?
DAWN	Sure.
GILES	And maybe whack her in the head with it as a reminder not to leave it lying all about?
DAWN	On it.
GILES	I'm a bit twitchy about leaving you alone again with things in such a state of flux.
BUFFY	I know - but you should go. The girls need this trip to understand the source of their power. And to know how to use it right.
GILES	I don't think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking. How frightening and difficult it is. Apparently somebody told them that the visionquest consists of me taking them into the desert and doing the hokey pokey until a "spooky rasta mama Slayer" appears and talks to them in riddles.
BUFFY	That's not exactly the way I put it-
WILLOW	Still flu-ey. Bummed about missing the field trip. She wants you to meditate extra hard for her. And maybe bring her back s'mores.
GILES	Yes. S'mores. I'm going to end up singing campfire songs, aren't I?
XANDER	Giles, you might wanna get out there.
GILES	Oh, god, what...
DAWN	Molly and Rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg.
BUFFY	Betcha now you wish you'd renewed that California driver's license.
BUFFY	Giles is off. On the retreat. Said to say goodbye.
SPIKE	Yeah, he's gonna miss me ever so. But gives us all a breather, eh?
BUFFY	From Giles?
SPIKE	From the constant pitter-patter of clomping teenage girlie feet.
BUFFY	I have no idea what you mean.
SPIKE	Oh, come off it.
BUFFY	I enjoy my responsibilities as mentor and, and role model and life guide and oh my god, I can't believe I have my bathroom back for two whole days!
SPIKE	It's like a bloody war zone up there. And not in the fun way.
BUFFY	And have you seen the kitchen since they got here?
SPIKE	I'm just trying to stay out of their way.
BUFFY	I noticed.
SPIKE	This is better, believe me. Safer.
BUFFY	Okay. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls.
SPIKE	With you at my side, yeah. You'd never let me hurt one of 'em. And that's how it's gonna be until we're sure The First is done making me its bitch. We're together or I'm on the leash.
BUFFY	So we find a way to make sure the trigger is deactivated. We've got a couple of days. Lack of pitter- patter and all. Maybe-
SPIKE	Buffy...
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Ow.
BUFFY	Ow?
SPIKE	Ow . Ow!
BUFFY	In the "goes" part of comes and goes.
WILLOW	There seems to be a definite lack of screaming, that has to be good.
BUFFY	You'd think... That for the other patient?
WILLOW	Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.
BUFFY	Hmmm.
WILLOW	It's just tea.
WILLOW	Spike's chip? Only the stuff I could dig up that hadn't been buried by The Initiative. So, you know. About zero. Why?
BUFFY	It's just...
WILLOW	You think this is chip-related? Buffy, did he try to --
BUFFY	No. No, no, he was fine. That's what's weird. He said it felt like chip pain, but he wasn't... he didn't do anything.
WILLOW	The chip is misfiring all on its own then.
BUFFY	Yeah. Imagine that. An ex of mine with a mysterious, pain-inducing problem. Remember when things used to be nice and boring?
WILLOW	No.
BUFFY	Have fun delivering the tea.
WILLOW	Okay, not when you make it sound all dirty like that.
KENNEDY	Hey.
WILLOW	For someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust. And casual- dressy.
KENNEDY	Well, the lighting in here is good, maybe it's just --
WILLOW	You were never sick.
KENNEDY	No. I was never sick.
WILLOW	Oh! You are so busted, Xander's gonna hafta drive you to the desert now --
KENNEDY	Willow. Chill. There's a reason I didn't go. I have a thing. A separate thing.
WILLOW	What...
KENNEDY	Something's coming down. I've got my own mission. And I need your help.
WILLOW	This is a mission?
KENNEDY	Oh, yeah.
WILLOW	And, I guess the little paper umbrellas in the drinks are, what, a signal for... we're not on a mission, are we?
KENNEDY	Hey, trust me. I told you, I have a thing.
WILLOW	No, this is a fun thing, I've done this thing!
KENNEDY	Well, yeah, in like l954.
WILLOW	Why do you do that?
KENNEDY	To get you to stay.
WILLOW	Wait, wait, that's easy? And, hey, you just assume that I'm... that I'm gay? I mean, presume much?
KENNEDY	Okay, sorry. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?
WILLOW	Hey! What do you think, you have some kind of, like, special lesbi-dar or something?
WILLOW	I just... what, can you always tell? Just from looking at someone?
KENNEDY	No. No, of course not. That wouldn't be any fun.
BUFFY	There must be a reason why the chip is going all wonky now, maybe it's related to the trigger, or it's, like, interference from the new soul thing, or --
SPIKE	Or maybe I just wasn't supposed to last this long.
BUFFY	Okay. Okay, well, we'll fix it. We'll get the gang on it, we'll hit serious research mode --
SPIKE	Good. Try "behavioral modification software through the ages."
BUFFY	You're right, it's not a book thing. It's a phone thing.
SPIKE	Who you gonna call? God, that phrase is never gonna be usable again, is it?
BUFFY	Doubt it. Hang tight.
KENNEDY	It was Gone With the Wind. I saw that, and I knew I wanted to sweep Scarlett off her feet.
WILLOW	You were five.
KENNEDY	I'm not saying the sweeping would have been easy.
WILLOW	No, it's just... I still can't figure it out. Why you... like me. You don't even know me.
KENNEDY	What, are you fishing for compliments now?
WILLOW	No! I --
KENNEDY	Willow. I don't know. Have you seen you?
WILLOW	I don't like any of those things. Except the fighting evil part. And even then I'd prefer a nice foot massage.
KENNEDY	Okay... I dig the way you always turn off the Moulin Rouge DVD at chapter 32 so it has a happy ending. (becoming serious) I like the way you speak. It's interesting. And your freckles. Lickable. I'm not so into the magic stuff. Seems like fairy tale crap to me. But it matters to you. You care about it. So it's cool.
WILLOW	Did your parents freak out?
KENNEDY	Not as bad as they did when my Watcher showed up. Now that was a blowout... but the gay thing... they're pretty cool about me being me. Besides, my brother's a vegan, so he takes most of the heat.
WILLOW	Yeah. My mom was all proud, 'cause she thought I was making a political statement. Then the statement mojo wore off, and I was just gay... she hardly ever even met Tara.
KENNEDY	Classic.
WILLOW	I didn't mind. Tara and I are sort of... private.
KENNEDY	I'm sorry. It must have be-
WILLOW	Were, I mean. Private.
BUFFY	Yes. Agent Finn. Riley. Tell him we're having a problem with Spike's chip. No, his chip. Spike.
SPIKE	Listen, pet...
BUFFY	Yeah, Finn's his last -- Well, did he used to work there, did he get transferred recently, or... Oh. Okay.
SPIKE	This one seemed easier than the others. See? Probably just gonna fade...
KENNEDY	Yes. Kinda cleared the air, huh?
WILLOW	Totally. Air, cleared. Check.
KENNEDY	You know, in the spirit of air- clearing...
WILLOW	Yeah?
KENNEDY	I feel like I need to be honest about something.
WILLOW	Oh. Is something...
KENNEDY	No, no, it's just. I think you should know...
KENNEDY	I don't... what are you...
WILLOW	Is this another freckle thing, 'cause --
XANDER	Get Buffy! Get Buffy! Tell her The First is back!
WILLOW	What? No, I'm not The First --
ANYA	We're not interested in your evil lies. We've heard them all. Well, they have, you didn't actually visit me with lies. But I heard about it! Buffy! Basement! Go!
WILLOW	I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on. Ask Kennedy, she was there.
KENNEDY	I don't know, I'm not sure. We were up in Willow's room, and we were-
WILLOW	Okay, no! Don't ask Kennedy. Wrong. No Kennedy-asking. Let's try another approach...
ANDREW	No. No, no, no, you're back...
WILLOW	No, I'm not. It's . Not. I'm not it! Listen to me --
ANDREW	No, no more listening! I know who you are now. I know what you made me do.
KENNEDY	Just... what the hell is going on?
ANDREW	Your promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work on me anymore.
ANYA	Buffy !
XANDER	There're probably Bringers coming, we have to --
WILLOW	I'm not The First.
ANDREW	You made me do things. Things I can't take back. Ever.
WILLOW	I'm not The First!
SPIKE	Buffy...
ANYA	Wait...
WILLOW	I'm not The First!
XANDER	You're not The First!
WILLOW	I know!!!
KENNEDY	It's Willow.
WILLOW	I'm Willow.
XANDER	Are you sure?
WILLOW	You know, there are other stories from kindergarten, non-yellow-crayon stories, in which you don't come out in such a good light. An incident involving Aquaman Underoos, for example. Want me to start talkin'?
XANDER	Hey! Willow!
BUFFY	What happened?
WILLOW	I don't know. We were... we were there. And then I looked like him.
ANYA	Like a glamour.
WILLOW	Maybe. I probably brought it on myself.
BUFFY	What makes you think that?
WILLOW	Wouldn't be the first time. I kinda have a history with my witchy subconscious making things go kerfloofy. Remember the wacky "I can't see you, you can't see me" spell? Hijinks ensued.
BUFFY	Guys.
ANDREW	It's so real...
WILLOW	All too aware.
BUFFY	Say you're right. You did this to yourself. Why would your subconscious turn you into Warren?
WILLOW	Well, obviously because I... feel bad. About... killing him.
BUFFY	Got it. So we'll deal. We'll help.
WILLOW	No. I can handle this.
BUFFY	On your own? Why?
WILLOW	I did it. I'll fix it. And I don't want you seeing me this way.
BUFFY	Kinda too late, Will.
SPIKE	Buffy...
BUFFY	I'm right here.
SPIKE	Chip fired again.
BUFFY	Kinda figured.
XANDER	What do you need?
SPIKE	Just gimme some space. I'm gonna be fine.
DAWN	These things are getting worse, not better.
SPIKE	I know.
ANYA	Oooh! That was a joke!
BUFFY	Maybe they'll call back. Send help.
SPIKE	Maybe we can't wait.
KENNEDY	So, you got a plan?
WILLOW	Yup. Gonna get some help reversing it.
KENNEDY	I thought you were gonna try it yourself --
WILLOW	I did try. Didn't work. Something's... blocking me.
KENNEDY	All the more reason for me to go with you. Plus, I was there with you when it happened. Let me come and try to help, too.
WILLOW	I really think I'm fine with the handling.
KENNEDY	By yourself? Why?
WILLOW	Well, see above re; I'm the one who killed him.
KENNEDY	Given. How about if I just tag along anyway? Keep you company.
KENNEDY	You know where you're going?
WILLOW	To find some old friends of mine. Been awhile, but maybe they can help.
ANDREW	Okay, are things always that wackadoo around here?
ANYA	Ha! Newbie.
XANDER	I don't know what things are like in Houses of Evil, my young friend, but around here, that was kind of nothing.
ANDREW	Really? 'Cause it seemed like a lot was happening all at once. You guys aren't wicked exhausted?
DAWN	You sat around and watched bad things happen to other people. That's exhausting?
ANDREW	I'm very sensitive to the emotional pain of others, I found it draining.
ANYA	I thought you were exhausted --
ANDREW	I'm supposed to get a call when the new League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comes in. I gave them this number.
XANDER	Oh, see if you can get two -- Loser.
ANDREW	Summers' residence, this is Andrew speaking, how can I help you?
ANYA	Xander.
XANDER	Robson blacked out. Last thing he remembers, Giles' head was about to get real familiar with the Bringer's very sharp axe.
DAWN	Oh my god.
ANYA	Giles never mentioned any of this.
XANDER	Robson said that by the time he came to, no Giles.
DAWN	So what are we saying...
XANDER	Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.
ANYA	Or maybe he didn't make it.
XANDER	Because if you wanted to infiltrate the inner circle of the Slayer...
ANYA	You become the one person she trusts more than anyone else.
DAWN	But there's no way we can know...
ANDREW	Actually, that's not true.
ANYA	Well, it's not like Giles hasn't touched anything... right?
ANDREW	Where are you --
XANDER	Desert. We're gonna find Giles.
ANDREW	Oh, good, lemme just get some tapes for the car, I've been working on this mix --
XANDER	You're not coming.
ANDREW	What? Why? 'Cause I used to be evil?
XANDER	Well, actually, no, 'cause you're annoying, but, yeah, that's a good reason, too.
ANDREW	Wait, don't leave me here all alone, I keep getting attacked in this house.
DAWN	Actually, Xand...
ANDREW	What if this is all part of the plan, drive you away so it can have its way with me, ever think of that?
XANDER	I'll risk it.
ANDREW	Okay, well, if you leave me here alone, I'll do something evil. Like... burning something. Or gluing things together.
ANYA	For crying out loud, Harris, just take him. Least we can keep an eye on him.
XANDER	I know. They're out there alone with him. All of them.
VAUGHNE	Um, hi, we're...
WILLOW	Oh. Hey. I'm sorry. Willow. We actually met when I was a freshman. And, also, not a boy. This is Kennedy.
KENNEDY	Hey.
VAUGHNE	You're Willow?
WILLOW	Yeah.
VAUGHNE	No, we still do those, too, second Tuesday of every month, I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time with the whole guy of it --
VAUGHNE	But she's doing so much better. Amy...
AMY	Vaughne, it's okay, I wanna do this. (to Willow) It took me a while to really see myself. But I did.
AMY	Yeah, the thing is, we're mostly about healing spirits and nurturing our life force here.
WILLOW	Oh.
AMY	But we'll try.
SPIKE	Guess here we are.
BUFFY	Yup. Here are we.
SPIKE	You sure you still wanna go back in this place with me?
BUFFY	Eh. Nothing good on TV tonight.
SPIKE	Dunno. Worked pretty good when I was living in residence here. Any time I got a little... rambunctious, the chip would kick in, I'd feel like my head was gonna explode, they'd dope me up, and everything would be all daffodils and teddy bears. For a couple hours, anyway.
BUFFY	I'm... maybe we should look around for files and stuff, too. We can learn about the chip, its shelf life.
SPIKE	I'll take whatever we can get.
AMY	...her spirit true, its shell a lie, we draw upon your very might... KENNEDY (to Vaughne/re: Amy) What if she can't handle this?
VAUGHNE	You've got a better idea?
AMY	You... you slapped me.
WILLOW	No. I, I didn't. It wasn't me.
WILLOW	Upset? Upset ?!? Are you just tuning in, did you not see that? I'm turning into him. It's not a trick, it's not a glamour, I'm becoming him. A murderous, misogynist man . Do you understand what he did? What I could do? I killed him for a reason .
KENNEDY	Getting angry isn't helping. We can still try to-
WILLOW	You understand nothing about magic. And in case you didn't notice, our "date" is over.
BUFFY	Oh god.
SPIKE	Yeah. You never really get used to that smell, do you?
BUFFY	Guess not.
SPIKE	Buffy.
BUFFY	Casualties in Adam's final battle here.
SPIKE	They just sealed the place off. Left everything as it was.
BUFFY	I'm thinking brief stay.
SPIKE	Yeah, you're not wrong.
ANYA	How long since they left?
XANDER	Few hours.
ANYA	If it's The First -- and I'm not saying it is, but... What are we expecting to find?
DAWN	You've got a group of Slayers-in- training stranded out in the middle of the desert...
XANDER	You didn't bring 'em out there to meditate.
ANDREW	Kinda makes you grateful you're not a Potential after all, doesn't it. Safer.
ANYA	Yeah, well, not so fast with the big whew.
XANDER	He might know we're coming.
ANYA	Which means we're already too late, we're heading out to the middle of nowhere --
DAWN	With no Slayer, no powerful witch...
ANYA	Just a teenager, a powerless former demon and two big geeks.
SPIKE	You hear that?
BUFFY	Yup.
SPIKE	Think something survived?
BUFFY	Looks like.
SPIKE	You see where?
BUFFY	No. Sounded like it was over there...
KENNEDY	Where'd they go?
AMY	Took off. That was a little too creepy. Even for us.
KENNEDY	I never said I was a Potential Slayer.
AMY	Oh. No, I think you did, when you guys first showed up, you told us --
KENNEDY	No. I didn't.
AMY	Oops.
GILES	Gah!
XANDER	Touch him!
DAWN	I feel him! I feel him!
XANDER	Me too.
ANDREW	Me too!
GILES	Yes. Good. We all feel each other. (pointed/to Andrew) Including those of us who don't really know each other well enough to take such liberties.
ANYA	We thought you might be non-corporeal evil.
DAWN	We got a call. We couldn't remember you touching anything.
XANDER	We had to come make sure you were okay. We were worried.
SPIKE	What's happening...?
GENERAL	Ms. Summers. Agent Finn reported that you tried to contact him earlier today.
BUFFY	Ha! Government conspiracy, I knew it!
GENERAL	Med team tells me they took a look at the chip, ma'am. You were right, it's degraded. Leave it as it is much longer, it'll be fatal to him.
BUFFY	Okay. How long until --
GENERAL	Now, ma'am.
BUFFY	Right. Of course What do we do next?
GENERAL	Agent Finn said it was your call, ma'am.
BUFFY	My... what was my call?
GENERAL	All decisions regarding Hostile Seventeen are to be left in your hands.
KENNEDY	What did you do to her?
AMY	What, to Willow? Oh. Just your standard Penance Malediction is all.
KENNEDY	Penance? For what, kissing me?
AMY	Wait, seriously? It happened when she... (laughing to herself) Nah, I planted the spell months ago after that whole "end of the world" routine... All I had to do was wait for her to punish herself. -- The spell just took her thoughts and powers and made them manifest. Turned out much better than I thought it would. That kiss musta been a whopper. Nice going, you must be good.
KENNEDY	All right, listen. You've had your fun. Now undo it. Let her out.
AMY	Okay. Oh, wait, I forgot. No.
KENNEDY	Why would you do this to her? You really hate her that much?
AMY	This isn't about hate. It's about power.
KENNEDY	Fun? She's disappearing, fading away in that... creep, and you think it's fun?
AMY	It was just a game. It's not my fault she's losing herself.
KENNEDY	I'm gonna stop you now, you know.
AMY	Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. I wonder where he'd be right about now?
WILLOW	You think you can just do that to me? That I'd let you get away with it?
KENNEDY	Do... get away with what?
WILLOW	It's too late, this is what I am. I made it happen, I'll make it stop.
KENNEDY	Willow, what did you make happen?
KENNEDY	You mean him.
WILLOW	Him! Her! You know what I mean...
KENNEDY	But you said her.
WILLOW	No. That was Warren --
KENNEDY	No. No, it wasn't, you said I was there. Who did you kill, Willow?
WILLOW	It was your fault. Slut. You tricked me, got me to forget.
KENNEDY	Tara...
WILLOW	Shut up! Shut! Up! You do not get to say her name! Offering it up to whoever's there. Tricking me into kissing you...
KENNEDY	Kissing me didn't mean -
WILLOW	No, she was never gone, she was with me, we should have been forever... and I... I let her be dead. She's really dead.
KENNEDY	Willow, no.
WILLOW	Oh, baby, I'm so sorry... don't leave me again, baby, come back, I'm sorry, come back.
KENNEDY	Willow.
KENNEDY	You all right?
KENNEDY	Yeah I'll make you some tea.

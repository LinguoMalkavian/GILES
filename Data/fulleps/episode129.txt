BUFFY	Here we go.
ANDREW	You keep circling around -- just drive straight in.
JONATHAN	Will you shut up? We gotta keep it low-pro.
ANDREW	Our pro couldn't be any more low. I'm not even sure this is a road .
JONATHAN	The freeway is a nesting symbol for John Q. Law.
ANDREW	That heat's passed, man.
JONATHAN	I'm laying odds our mugs are splashed across every wire from here to Appalachia and you want to drive on the freeway ? That's just what they want us to do .
ANDREW	You're just scared...
JONATHAN	Of course I'm scared! The last time we were here thirty-three-point-three- barred percent out us got flayed alive. And now we're driving right back into the belly of the beast.
ANDREW	Calm down -- no one's gonna get flayed alive. We've got a plan. We're gonna fix all that.
JONATHAN	We should have stayed in Mexico.
ANDREW	Oh, I didn't like it there. Everyone spoke Mexico-an.
JONATHAN	You could have learned it. You learned the entire Klingon dictionary in two and a half weeks.
ANDREW	That had a much clearer transitive and intransitive rules. And besides... I can't keep having those nightmares.
JONATHAN	Right. Me neither. "Desde abajo te devora."
ANDREW	"It eats you, starting with your bottom."
JONATHAN	We're gonna make it right...
ANDREW	We're outlaws. With hearts of gold.
DAWN	Anchovies, anchovies, you're so delicious / I love you more than all other fishes...
DAWN	She'll think it's blood.
DAWN	Hello?
DAWN	Cool.
DAWN	Are you seeing this, Kit? She is so dead, even just talking to this guy. Oh, he's clearly a psychopath... is so... what? That is not Tom Hanks. What are you talking about? Well what channel are you on?
HOLDEN	Buffy?
BUFFY	Uh, have we...
HOLDEN	Webs! Holden Webster! We were in school together! European History... I let you crib off my Vaclev Haval essay that time... You really don't remember me?
BUFFY	Oh, sure, sure...
DAWN	Oh god, oh god...
DAWN	Mom?
HOLDEN	Okay. Junior year, spring production of "Pippen"... I did the lighting design...
BUFFY	Didn't see it.
HOLDEN	But you helped me move the lighting board and I dropped it on your foot...
BUFFY	Foot! Yes! Right. And history class, okay, it's coming back. I'm sorry.
HOLDEN	Well, it's not like I was a huge part of your life-
BUFFY	But I just didn't recognize you 'cause you're, you know, a demon, and I think you've filled out a lot.
HOLDEN	Yeah, I got into tai kwon do in a big way at Dartmouth.
BUFFY	Well, that's great. So what have you been up to?
HOLDEN	Well, apparently, dying!
HOLDEN	No, but, other stuff, too... Majoring in psych, really loving that... And I was taking a year off to do an internship at the Sunnydale Mental Hospital.
BUFFY	Wow, that's gotta be a... popular joint.
HOLDEN	Yeah, I keep telling them we should get a bouncer and a velvet rope. Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler? Crazy Jay?
BUFFY	Oh, yeah...
HOLDEN	He had that shtick, all "I'm crazy! I'm crazy!"
BUFFY	How is he?
HOLDEN	Crazy. He's been in the chronic ward since graduation.
HOLDEN	Not really that funny, I guess.
BUFFY	Ironic, sort of.
HOLDEN	Yeah... Whoah! Did my face just change?
BUFFY	Yeah. You look human now. You can go back and forth.
HOLDEN	So I'm a vampire? How weird is that?
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
HOLDEN	No, it feels okay. Strong, and I feel like I'm connected to a powerful all-consuming evil that's gonna suck the world into fiery oblivion. What about you?
BUFFY	Not so much connected.
HOLDEN	No, no, but out here, the stake and the cross - you do this a lot?
BUFFY	Well, I'm the Slayer, it's sort of a thing...
HOLDEN	And you do what, fight vampires? Professionally?
BUFFY	Well, I don't get paid, it's more like a calling. Since... Even in school.
HOLDEN	I heard a lotta rumors about you back then. You were all mysterious...
BUFFY	I was?
HOLDEN	Well you were never around. Lotta kids thought you were dating some really old guy, or, like heavy religious. Scott Hope said you were gay.
BUFFY	What?! I dated that ringworm!
HOLDEN	He said that about every girl he broke up with. And then last year, big surprise, he comes out...
BUFFY	Men , do I know how to pick 'em.
HOLDEN	So all that time, you were a Slayer.
BUFFY	"The."
HOLDEN	"The." Like, the only?
BUFFY	Pretty much.
HOLDEN	So when you said, "not connected," that was kind of a telling statement.
BUFFY	Oh, psych 101 alert...
HOLDEN	I'm just saying-
BUFFY	Yeah, what I really need right now is emotional therapy from the Evil Dead.
HOLDEN	Hey, it was your phrase...
BUFFY	I'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, okay?
HOLDEN	No, no, I hear you.
BUFFY	I mean I really am...
DAWN	Buffy, come on... pick up... I don't know what to do...
JONATHAN	Oh, get up you wuss.
ANDREW	I have shin splints.
JONATHAN	Wow. They really rebuilt it.
ANDREW	It still smells new. I think.
JONATHAN	It's weird -- it's a different building and all... I mean, on one hand it's totally different... but it sorta feels exactly the same...
ANDREW	And so big. And empty.
JONATHAN	Maybe we could turn a light on or something.
ANDREW	They'll see it from the outside.
JONATHAN	Right...
ANDREW	No way.
JONATHAN	We'll just tell her what we know about the Seal of Danzalthar --
ANDREW	Think McFly! Why would she believe us without any proof? We go to her empty handed and we're cooling our heels in the clink inside a Bell's microsecond.
JONATHAN	I ain't going back to the big house. That place changes a man.
ANDREW	That's why we need proof. Think of it as a trial by fire -- a quest.
JONATHAN	Una questa .
ANDREW	We find it, we alert the Slayer, we help her destroy it, we save Sunnydale. Then we join her gang and possibly hang out at her house.
JONATHAN	Right. Okay. What do we do?
ANDREW	I think we should find the principal's office and work our way down from there.
JONATHAN	You look down that hallway, I'll go check over there.
ANDREW	Check communications.
JONATHAN	Check. Check.
ANDREW	Check. Check.
JONATHAN	Check. Check. Check check check. Check. ANDREW Check check. Check check. Check. Check.
JONATHAN	Check.
ANDREW	This is Echo One. Go ahead.
JONATHAN	Do you really think they'll let us join their gang?
WARREN	Nice job.
ANDREW	Where have you been?
WARREN	Take it easy, take it easy...
ANDREW	I'm scared out of my friggin' gourd here. Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?
WARREN	Calm down, you're doing great. All specs are within parameters.
ANDREW	I hate it when you leave me. One time you left me and I ended up a Mexican.
WARREN	We've been over this -- that death thing was all part of the Master Plan.
ANDREW	I know. But sometimes I don't understand the Master Plan...
WARREN	You of all people should understand the Master Plan. C'mon -- "If you strike me down..."
ANDREW	" ...I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine." Of course! Do you think maybe Willow could kill me too?
WARREN	Hey, don't worry. Short Round holds up his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.
ANDREW	"That boy is our last hope."
WARREN	"No. There is another."
ANDREW	Wait. Really? Who's our other hope?
WARREN	No -- I was just going with it. It was a thing. He's our last hope.
TARA	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey?
TARA	I'm sorry to wake you.
WILLOW	Ha...
TARA	Ha - what?
WILLOW	Is that like a dream joke thing? You're sorry to wake me, but I'm clearly not awake and if I was awake and you really were here, would you be sorry to wake me up? I mean, after all this time and - Oh God, I'm babbling. I'm dream babbling and it's the best dream of my life and I'm wasting it and-
TARA	I just meant, I liked watching you sleep.
WILLOW	Oh.
TARA	Shhhh, baby-
WILLOW	Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to-
TARA	It's okay. I want you to. But I don't think I can. Touch.
WILLOW	Wait! Don't! Don't leave-
TARA	I'm not. I was just - my skirt was bunching up.
WILLOW	Oh. So we'll just sit. We'll sit here. And if the dream, or possibly ghosty, rules are no touching, that's fine. Just don't go. Okay?
TARA	Willow-
WILLOW	I think I'm kind of hyperventilating.
TARA	Will-
WILLOW	No, it's okay. Just...
TARA	Sweetie-
WILLOW	It hurts so much. I miss you so much.
TARA	I know. I know-
WILLOW	I keep telling myself, better to have loved, right? And lost? Like, at least we had that. But sometimes I wish...
TARA	It's okay-
WILLOW	It's not okay! It's so much worse now. Like, you filled my life up. You made it bigger. And when you... The hole you left is so deep. I'm never going to fill it up. I'm never going to...
TARA	You can. You will.
WILLOW	How? You're gone.
TARA	But you're not. And you're strong. Like an Amazon, remember?
WILLOW	Big snotty weepy Amazon.
TARA	Gotta start somewhere.
BUFFY	But they never last.
HOLDEN	You mean all relationships, or just yours?
BUFFY	Well, my folks weren't paragons of stay-togetherness, and maybe that's a part of... but I think there's people out there who make it. I just seem to target the impossible ones. With deadly accuracy.
HOLDEN	You think you do that on purpose? Are you maybe protecting yourself?
BUFFY	Protecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual violence and possible death, not so much.
HOLDEN	From committing.
BUFFY	I commit! I'm committed! I'm a committee .
HOLDEN	So it's them. You're reaching out, they're not coming through.
BUFFY	No... I mean, it's different... You're confusing me 'cause you're evil.
HOLDEN	I just think you're in some pain here. Which I kind of do enjoy 'cause I'm evil now, but I think you should ease up on yourself. You don't exactly have the patent on bad relationships.
BUFFY	Wouldn't it be cool if I did, though?
HOLDEN	And what, you're supposed to be settling down already? At twenty? My girlfriend at college is so sweet - we have a great thing. Doesn't mean I wanna go vampify her so we can be together forever.
BUFFY	Sire.
HOLDEN	What?
BUFFY	The word. When you turn a human into a vampire. It's, you "sire" them.
HOLDEN	Cool.
BUFFY	It's a noun too.
HOLDEN	There's a lot of stuff I'm gonna have to learn here. Come on, how insane is this? I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. Wouldn't it be sweet if we became nemeses?
BUFFY	Is that how you say the word?
HOLDEN	We're gonna fight to the death here, aren't we?
BUFFY	That's the time-honored custom.
HOLDEN	Wow. Reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? But you know, I got the bloodlust pumpin', I kinda get it. I'm looking for a fight. And it's nothing personal...
BUFFY	No, no, you've been great.
HOLDEN	And fun catching up. You know, I really didn't keep in contact with that many of my friends from high school. (evil smile) Guess I'll be looking up them pretty soon!
BUFFY	Yeah.
HOLDEN	Okay, I'm really being Count Butt-in- sky here, but you seem not as thrilled. Is it 'cause we're gonna fight?
BUFFY	It's 'cause I'm gonna win.
HOLDEN	Uh, hello, two years of tai kwan do plus vampire strength, I think someone's counting their chickens...
BUFFY	You're not leaving this graveyard. I can't let you.
HOLDEN	Do the words 'superiority complex' mean anything to you?
BUFFY	What, you think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You know I'm sworn to -
HOLDEN	No no, I get the battle against evil, that's not the issue.
BUFFY	There's no issue. Don't issue me.
HOLDEN	Let me ask you this. Who's fault was your parents' divorce?
BUFFY	Okay, this is beyond evil. This is insane troll logic. What do my parents --
HOLDEN	I'm just curious. Your opinion.
BUFFY	Well, they couldn't get along, they both had a lot of...
HOLDEN	Top of your head.
BUFFY	My dad.
HOLDEN	Uh huh.
BUFFY	He cheated. I'm pretty sure he cheated. I mean, Mom never said anything, and, God, Dawn has no idea, but I think he was...
HOLDEN	And you never told anyone. None of your friends.
BUFFY	No point. It was over.
HOLDEN	So. All those relationships of yours that you knew, subconsciously, were totally doomed. Whose fault was that?
BUFFY	It's incredibly different!
HOLDEN	I'm just wondering. Is it possible that just a little bit, you can't connect with guys because you think they're not worth it? Maybe you think you're better than them?
BUFFY	Say! There's that bloodlust I was looking for!
HOLDEN	Struck a nerve...
BUFFY	I'm gonna strike a nerve CLUSTER in a minute, you don't get off this. You know, I really don't remember you being this annoying.
HOLDEN	You don't remember me at all.
BUFFY	Yes I do...
HOLDEN	Yeah, after, like, thirty minutes of reminding. And I really don't take it personally, 'cause you clearly were in your own world in high school, all Chosen, all Destiny.... who could live like that for seven years and NOT feel superior?
BUFFY	I'm not. God, if anything...
HOLDEN	What?
BUFFY	I'm really... if you knew what I've done, what I've let myself become...
HOLDEN	I'm here to kill you, Buffy, not to judge you.
BUFFY	The relationships, I know it's not their fault. I'm not really sure how they put up with me. The last guy I was with, it got really... I behaved like a monster. Treated him like... and at the same time I let him just take me over, do things to me that... if anyone knew what really went on between us, they'd never look at me again.
HOLDEN	I think they would.
BUFFY	You don't know.
HOLDEN	And you don't either... 'til you tell someone.
BUFFY	I couldn't...
HOLDEN	There's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY	You son of a bitch.
HOLDEN	What?
BUFFY	I think I'm gonna kill you just a little bit more than usual.
HOLDEN	Hey, we had a moment, you opened up, it was sweet and it made me wanna bite you. I'm sorry if I overstepped bounds... I'm new at this mortal enemy stuff.
DAWN	I hear you. The thing that's breathing? I hear you breathing.
DAWN	Are you hurting my mother? Are you keeping her from coming back to me?
DAWN	Mom. I... I see you. I'm coming toward you, okay?
ANDREW	You know, you could help me here. Orienteering is best suited for two adults -- one to calibrate the compass, the other to survey the --
JONATHAN	This basement's enormous. Is the high school this big?
ANDREW	I hate it down here. It's all dank and barren.
JONATHAN	Awww -- like Empress Josephine.
ANDREW	This doesn't make any sense... Where did you go...
JONATHAN	Dude, I'm right here. Pull yourself toget --
ANDREW	What was that?
JONATHAN	I don't know --
ANDREW	Maybe we should go upstairs. For a little bit.
JONATHAN	Yeah...
ANDREW	Or maybe you're right. Maybe we should go get Buffy...
JONATHAN	Yeah...
ANDREW	She could... help us...
JONATHAN	No. Esto es la questa . La questa... para redempcion .
JONATHAN	I wonder what the new cafeteria is like?
ANDREW	Why do you care? These walls aren't supposed to be here. This is wrong...
JONATHAN	I don't know. Seeing the high school again... part of me wishes I could go back.
ANDREW	Everything's shifting around. I feel like we're in Hellraiser . I hate Pinhead.
JONATHAN	Let me see that.
ANDREW	There it is...
JONATHAN	What? Are you sure?
ANDREW	Yeah.
JONATHAN	You know, I think you may be right.
BUFFY	See? You're dead? That enough of a moment for you?
HOLDEN	Okay, but are you killing me because I'm evil, or because you opened up?
BUFFY	GNAARRRRGH!!!!
HOLDEN	Nothing. I got no worries; I'm dead. Biggest thing on my mind is whether Julie Waldman came to my funeral or not. You remember her? OH bite-able.
BUFFY	See, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death and pain and love, it's all, the same damn thing to you.
HOLDEN	Well, in a way, that's a guy thing; you know, we talk about 'nailing' a girl, there's a lot of sub --
BUFFY	It's not the same. With vampires, it's completely... believe me, I know.
HOLDEN	Oh my god.
BUFFY	Oh your god what?
HOLDEN	Well, not MY god, 'cause I defy him and all his works -- does he exist, by the way? Is there word on that?
BUFFY	Nothing solid.
HOLDEN	I'm getting off topic 'cause my mind's racing here, but I'll make you a deal. We fight. To the death, great -- that last fight was just exhilarating and I actually had a move coming up to block the stake, but you have to answer one question. If I'm right; then I'm allowed to ask anything. No secrets, no defensiveness, you tell me anything I wanna know. And we call a truce 'til I'm satisfied. After that, good old-fashioned gentlemen's duel. No sudden attacks. If you tell me the truth.
BUFFY	What's your question?
HOLDEN	Your last relationship. Was it with a vampire?
WILLOW	I don't know... I don't know where to start. (with difficulty) Tara. After Warren shot you. I had a very... dramatic reaction. I killed him. I mean, really, really killed him. And then...
TARA	I know. And I know what you tried to do.
WILLOW	You do? There's gossip where you are?
TARA	It's not like that. I just know.
WILLOW	It was horrible. I was horrible. I lost myself. The regular me.
TARA	You were grieving-
WILLOW	A lot of people grieve. They don't make with the flaying. I hurt so many people. All my friends. Buffy, Xander, Giles... I didn't care. I wanted to erase them all. I wanted to erase the whole world.
TARA	It wasn't you. It was the power.
WILLOW	But I am the power. It's in me. Did I mention random destruction of property? The magic box is... not so much a box now-
TARA	The power is bigger than you, that's what I always tried to tell you.
WILLOW	I know. You were right-
TARA	You just have to stop. You can't use magic again. Not ever.
WILLOW	Black magic. Of course. But Giles says it isn't as simple as quitting it all cold turkey. He says I have to learn to use my power for good. The magic is in me now, and if I try to repress it, it's going to end up coming out again - in a bad way.
TARA	It's too dangerous. You can't take the chance that you'll lose control.
WILLOW	I don't want to. I can't. But the stuff Giles and the coven taught me in England - it helped. And, you know, all I have to do is think of the look on Dawnie's face - when I tried to... When I said such awful things to her. I never want to see that look again. I never want to cause that kind of pain.
TARA	I know you don't.
WILLOW	So I won't. I'm going to be okay.
TARA	Oh, baby. You're not listening. Don't you understand? You're not going to be okay. You're going to kill everybody.
DAWN	I hear you, filth. I know you're there. Demon filth. I will cast you out. My mother needs to talk to me.
BUFFY	I'm afraid. I'm afraid of falling back into the way I was last year. I thought I was nothing. I have so much power, I didn't ask for it, I don't deserve it... sometimes I think... I think the relationship I had last year was... like I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I deserved to.
BUFFY	And the joke is, he loved me. In his own sick, soulless way, he really did care for me. But I didn't want to be loved.
BUFFY	I just wanted to be touched. To be reached. Were you here when everything turned into a musical?
BUFFY	I explained it a lot better then. With rhyme, and all, but I just... I can't go back to that.
BUFFY	Well, he's changed, a lot, a LOT a lot, but no, I... I just can't feel as low as I did then and do what I have to do. Things are getting worse. More of you guys are rising, and... something's coming.
BUFFY	I have to fight it and the truth is, I don't have any more answers than I did then. There's so many people to protect...
BUFFY	I have friends, they do it with me -- sometimes they do it in spite of me, but they do it 'cause they're decent people. I do it 'cause I was chosen.
BUFFY	I feel like I'm worse than anyone, honestly, I'm beneath them. My friends, my boyfriends, I feel like I'm not worthy of their love 'cause even though they love me it doesn't really mean anything because their opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've been through, they're not the Slayer... I am. And sometimes I feel... this is what's so awful. I feel like I'm better than them. Superior.
BUFFY	It doesn't make any sense.
BUFFY	I suppose. Thanks for listening.
BUFFY	You're not a stranger. But that stuff with Spike is pretty --
BUFFY	What?
JONATHAN	"You said the headpiece only had markings on one side. Are you absolutely sure?"
JONATHAN	"They're digging in the wrong place!" ANDREW "They're digging in the wrong place!"
JONATHAN	We've almost got this thing uncovered.
ANDREW	Yep.
JONATHAN	I hope Buffy'll have some idea of how to destroy -- Thirty-six, nineteen, twenty-seven! That's it! That was my locker combination. That's been bugging me all night...
ANDREW	Dude, we've spent the last few years trying to forget high school. Why are you trying so hard to remember it?
JONATHAN	I don't know... I guess I miss it. Don't you?
ANDREW	Yeah, I really miss it. You know, I don't think they even knew my name back then.
JONATHAN	I'm serious. I really miss it. Time goes by -- everything drops away. All the cruelty, all the pain, all the humiliation. It all washes away.
ANDREW	Yeah? Well, you know what? They don't want to talk to you. All those people you just mentioned -- not one of them's sitting around going, "I wonder what Jonathan's up to right now?" Not one of them cares about you.
JONATHAN	Well I still care about them. That's why I'm here.
DAWN	I cast you out with every prayer from every god that walks the earth or crawls beneath.
JOYCE	Things are coming, Dawn. Listen. Things are on their way. I love you. And I love Buffy. But she will not be there for you.
DAWN	What? What are you--
JOYCE	There will be choosing to be done. And when it is very bad, Buffy will not choose you. She will be against you.
DAWN	No! Don't go! God! Don't go !
WILLOW	I'm going to... what?
TARA	It's why I came. I needed to warn you.
WILLOW	How do you know? What do you know?
TARA	You don't want to know what I saw.
WILLOW	Oh God...
TARA	But if you stop. Completely. No more magic-
WILLOW	Right. Right. Stop. But what about Giles? He made it seem like it would be just as dangerous for me to quit completely. Like I'll go off the deep end again.
TARA	You can't. Willow, if you do so much as another spell...
WILLOW	I tried to stop. I tried. What if I can't do this?
TARA	Don't think that way-
WILLOW	How can I not ? You're telling me I'm going to murder all my friends! I'm not strong, Tara. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me. Look what I did before...
TARA	There is one thing. One thing you could do to stop it.
WILLOW	What? Anything.
TARA	You could sleep.
WILLOW	Who are you?
BUFFY	What do you mean? You know Spike? How?
BUFFY	Sired.
WILLOW	Tell me who you are.
WILLOW	Stop-
WILLOW	Stop. Stop using Tara this way-
WILLOW	From beneath you it devours.
ANDREW	You keep circling around -- just drive straight in.
JONATHAN	Will you shut up? We gotta keep it low-pro.
ANDREW	Our pro couldn't be any more low. I'm not even sure this is a road .
JONATHAN	The freeway is a nesting symbol for John Q. Law.
ANDREW	That heat's passed, man.
JONATHAN	I'm laying odds our mugs are splashed across every wire from here to Appalachia and you want to drive on the freeway ? That's just what they want us to do .
ANDREW	You're just scared...
JONATHAN	Of course I'm scared! The last time we were here thirty-three-point-three- barred percent out us got flayed alive. And now we're driving right back into the belly of the beast.
ANDREW	Calm down -- no one's gonna get flayed alive. We've got a plan. We're gonna fix all that.
JONATHAN	We should have stayed in Mexico.
ANDREW	Oh, I didn't like it there. Everyone spoke Mexico-an.
JONATHAN	You could have learned it. You learned the entire Klingon dictionary in two and a half weeks.
ANDREW	That had a much clearer transitive and intransitive rules. And besides... I can't keep having those nightmares.
JONATHAN	Right. Me neither. "Desde abajo te devora."
ANDREW	"It eats you, starting with your bottom."
JONATHAN	We're gonna make it right...
ANDREW	We're outlaws. With hearts of gold.
BUFFY	Uh, have we...
HOLDEN	Webs! Holden Webster! We were in school together! European History... I let you crib off my Vaclev Haval essay that time... You really don't remember me?
BUFFY	Oh, sure, sure...
HOLDEN	Okay. Junior year, spring production of "Pippen"... I did the lighting design...
BUFFY	Didn't see it.
HOLDEN	But you helped me move the lighting board and I dropped it on your foot...
BUFFY	Foot! Yes! Right. And history class, okay, it's coming back. I'm sorry.
HOLDEN	Well, it's not like I was a huge part of your life-
BUFFY	But I just didn't recognize you 'cause you're, you know, a demon, and I think you've filled out a lot.
HOLDEN	Yeah, I got into tai kwon do in a big way at Dartmouth.
BUFFY	Well, that's great. So what have you been up to?
HOLDEN	Well, apparently, dying!
HOLDEN	No, but, other stuff, too... Majoring in psych, really loving that... And I was taking a year off to do an internship at the Sunnydale Mental Hospital.
BUFFY	Wow, that's gotta be a... popular joint.
HOLDEN	Yeah, I keep telling them we should get a bouncer and a velvet rope. Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler? Crazy Jay?
BUFFY	Oh, yeah...
HOLDEN	He had that shtick, all "I'm crazy! I'm crazy!"
BUFFY	How is he?
HOLDEN	Crazy. He's been in the chronic ward since graduation.
HOLDEN	Not really that funny, I guess.
BUFFY	Ironic, sort of.
HOLDEN	Yeah... Whoah! Did my face just change?
BUFFY	Yeah. You look human now. You can go back and forth.
HOLDEN	So I'm a vampire? How weird is that?
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
HOLDEN	No, it feels okay. Strong, and I feel like I'm connected to a powerful all-consuming evil that's gonna suck the world into fiery oblivion. What about you?
BUFFY	Not so much connected.
HOLDEN	No, no, but out here, the stake and the cross - you do this a lot?
BUFFY	Well, I'm the Slayer, it's sort of a thing...
HOLDEN	And you do what, fight vampires? Professionally?
BUFFY	Well, I don't get paid, it's more like a calling. Since... Even in school.
HOLDEN	I heard a lotta rumors about you back then. You were all mysterious...
BUFFY	I was?
HOLDEN	Well you were never around. Lotta kids thought you were dating some really old guy, or, like heavy religious. Scott Hope said you were gay.
BUFFY	What?! I dated that ringworm!
HOLDEN	He said that about every girl he broke up with. And then last year, big surprise, he comes out...
BUFFY	Men , do I know how to pick 'em.
HOLDEN	So all that time, you were a Slayer.
BUFFY	"The."
HOLDEN	"The." Like, the only?
BUFFY	Pretty much.
HOLDEN	So when you said, "not connected," that was kind of a telling statement.
BUFFY	Oh, psych 101 alert...
HOLDEN	I'm just saying-
BUFFY	Yeah, what I really need right now is emotional therapy from the Evil Dead.
HOLDEN	Hey, it was your phrase...
BUFFY	I'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, okay?
HOLDEN	No, no, I hear you.
BUFFY	I mean I really am...
JONATHAN	Oh, get up you wuss.
ANDREW	I have shin splints.
JONATHAN	Wow. They really rebuilt it.
ANDREW	It still smells new. I think.
JONATHAN	It's weird -- it's a different building and all... I mean, on one hand it's totally different... but it sorta feels exactly the same...
ANDREW	And so big. And empty.
JONATHAN	Maybe we could turn a light on or something.
ANDREW	They'll see it from the outside.
JONATHAN	Right...
ANDREW	No way.
JONATHAN	We'll just tell her what we know about the Seal of Danzalthar --
ANDREW	Think McFly! Why would she believe us without any proof? We go to her empty handed and we're cooling our heels in the clink inside a Bell's microsecond.
JONATHAN	I ain't going back to the big house. That place changes a man.
ANDREW	That's why we need proof. Think of it as a trial by fire -- a quest.
JONATHAN	Una questa .
ANDREW	We find it, we alert the Slayer, we help her destroy it, we save Sunnydale. Then we join her gang and possibly hang out at her house.
JONATHAN	Right. Okay. What do we do?
ANDREW	I think we should find the principal's office and work our way down from there.
JONATHAN	You look down that hallway, I'll go check over there.
ANDREW	Check communications.
JONATHAN	Check. Check.
ANDREW	Check. Check.
JONATHAN	Check. Check. Check check check. Check. ANDREW Check check. Check check. Check. Check.
JONATHAN	Check.
ANDREW	This is Echo One. Go ahead.
JONATHAN	Do you really think they'll let us join their gang?
ANDREW	Where have you been?
WARREN	Take it easy, take it easy...
ANDREW	I'm scared out of my friggin' gourd here. Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?
WARREN	Calm down, you're doing great. All specs are within parameters.
ANDREW	I hate it when you leave me. One time you left me and I ended up a Mexican.
WARREN	We've been over this -- that death thing was all part of the Master Plan.
ANDREW	I know. But sometimes I don't understand the Master Plan...
WARREN	You of all people should understand the Master Plan. C'mon -- "If you strike me down..."
ANDREW	" ...I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine." Of course! Do you think maybe Willow could kill me too?
WARREN	Hey, don't worry. Short Round holds up his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.
ANDREW	"That boy is our last hope."
WARREN	"No. There is another."
ANDREW	Wait. Really? Who's our other hope?
WARREN	No -- I was just going with it. It was a thing. He's our last hope.
TARA	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey?
TARA	I'm sorry to wake you.
WILLOW	Ha...
TARA	Ha - what?
WILLOW	Is that like a dream joke thing? You're sorry to wake me, but I'm clearly not awake and if I was awake and you really were here, would you be sorry to wake me up? I mean, after all this time and - Oh God, I'm babbling. I'm dream babbling and it's the best dream of my life and I'm wasting it and-
TARA	I just meant, I liked watching you sleep.
WILLOW	Oh.
TARA	Shhhh, baby-
WILLOW	Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to-
TARA	It's okay. I want you to. But I don't think I can. Touch.
WILLOW	Wait! Don't! Don't leave-
TARA	I'm not. I was just - my skirt was bunching up.
WILLOW	Oh. So we'll just sit. We'll sit here. And if the dream, or possibly ghosty, rules are no touching, that's fine. Just don't go. Okay?
TARA	Willow-
WILLOW	I think I'm kind of hyperventilating.
TARA	Will-
WILLOW	No, it's okay. Just...
TARA	Sweetie-
WILLOW	It hurts so much. I miss you so much.
TARA	I know. I know-
WILLOW	I keep telling myself, better to have loved, right? And lost? Like, at least we had that. But sometimes I wish...
TARA	It's okay-
WILLOW	It's not okay! It's so much worse now. Like, you filled my life up. You made it bigger. And when you... The hole you left is so deep. I'm never going to fill it up. I'm never going to...
TARA	You can. You will.
WILLOW	How? You're gone.
TARA	But you're not. And you're strong. Like an Amazon, remember?
WILLOW	Big snotty weepy Amazon.
TARA	Gotta start somewhere.
BUFFY	But they never last.
HOLDEN	You mean all relationships, or just yours?
BUFFY	Well, my folks weren't paragons of stay-togetherness, and maybe that's a part of... but I think there's people out there who make it. I just seem to target the impossible ones. With deadly accuracy.
HOLDEN	You think you do that on purpose? Are you maybe protecting yourself?
BUFFY	Protecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual violence and possible death, not so much.
HOLDEN	From committing.
BUFFY	I commit! I'm committed! I'm a committee .
HOLDEN	So it's them. You're reaching out, they're not coming through.
BUFFY	No... I mean, it's different... You're confusing me 'cause you're evil.
HOLDEN	I just think you're in some pain here. Which I kind of do enjoy 'cause I'm evil now, but I think you should ease up on yourself. You don't exactly have the patent on bad relationships.
BUFFY	Wouldn't it be cool if I did, though?
HOLDEN	And what, you're supposed to be settling down already? At twenty? My girlfriend at college is so sweet - we have a great thing. Doesn't mean I wanna go vampify her so we can be together forever.
BUFFY	Sire.
HOLDEN	What?
BUFFY	The word. When you turn a human into a vampire. It's, you "sire" them.
HOLDEN	Cool.
BUFFY	It's a noun too.
HOLDEN	There's a lot of stuff I'm gonna have to learn here. Come on, how insane is this? I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. Wouldn't it be sweet if we became nemeses?
BUFFY	Is that how you say the word?
HOLDEN	We're gonna fight to the death here, aren't we?
BUFFY	That's the time-honored custom.
HOLDEN	Wow. Reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? But you know, I got the bloodlust pumpin', I kinda get it. I'm looking for a fight. And it's nothing personal...
BUFFY	No, no, you've been great.
HOLDEN	And fun catching up. You know, I really didn't keep in contact with that many of my friends from high school. (evil smile) Guess I'll be looking up them pretty soon!
BUFFY	Yeah.
HOLDEN	Okay, I'm really being Count Butt-in- sky here, but you seem not as thrilled. Is it 'cause we're gonna fight?
BUFFY	It's 'cause I'm gonna win.
HOLDEN	Uh, hello, two years of tai kwan do plus vampire strength, I think someone's counting their chickens...
BUFFY	You're not leaving this graveyard. I can't let you.
HOLDEN	Do the words 'superiority complex' mean anything to you?
BUFFY	What, you think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You know I'm sworn to -
HOLDEN	No no, I get the battle against evil, that's not the issue.
BUFFY	There's no issue. Don't issue me.
HOLDEN	Let me ask you this. Who's fault was your parents' divorce?
BUFFY	Okay, this is beyond evil. This is insane troll logic. What do my parents --
HOLDEN	I'm just curious. Your opinion.
BUFFY	Well, they couldn't get along, they both had a lot of...
HOLDEN	Top of your head.
BUFFY	My dad.
HOLDEN	Uh huh.
BUFFY	He cheated. I'm pretty sure he cheated. I mean, Mom never said anything, and, God, Dawn has no idea, but I think he was...
HOLDEN	And you never told anyone. None of your friends.
BUFFY	No point. It was over.
HOLDEN	So. All those relationships of yours that you knew, subconsciously, were totally doomed. Whose fault was that?
BUFFY	It's incredibly different!
HOLDEN	I'm just wondering. Is it possible that just a little bit, you can't connect with guys because you think they're not worth it? Maybe you think you're better than them?
BUFFY	Say! There's that bloodlust I was looking for!
HOLDEN	Struck a nerve...
BUFFY	I'm gonna strike a nerve CLUSTER in a minute, you don't get off this. You know, I really don't remember you being this annoying.
HOLDEN	You don't remember me at all.
BUFFY	Yes I do...
HOLDEN	Yeah, after, like, thirty minutes of reminding. And I really don't take it personally, 'cause you clearly were in your own world in high school, all Chosen, all Destiny.... who could live like that for seven years and NOT feel superior?
BUFFY	I'm not. God, if anything...
HOLDEN	What?
BUFFY	I'm really... if you knew what I've done, what I've let myself become...
HOLDEN	I'm here to kill you, Buffy, not to judge you.
BUFFY	The relationships, I know it's not their fault. I'm not really sure how they put up with me. The last guy I was with, it got really... I behaved like a monster. Treated him like... and at the same time I let him just take me over, do things to me that... if anyone knew what really went on between us, they'd never look at me again.
HOLDEN	I think they would.
BUFFY	You don't know.
HOLDEN	And you don't either... 'til you tell someone.
BUFFY	I couldn't...
HOLDEN	There's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY	You son of a bitch.
HOLDEN	What?
BUFFY	I think I'm gonna kill you just a little bit more than usual.
HOLDEN	Hey, we had a moment, you opened up, it was sweet and it made me wanna bite you. I'm sorry if I overstepped bounds... I'm new at this mortal enemy stuff.
ANDREW	You know, you could help me here. Orienteering is best suited for two adults -- one to calibrate the compass, the other to survey the --
JONATHAN	This basement's enormous. Is the high school this big?
ANDREW	I hate it down here. It's all dank and barren.
JONATHAN	Awww -- like Empress Josephine.
ANDREW	This doesn't make any sense... Where did you go...
JONATHAN	Dude, I'm right here. Pull yourself toget --
ANDREW	What was that?
JONATHAN	I don't know --
ANDREW	Maybe we should go upstairs. For a little bit.
JONATHAN	Yeah...
ANDREW	Or maybe you're right. Maybe we should go get Buffy...
JONATHAN	Yeah...
ANDREW	She could... help us...
JONATHAN	No. Esto es la questa . La questa... para redempcion .
JONATHAN	I wonder what the new cafeteria is like?
ANDREW	Why do you care? These walls aren't supposed to be here. This is wrong...
JONATHAN	I don't know. Seeing the high school again... part of me wishes I could go back.
ANDREW	Everything's shifting around. I feel like we're in Hellraiser . I hate Pinhead.
JONATHAN	Let me see that.
ANDREW	There it is...
JONATHAN	What? Are you sure?
ANDREW	Yeah.
JONATHAN	You know, I think you may be right.
BUFFY	See? You're dead? That enough of a moment for you?
HOLDEN	Okay, but are you killing me because I'm evil, or because you opened up?
BUFFY	GNAARRRRGH!!!!
HOLDEN	Nothing. I got no worries; I'm dead. Biggest thing on my mind is whether Julie Waldman came to my funeral or not. You remember her? OH bite-able.
BUFFY	See, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death and pain and love, it's all, the same damn thing to you.
HOLDEN	Well, in a way, that's a guy thing; you know, we talk about 'nailing' a girl, there's a lot of sub --
BUFFY	It's not the same. With vampires, it's completely... believe me, I know.
HOLDEN	Oh my god.
BUFFY	Oh your god what?
HOLDEN	Well, not MY god, 'cause I defy him and all his works -- does he exist, by the way? Is there word on that?
BUFFY	Nothing solid.
HOLDEN	I'm getting off topic 'cause my mind's racing here, but I'll make you a deal. We fight. To the death, great -- that last fight was just exhilarating and I actually had a move coming up to block the stake, but you have to answer one question. If I'm right; then I'm allowed to ask anything. No secrets, no defensiveness, you tell me anything I wanna know. And we call a truce 'til I'm satisfied. After that, good old-fashioned gentlemen's duel. No sudden attacks. If you tell me the truth.
BUFFY	What's your question?
HOLDEN	Your last relationship. Was it with a vampire?
WILLOW	I don't know... I don't know where to start. (with difficulty) Tara. After Warren shot you. I had a very... dramatic reaction. I killed him. I mean, really, really killed him. And then...
TARA	I know. And I know what you tried to do.
WILLOW	You do? There's gossip where you are?
TARA	It's not like that. I just know.
WILLOW	It was horrible. I was horrible. I lost myself. The regular me.
TARA	You were grieving-
WILLOW	A lot of people grieve. They don't make with the flaying. I hurt so many people. All my friends. Buffy, Xander, Giles... I didn't care. I wanted to erase them all. I wanted to erase the whole world.
TARA	It wasn't you. It was the power.
WILLOW	But I am the power. It's in me. Did I mention random destruction of property? The magic box is... not so much a box now-
TARA	The power is bigger than you, that's what I always tried to tell you.
WILLOW	I know. You were right-
TARA	You just have to stop. You can't use magic again. Not ever.
WILLOW	Black magic. Of course. But Giles says it isn't as simple as quitting it all cold turkey. He says I have to learn to use my power for good. The magic is in me now, and if I try to repress it, it's going to end up coming out again - in a bad way.
TARA	It's too dangerous. You can't take the chance that you'll lose control.
WILLOW	I don't want to. I can't. But the stuff Giles and the coven taught me in England - it helped. And, you know, all I have to do is think of the look on Dawnie's face - when I tried to... When I said such awful things to her. I never want to see that look again. I never want to cause that kind of pain.
TARA	I know you don't.
WILLOW	So I won't. I'm going to be okay.
TARA	Oh, baby. You're not listening. Don't you understand? You're not going to be okay. You're going to kill everybody.
BUFFY	I'm afraid. I'm afraid of falling back into the way I was last year. I thought I was nothing. I have so much power, I didn't ask for it, I don't deserve it... sometimes I think... I think the relationship I had last year was... like I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I deserved to.
BUFFY	And the joke is, he loved me. In his own sick, soulless way, he really did care for me. But I didn't want to be loved.
BUFFY	I just wanted to be touched. To be reached. Were you here when everything turned into a musical?
BUFFY	I explained it a lot better then. With rhyme, and all, but I just... I can't go back to that.
BUFFY	Well, he's changed, a lot, a LOT a lot, but no, I... I just can't feel as low as I did then and do what I have to do. Things are getting worse. More of you guys are rising, and... something's coming.
BUFFY	I have to fight it and the truth is, I don't have any more answers than I did then. There's so many people to protect...
BUFFY	I have friends, they do it with me -- sometimes they do it in spite of me, but they do it 'cause they're decent people. I do it 'cause I was chosen.
BUFFY	I feel like I'm worse than anyone, honestly, I'm beneath them. My friends, my boyfriends, I feel like I'm not worthy of their love 'cause even though they love me it doesn't really mean anything because their opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've been through, they're not the Slayer... I am. And sometimes I feel... this is what's so awful. I feel like I'm better than them. Superior.
BUFFY	It doesn't make any sense.
BUFFY	I suppose. Thanks for listening.
BUFFY	You're not a stranger. But that stuff with Spike is pretty --
BUFFY	What?
JONATHAN	"You said the headpiece only had markings on one side. Are you absolutely sure?"
JONATHAN	We've almost got this thing uncovered.
ANDREW	Yep.
JONATHAN	I hope Buffy'll have some idea of how to destroy -- Thirty-six, nineteen, twenty-seven! That's it! That was my locker combination. That's been bugging me all night...
ANDREW	Dude, we've spent the last few years trying to forget high school. Why are you trying so hard to remember it?
JONATHAN	I don't know... I guess I miss it. Don't you?
ANDREW	Yeah, I really miss it. You know, I don't think they even knew my name back then.
JONATHAN	I'm serious. I really miss it. Time goes by -- everything drops away. All the cruelty, all the pain, all the humiliation. It all washes away.
ANDREW	Yeah? Well, you know what? They don't want to talk to you. All those people you just mentioned -- not one of them's sitting around going, "I wonder what Jonathan's up to right now?" Not one of them cares about you.
JOYCE	Things are coming, Dawn. Listen. Things are on their way. I love you. And I love Buffy. But she will not be there for you.
DAWN	What? What are you--
JOYCE	There will be choosing to be done. And when it is very bad, Buffy will not choose you. She will be against you.
WILLOW	I'm going to... what?
TARA	It's why I came. I needed to warn you.
WILLOW	How do you know? What do you know?
TARA	You don't want to know what I saw.
WILLOW	Oh God...
TARA	But if you stop. Completely. No more magic-
WILLOW	Right. Right. Stop. But what about Giles? He made it seem like it would be just as dangerous for me to quit completely. Like I'll go off the deep end again.
TARA	You can't. Willow, if you do so much as another spell...
WILLOW	I tried to stop. I tried. What if I can't do this?
TARA	Don't think that way-
WILLOW	How can I not ? You're telling me I'm going to murder all my friends! I'm not strong, Tara. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me. Look what I did before...
TARA	There is one thing. One thing you could do to stop it.
WILLOW	What? Anything.
TARA	You could sleep.
WILLOW	Who are you?
BUFFY	What do you mean? You know Spike? How?
BUFFY	Sired.
WILLOW	Tell me who you are.
WILLOW	Stop-
WILLOW	Stop. Stop using Tara this way-
WILLOW	From beneath you it devours.

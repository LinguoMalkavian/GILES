DAWN	So the basement was filled with bodies?
WILLOW	Apparently.
DAWN	And Spike could have sired countless others and buried them around town?
WILLOW	It's not that simple.
ANYA	I think we should just stab him through the chest. Isn't that what we do when these things happen?
WILLOW	Buffy knows what she's doing.
ANYA	Xander, you know what we're talking about. You've always been in the "Spike is evil" faction.
XANDER	I have a house to put back together.
ANYA	Fine. You guys keep your heads in the sand. But I think we should all prepare ourselves for the possibility that William the Bloody is back.
WARREN	All right! Looking good. How do you feel?
ANDREW	Good.
WARREN	Excellent. We've got work to do.
ANDREW	Do we have to do work right now? Can't I just... walk around for a while? In my coat?
WARREN	Oh, don't go soft on me now. We're in the trench and the exhaust port's in sight.
ANDREW	I thought that was it. It's not my fault it didn't work. I did what you told me. Why do I have to do all the wet works?
WARREN	Hey, you know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. Here -- feel.
ANDREW	Cool.
WARREN	Yeah, it's pretty bitchin'. I'm like Obi-Wan.
ANDREW	Or Patrick Swayze...
WARREN	Believe me, I'd do this stuff if I could, but I can't. I need you. you're my iron fist.
ANDREW	I just don't think I can kill anybody else.
JONATHAN	Oh, will you stop worrying about that?
ANDREW	I didn't want to kill you. Warren made me.
JONATHAN	Hey, I'm glad he did. This is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
ANDREW	I hope it didn't hurt too much. I'm not very good at stabbing.
JONATHAN	You know, it wasn't that bad. It was like a sharp pain, then a burning, and then a general queasiness. It was kinda like when I used to get ulcers in high school, only at the end I became one with Light and Hope.
ANDREW	I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.
JONATHAN	Hey -- this isn't your fault, okay? (taps his chest) It's my fault. I screwed it up. I'm little. I don't have as much blood as other people. And I probably should have told somebody I was anemic. But don't worry, we're gonna fix it. You gotta trust us. We know what we're doing.
ANDREW	I can't kill anybody else...
JONATHAN	Okay, calm down. We can work around that.
BUFFY	We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
SPIKE	Don't...
WOOD	Now we can settle this one of two ways: You can help repaint the walls or I can suspend you and report the incident on your permanent record.
HOFFMAN	Fine. Do that.
GRIMES	We'll repaint it.
WOOD	Good.
DAWN	Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
DAWN	I just wanted to tell you that Buffy won't be coming in today. She's really sick.
WOOD	Oh no...
DAWN	Yeah, last night she was vomiting and then this morning she was vomiting some more and then just when we thought she was done she started vomiting again.
DAWN	Her exact words were, "I've got stuff coming out both ends."
WOOD	Thank you. That's very helpful.
DAWN	Sure, no problem. Hey, how's it going?
GRIMES	Pretty good.
WOOD	Tell your sister not to worry, we'll soldier on without her. She should just concentrate on getting better.
DAWN	Yeah, she'll be fine. She just needs to get some stuff out of her system.
BUFFY	I need to find him as soon as possible. He's not answering any of his numbers.
QUENTIN	Miss Summers, the Council does not keep track of our... lapsed employees. Ever since Mr. Giles pulled up his stake in Sunnydale, we've not made it our business to follow his every move.
BUFFY	You don't need to get all British and dodgy, Mr. Travers. I know you have ways of finding him.
QUENTIN	I suppose, if you feel the matter is urgent, we could look into it. BUFFY I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
QUENTIN	Of course. Good day.
BUFFY	Can I do anything?
SPIKE	You should probably --
BUFFY	Here --
BUFFY	He's been feasting on humans for weeks. I think he's in major withdrawal. We need to get him some blood.
WILLOW	Do you want me to kill Anya?
BUFFY	No... we should probably ween him off humans. He'll have to make do with animal blood.
WILLOW	I'll go get some.
BUFFY	You don't mind?
WILLOW	I need to get out of this house. Xander's putting in new windows and he keeps giving lectures on proper tool maintenance. Not exactly my area of expertise.
BUFFY	Thank you.
WILLOW	How's it going in there?
BUFFY	He's in bad shape. He's past the point where he can tell me anything.
WILLOW	I wasn't asking about him.
BUFFY	I'll be okay.
WARREN	Just do it fast.
ANDREW	What if she squeals?
WARREN	Better go for her throat first.
ANDREW	Babe 2: Pig in The City was really underrated.
WARREN	Don't think about Babe.
ANDREW	Right.
WARREN	You're Conan. You're the Destroyer.
ANDREW	THAT'LL DO, PIG!
WARREN	You gotta corner it...
BUTCHER	Number eighty-seven!
ANDREW	I'd like twelve pork chops, two pounds of sausage, Eightquartsofpigsblood, three steaks, um, a halibut... uh, some... toothpaste...
BUTCHER	This is a butcher shop, Neo. We don't sell toothpaste.
ANDREW	Oh. Okay. Just the other stuff, then.
BUTCHER	You got it.
BUTCHER	Number eighty-eight!
WILLOW	Hey! Wait!
WILLOW	Wait a minute!
ANDREW	Don't kill me!
WILLOW	I'm not gonna kill you...
ANDREW	Don't torture me and send me to an eternal pain dimension.
WILLOW	I'm not gonna --
ANDREW	Warren did it. I didn't do it. Warren shot her.
WILLOW	What are you doing here?
ANDREW	I'm not bad. I'm not bad anymore. I'm good. I do good things now. I'm here doing good things...
WILLOW	Then why do you need lots and lots of blood?
ANDREW	I am bad. I'm bad. I'm evil.
WILLOW	Shut your mouth.
WILLOW	Look what I found.
XANDER	Oh, this can't be good.
WILLOW	Guess who was buying massive amounts of blood at the butcher shop?
ANDREW	Your hair's not even black anymore...
XANDER	What are you doing back in town?
ANDREW	You'll get nothing out of me, carpenter.
XANDER	We'll see about that.
ANDREW	Careful with my coat. It's expensive.
ANYA	Is it new?
ANDREW	Hey --
XANDER	Now we can do this the hard way if you want --
ANDREW	Ow! Ow ow ow ow --
XANDER	But believe me when I tell you this'll be much easier on all of us if you just tell us what you know.
ANDREW	You're barking up the wrong asparagus, man. I don't know anything.
XANDER	Here's the thing -- I don't believe you.
ANDREW	I haven't done anything wrong.
XANDER	Then you won't mind if we ask you a few questions.
ANDREW	Yeah... okay.
XANDER	What were you doing buying blood at the butcher's shop?
ANDREW	I-fell-in-love-with-a-beautiful- vampire-girl-down-in-Mexico-and-now- we're-trying-to-make-a-go-of-it-on- the-straight-and-narrow-and-put-our- lives-back-together-here-in-Sunnydale.
ANYA	You think this is a game , junior!?!
ANDREW	Ahhhh --
XANDER	Hey --
ANYA	And you want to waste our time with deceptions ? Not on my watch!
XANDER	Hey! Anya .
ANYA	Did you see that? I actually made him cry.
XANDER	You were perfect. I was worried I overdid it with the whole easy way/hard way thing.
ANYA	No, that was great.
XANDER	He'll be singing in no time.
ANYA	What do we do now?
XANDER	Now we let him stew in his own juices for a bit, then we give him the hard brace.
ANYA	Right.
BUFFY	It's fine. He hasn't started talking yet.
ANYA	The weasel wants to sing. He just needs a tune.
XANDER	He's primed. He'll be ready to pump in no time.
BUFFY	Better?
SPIKE	I don't remember anything.
BUFFY	You were in pretty bad withdrawal.
SPIKE	No. Not that. I don't remember... what I did.
BUFFY	Oh. Nothing?
SPIKE	Flashes here and there. Like I'm watching someone else... do it. Kill people. I've been losing time for a while now. Waking up in strange places...
BUFFY	When did your chip stop working?
SPIKE	Wasn't aware that it had, you know. Not 'til now.
BUFFY	How about the losing time? How long's that been going on?
SPIKE	Things have been wonky for me ever since I got back. Ever since...
BUFFY	You got your soul.
SPIKE	Figured that's what it was like. Been so long since I had it.
BUFFY	How'd you do it? How'd you get it back?
SPIKE	"Saw a man about a girl."
BUFFY	Just like that.
SPIKE	No. Not like that. There was a price. There were trials... torture. Pain. Suffering. Of sorts...
BUFFY	Of sorts?
SPIKE	Well, s'all relative, innit?
BUFFY	Meaning?
SPIKE	Meaning I've come to redefine the words "pain" and "suffering" since I fell in love with you.
BUFFY	How can you say that?
SPIKE	Apparently I've just slaughtered half of Sunnydale, pet. Not really worried about being polite anymore.
BUFFY	You feeling sorry for yourself, Spike? That what this is about?
SPIKE	Feeling honest with myself. You used me.
BUFFY	Yes.
SPIKE	You told me that, of course. Never understood, though. Not 'til now. You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.
BUFFY	You figured this out just now?
SPIKE	Soul's not all about moonbeams and penny whistles, luv. It's about self-loathing I get it. Had to travel around the world, but I understand you now. I understand the violence inside.
BUFFY	Violence. William the Bloody now has insight into violence.
SPIKE	Not the same. Bad as I was, as evil and as wretched as I was, I never truly hated myself back then. Not like I do now.
XANDER	How's your face?
ANDREW	Okay.
XANDER	Sorry about that. She shouldn't have hit you.
ANDREW	That chick's psycho.
XANDER	You don't know the half of it. She's a Vengeance Demon, you know. She's bad news.
ANDREW	One time I saw her have sex with Spike.
XANDER	She's killed more men than smallpox.
ANDREW	Do people still die of smallpox?
XANDER	She's killed a lot of men. She tortures them. Anyone who incurs her wrath. One time she... No. Never mind
ANDREW	What?
XANDER	It's not important.
ANDREW	What did she do?
XANDER	Well, there was this one guy... There was this one guy... he broke her heart... so she paid him back.
ANDREW	Sounds... bad...
XANDER	Well, then she tore his intestines out and rubbed 'em in his face and took pictures of it.
ANDREW	Oh my god.
XANDER	But she's downstairs now. Don't worry about her.
ANDREW	What --
XANDER	See, the thing is, we've all been a little on edge lately. Some bad things have been happening, and the girls are all looking for someone to blame.
ANDREW	I didn't do anything.
XANDER	I know. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I get that. But they don't. They need answers. It does seem suspicious, you know, you buying blood.
ANDREW	That blood wasn't for me. I was just buying meat.
ANYA	You're gonna tell us what we need to know and you're gonna do it right now --
XANDER	Anya, no!
ANYA	Get off me Harris!
ANDREW	Get her off me! I'll tell you! I'll tell you what you need to know!
BUFFY	Excuse me a second.
SPIKE	Well, we've got ourselves a problem.
BUFFY	Everything okay?
ANYA	Fine.
BUFFY	Okay.
SPIKE	" -- Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me, How could you use a poor maiden so -- "
BUFFY	Who are you talking to?
SPIKE	What's that?
BUFFY	I heard you talking in here. Who were you talking to?
SPIKE	Oh, nobody. Just keeping myself company.
BUFFY	Are you okay?
SPIKE	Fine, How are you?
BUFFY	Spike...
SPIKE	I'm fine, Buffy. Really. Just feel a bit... peckish, I suppose.
ANDREW	But we needed more blood to activate the Seal of Danzal --
BUFFY	He didn't seem to want anything to do with me. He just knocked me aside and charged at the wall.
WILLOW	Are you hurt?
DAWN	How's what's-his-name?.
XANDER	He's got a good chunk taken out of his neck, but he'll be all right. Had to tie him up again, but mostly just to keep him from scratching at his bandages. What the hell happened up there?
BUFFY	I don't know. Spike and I were talking, and he was fine -- well, he wasn't fine, but he was... Spike -- and then I went to check on you guys and when I came back it was like he was... ..a completely different person...
WILLOW	Like "different" William the Bloody- type different?
BUFFY	He was talking to someone up there -- I heard him through the door. He was having a conversation... And then he started singing.
ANYA	Maybe it's another musical. A much crappier musical.
BUFFY	Spike mentioned a song when we were in the cellar. He changed there, too. Instantly became another person.
XANDER	Trigger.
ANYA	The horse?
XANDER	No. In his head. It's a trigger.
WILLOW	This left over from your days in the Army?
XANDER	No, this is left over from every army movie I've ever seen, but it makes sense.
BUFFY	Spike's been saying he's been seeing things since I found him in the basement...
DAWN	He gets his soul back. He starts seeing ghosts. He goes extra, extra crazy.
BUFFY	This trigger... how do we holster... or I mean, safety... I don't know guns. How do we make it stop?
XANDER	Well, usually the operative completes his task and then either blows his head off or steals a submarine.
BUFFY	All right -- I need information. If Spike's a bomb I need to know how to diffuse him.
SPIKE	Did I hurt anybody?
BUFFY	Well, you took a good bite out of Andrew --
SPIKE	Who?
BUFFY	Tucker's brother.
SPIKE	Ah.
BUFFY	But he'll live.
SPIKE	I don't remember...
BUFFY	It's okay.
SPIKE	Buffy -- I don't know... why...
BUFFY	We think we know what's wrong with you.
SPIKE	Kill me.
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Buffy, you have to kill me.
BUFFY	No, you don't understand. When I left the room earlier, I heard you talking to --
SPIKE	Do you have any idea what I'm capable of?
BUFFY	I was in the cellar with you. I saw what you did.
SPIKE	I'm not talking about the cellar. The people in the cellar got off easy. I'm talking about me. See, you don't know me. You only met hamstrung-Angel-Spike. You only met conditioned-chip-Spike. You never met the real me.
BUFFY	Believe me, I'm well aware what you're capable of.
SPIKE	You got off easy, too . Do you know how much blood you can drink from a girl before she'll die? I do. See, the trick is, if you drink just enough... if you damage them just enough ... you can keep them alive for weeks. You can make yourself a plaything.
BUFFY	Something is playing with you, Spike. This isn't your fault. You're not doing this.
SPIKE	I already did it. It's already done. Do you know what I used to do to girls Dawn's age?
BUFFY	We can keep you locked up. Give us time and we can --
SPIKE	Have you ever stopped to think about why you can't kill me? After everything I've done? To you. To the people around you. Have you ever wondered why you keep me alive? It's not love, we both know that.
BUFFY	You fought by my side. You've saved lives, helped --
SPIKE	Don't. Don't do that. Don't rationalize this into some noble act. You don't get to do that .
BUFFY	No...
SPIKE	You need the pain we cause you. You need the violence inside. You need the hate . It gives you the strength to do what you have to do. To be the Slayer. But it's killing you.
BUFFY	You don't have any idea what you're talking about.
SPIKE	You have to let it go.
I	will come for you and I will --
BUFFY	I don't hate myself, Spike . Not anymore. You think you have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? You don't know me.
SPIKE	There's no one else --
BUFFY	You're not alive because of pain. You're not alive because of hate. You're alive because I saw you change. I see your penance.
SPIKE	Window dressing.
BUFFY	There's a man in there underneath that monster. A man who -- even when he had no soul --
SPIKE	-- It's window dressing --
BUFFY	-- struggled to find redemption. You're alive because I know he's in there --
SPIKE	-- I'm killing you --
BUFFY	-- and I believe in the man he can be.
SPIKE	Buffy!
WILLOW	Propel.
BUFFY	Dawn?
XANDER	She's okay. Is this it? I thought there were more of them --
BUFFY	Spike --
XANDER	They were so fast, organized --
BUFFY	They were going after Spike all along.
XANDER	We were just in the way.
BUFFY	I know these guys...
BLAKE	...they took our files, wiped out our records. We've lost contact with operations in Munich, Switzerland, and Rome and we've got casualty confirmations coming in from as far away as Melbourne.
QUENTIN	It's all right, Blake.. "We are still masters of our fate, we are still captain of our souls."
BLAKE	Yes sir.
QUENTIN	Ladies and gentlemen...
QUENTIN	We'll be paying a visit to the Hellmouth.
SPIKE	You'll have to excuse the imagery...
BUFFY	I have to admit, though. This way's much more fun.
DAWN	So the basement was filled with bodies?
WILLOW	Apparently.
DAWN	And Spike could have sired countless others and buried them around town?
WILLOW	It's not that simple.
ANYA	I think we should just stab him through the chest. Isn't that what we do when these things happen?
WILLOW	Buffy knows what she's doing.
ANYA	Xander, you know what we're talking about. You've always been in the "Spike is evil" faction.
XANDER	I have a house to put back together.
ANYA	Fine. You guys keep your heads in the sand. But I think we should all prepare ourselves for the possibility that William the Bloody is back.
WARREN	All right! Looking good. How do you feel?
ANDREW	Good.
WARREN	Excellent. We've got work to do.
ANDREW	Do we have to do work right now? Can't I just... walk around for a while? In my coat?
WARREN	Oh, don't go soft on me now. We're in the trench and the exhaust port's in sight.
ANDREW	I thought that was it. It's not my fault it didn't work. I did what you told me. Why do I have to do all the wet works?
WARREN	Hey, you know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. Here -- feel.
ANDREW	Cool.
WARREN	Yeah, it's pretty bitchin'. I'm like Obi-Wan.
ANDREW	Or Patrick Swayze...

JONATHAN	Okay, calm down. We can work around that.
SPIKE	Don't...
WOOD	Now we can settle this one of two ways: You can help repaint the walls or I can suspend you and report the incident on your permanent record.
HOFFMAN	Fine. Do that.
GRIMES	We'll repaint it.
WOOD	Good.
DAWN	Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
DAWN	I just wanted to tell you that Buffy won't be coming in today. She's really sick.

XANDER	He's got a good chunk taken out of his neck, but he'll be all right. Had to tie him up again, but mostly just to keep him from scratching at his bandages. What the hell happened up there?
BUFFY	I don't know. Spike and I were talking, and he was fine -- well, he wasn't fine, but he was... Spike -- and then I went to check on you guys and when I came back it was like he was... ..a completely different person...
WILLOW	Like "different" William the Bloody- type different?
BUFFY	He was talking to someone up there -- I heard him through the door. He was having a conversation... And then he started singing.
ANYA	Maybe it's another musical. A much crappier musical.
BUFFY	Spike mentioned a song when we were in the cellar. He changed there, too. Instantly became another person.
XANDER	Trigger.
ANYA	The horse?
XANDER	No. In his head. It's a trigger.
WILLOW	This left over from your days in the Army?
XANDER	No, this is left over from every army movie I've ever seen, but it makes sense.
BUFFY	Spike's been saying he's been seeing things since I found him in the basement...
DAWN	He gets his soul back. He starts seeing ghosts. He goes extra, extra crazy.
BUFFY	This trigger... how do we holster... or I mean, safety... I don't know guns. How do we make it stop?
XANDER	Well, usually the operative completes his task and then either blows his head off or steals a submarine.
BUFFY	All right -- I need information. If Spike's a bomb I need to know how to diffuse him.
SPIKE	Did I hurt anybody?
BUFFY	Well, you took a good bite out of Andrew --
SPIKE	Who?
BUFFY	Tucker's brother.
SPIKE	Ah.
BUFFY	But he'll live.
SPIKE	I don't remember...
BUFFY	It's okay.
SPIKE	Buffy -- I don't know... why...
BUFFY	We think we know what's wrong with you.
SPIKE	Kill me.
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Buffy, you have to kill me.
BUFFY	No, you don't understand. When I left the room earlier, I heard you talking to --
SPIKE	Do you have any idea what I'm capable of?
BUFFY	I was in the cellar with you. I saw what you did.
SPIKE	I'm not talking about the cellar. The people in the cellar got off easy. I'm talking about me. See, you don't know me. You only met hamstrung-Angel-Spike. You only met conditioned-chip-Spike. You never met the real me.
BUFFY	Believe me, I'm well aware what you're capable of.
SPIKE	You got off easy, too . Do you know how much blood you can drink from a girl before she'll die? I do. See, the trick is, if you drink just enough... if you damage them just enough ... you can keep them alive for weeks. You can make yourself a plaything.
BUFFY	Something is playing with you, Spike. This isn't your fault. You're not doing this.
SPIKE	I already did it. It's already done. Do you know what I used to do to girls Dawn's age?
BUFFY	We can keep you locked up. Give us time and we can --
SPIKE	Have you ever stopped to think about why you can't kill me? After everything I've done? To you. To the people around you. Have you ever wondered why you keep me alive? It's not love, we both know that.
BUFFY	You fought by my side. You've saved lives, helped --
SPIKE	Don't. Don't do that. Don't rationalize this into some noble act. You don't get to do that .
BUFFY	No...
SPIKE	You need the pain we cause you. You need the violence inside. You need the hate . It gives you the strength to do what you have to do. To be the Slayer. But it's killing you.
BUFFY	You don't have any idea what you're talking about.
SPIKE	You have to let it go.
I	will come for you and I will --
BUFFY	I don't hate myself, Spike . Not anymore. You think you have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? You don't know me.
SPIKE	There's no one else --
BUFFY	You're not alive because of pain. You're not alive because of hate. You're alive because I saw you change. I see your penance.
SPIKE	Window dressing.
BUFFY	There's a man in there underneath that monster. A man who -- even when he had no soul --
SPIKE	-- It's window dressing --
BUFFY	-- struggled to find redemption. You're alive because I know he's in there --
SPIKE	-- I'm killing you --
BUFFY	-- and I believe in the man he can be.
BUFFY	Dawn?
XANDER	She's okay. Is this it? I thought there were more of them --
XANDER	They were so fast, organized --
BUFFY	They were going after Spike all along.
QUENTIN	We'll be paying a visit to the Hellmouth.

DAWN	Candles? We can't have candles?
BUFFY	It's a magic clearance, Dawn. Everything must go.
DAWN	But... they're just candles.
BUFFY	To you and me, they're just candles. To witches, they're like... bongs.
WILLOW	Bird.
BUFFY	I'll make sure she gets them back.
BUFFY	Dawn, do me a favor and grab that fertility god statue on the shelf.
DAWN	Kokopelli? No! I love him! And he was Mom's. Why do we have to get rid of so many things I like?
BUFFY	I explained this, Dawn. Willow's got... a problem. And these next few weeks are gonna be crazy hard on her as it is...
WARREN	Okay. That's it. It's finally done.
JONATHAN	kinda clunky looking.
WARREN	What?!
ANDREW	Yeah, I was picturing something cooler. More ILM, less Ed Wood.
WARREN	Wanna see cool? I'll show you cool.
JONATHAN	Mama
WARREN	That was only half the test.
JONATHAN	Hey! Hey--
BUFFY	C'mon, Dawn, you need to eat your breakfast. Xander'll be here any sec!
WILLOW	Not sure. I think I put too much milk in the eggs. And was I supposed to cook the bacon before I diced it and threw it in?
BUFFY	I meant... "Doing, feeling-wise."
WILLOW	Oh. M'okay. Not "ready to return to classes, face the world" okay, but shakiness only semi now. Thought I'd spend the day fishing the net for more poop on that stolen diamond.
BUFFY	I called you before.
DAWN	Couldn't hear you.
WILLOW	'Morning, Dawnie. Making you a tasty omelette. Or possibly scrambled eggs.
DAWN	I'm not hungry.
BUFFY	You need to eat something.
DAWN	Thanks for your concern. Nice to know you're always there for me.
WILLOW	'kay, I deserve the wrath of Dawn. But why's she taking it out on you?
BUFFY	Because I let it happen.
WILLOW	Buffy, I was the one who --
BUFFY	Was drowning. My best friend. And I was too wrapped up in my dumb life to notice. Too busy--
SPIKE	(real casual) 'Morning.
BUFFY	What-- What are you doing? And here?
SPIKE	Just... taking a stroll. Found myself in your neck o' the woods.
BUFFY	Couldn't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll?
SPIKE	Yeah, well, fact is my lighter's gone missing. Thought it mighta dropped outta my pocket last time I was here
BUFFY	Haven't seen it.
WILLOW	Y'know, I think I'll just head on back to my room. Get dressed.
BUFFY	Lame.
SPIKE	What?
BUFFY	You. Making up excuses to--
SPIKE	Don't flatter yourself, Luv. Bloody fond of that lighter.
BUFFY	Stop trying to see me. And stop calling me that.
SPIKE	So what should I call you then? "Pet?" "Sweetheart?"
BUFFY	Um, what the hell's that me-- ohh.
XANDER	You're still trying to mack on Buffy? Wake up already. Never gonna happen.
BUFFY	Uh, hey! You really need to get Dawn to school. Let's go fetch her. You can let yourself out. Right?
BUFFY	Dawn! Xander's here. Come--
DAWN	I'm here.
BUFFY	Oh. Got all your--
DAWN	Yep.
BUFFY	And after school, you'll--
DAWN	(moving to door) Yeah, yeah. Let's go, Xander.
BUFFY	You'll come right home.
DAWN	Sure...
KELLER	Um, good morning. You must be Dawn.
BUFFY	Can I help you?
KELLER	I'm Doris Keller. From Social Services. We had an appointment.
BUFFY	For Wednesday.
KELLER	This is Wednesday.
BUFFY	Right. Dawn, you better get--
XANDER	Yes, ma'am.
KELLER	A little on the tardy side, isn't she?
BUFFY	Yeah, well. Been one of those mornings, y'know?
BUFFY	Excuse the mess. Doing a little house clean--
SPIKE	So, we gonna chat this out or what?
BUFFY	(gritted teeth) I... can't right now. I have company.
SPIKE	No worries. I'll wait.
KELLER	Ms. Summers, if you need some time with your boyfriend, I can--
BUFFY	He's NOT... .. my boyfriend! He's--
SPIKE	Oh, right. Hey, Buffy's a great mum. Takes good care of her li'l sis. Like, when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it.
KELLER	I'm sorry. Did you say--
BUFFY	Crib! He said 'crib.' You know kids with the... buggin' street slang.
SPIKE	Thing, yeah. Uh, my blanket.
KELLER	He sleeps here?
BUFFY	What? No. Oh, the blanket? That's... just a security thing. He's got issues. No, it's just Dawn and me living here.
BUFFY	Oh, okay, Will That's... Willow. She, uh... kinda lives here, too. Actually.
KELLER	So you live with another woman.
BUFFY	Yeah. We're friends. It's not a gay thing. Well, she's gay. But we don't... gay. I mean, not that...
I	swear, it's not what it looks like. It's just some kind of magic weed.
KELLER	Well, I think I've seen enough.
BUFFY	No. No, I don't think you--
KELLER	Then it's been a bad time for a while now, hasn't it, Ms. Summers? Your sister's grades have fallen sharply in the past year, due in large part to her frequent absences and lateness.
BUFFY	There are good reasons--
KELLER	I'm sure there are. But my interest is in Dawn's welfare and the stability of her homelife. Something I'm not convinced an unemployed young woman as yourself can provide.
BUFFY	I can-- I do--
KELLER	Well, we'll have to see about that, won't we? I'll be recommending immediate probation in my report.
BUFFY	W-what does that mean?
KELLER	It means I'll be monitoring you very closely, Ms. Summers And if I don't think things are improving, I'll be forced to recommend you be stripped of your sister's guardianship.
BUFFY	You can't do that.
KELLER	I do what I think's in Dawn's best Interest. As should you. Have a nice day.
BUFFY	Why won't you go?
SPIKE	Just thought you'd want--
BUFFY	Get out of here!!
SPIKE	Just getting what I came for. Luv.
CLEO	Hmm. Well, I... I think I can work... with this. What exactly would you like me to do?
BUFFY	Just make .... . different.
ANDREW	I'm scared. What if we get caught?
JONATHAN	No way. We'll be invisible. Plus their security's gotten lax.
WARREN	You should know, you've cased this joint enough. Okay. This is it.
WARREN	What? Where?
ANDREW	There. Heading this way.
JONATHAN	Gimme that--
ANDREW	No! I need to be invisible.
JONATHAN	I need it more than you--
WARREN	Watch it! Don't push the--
ANDREW	Oopsy.
XANDER	What happened to Buffy? She's gone.
ANYA	She's right here. At table four. I put her with your family.
XANDER	Great. Except we DON'T HATE BUFFY. Put her back at our table.
ANYA	Then where do I put D'Hoffryn?
XANDER	We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
ANYA	I have to! He's my ex-boss! You're inviting your work buddies.
XANDER	Buffy?! Where-- where are you?
ANYA	That remains to be seen. Like you.
XANDER	(yanks his hand) Sorry. Her clothes are... invisible... too.
ANYA	You cut your hair?
ANYA	Oh, that sounds adorable. I was thinking about cutting mine before the wedding, maybe layering it.
XANDER	Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy? This is serious.
BUFFY	Like to see her try now. Y'know, there may be an upside to no-see me.
XANDER	Buff, did you see anyone or anything suspicious before you... cleared up?
ANYA	Why would anyone want to make her invisible anyway? I mean, invisible Slayer's gotta be way more effective than the standard variety.
XANDER	I'm less with the why, and more with the how. We get the how, then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again. Right?
XANDER	Buffy, can you focus please?
ANYA	It would help if we had a little more to go on. Or anything to go on.
XANDER	I could go check out the spot Buffy disappeared. Snoop for clues.
XANDER	A walk?!
XANDER	Buffy!
ANYA	Well, seems pretty obvious it's some kind of spell that's done this to her.
XANDER	A spell from who? You said it yourself... It makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible.
ANYA	Maybe it was a mistake.
XANDER	A magic mistake. Who'd be messing with that kinda pow--
WILLOW	Xander
XANDER	How's it going?
WILLOW	Umn, good. I found out stuff about the diamond stolen from the museum. It's called "The Illuminata" and there's rumors of it having quasi-mystical quantum properties--
XANDER	Will, we need to talk.
WILLOW	We are talking. Well, I'M talking. You're just looking at me funny.
XANDER	Something you wanna tell me?
WILLOW	It was nothing. I didn't slip--
XANDER	Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is part of recovery. We understand that. We just have to figure away to fix it.
WILLOW	Fix what?
XANDER	Fix Buffy.
WILLOW	Buffy's broken?
XANDER	You know what I-- You don't know? Rhymes with "blinvisible?"
WILLOW	What?
XANDER	Buffy was in town, leaving the haircutting place, when she suddenly--
WILLOW	Buffy cut her hair?
XANDER	Yeah. It's adorable. Apparently. I, personally, couldn't tell since she's all... blinvisible.
WILLOW	And... and you think I had something to do with this?
XANDER	No. Not- Well, c'mon, Will. Some of your spells have caused weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another. And let's not forget the recent forgetting.
WILLOW	(getting miffed) Oh, I see. So now when anything nasty happens around here, I get conveniently blamed for it.
XANDER	No one's blaming-
WILLOW	So I guess it wouldn't matter now if I just jump off the wagon completely, since you're already convinced I'm making pit stops.
XANDER	Look, if you say you didn't do it--
XANDER	What is this fascination with walking?
WARREN	A couple of circuits are burned out and wiring's fried...
JONATHAN	But, you can fix it, right?
WARREN	All we can do now is pray. And pick up replacement parts at Radio Shack.
ANDREW	But we had so many plans. Naked women and... all the naked women. This is your fault. If you hadn't grabbed it from me--
JONATHAN	Hey, we got a lot bigger problem, bonehead. The Slayer's invisible now.
ANDREW	(with mounting drama) He's right! She could be anywhere. Even here. Right now. Watching. Listening to every word we say! For all we know, she could be ONE OF US!
WARREN	I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.
JONATHAN	Says you. In my book, an invisible Slayer Means a world of trouble.
MAN	(looking up, stunned) Hey... Hey! That's -- Stop!
KELLER	(looking around) What? Where did--?
KELLER	(looking around) What?!
WORKER	I didn't say anything.
KELLER	(snapping at her) Not you! The mug! It's--
KELLER	Stop it! Shut up!!!
FRANK	Doris, I've got a few, so if you want to discuss that case file now...
KELLER	What? Oh. Yes. The Summers file. It's right over here.
FRANK	What is this? "All work and no play Make Doris a dull girl?"
KELLER	What?
FRANK	"All work and no play make Doris...!" The pages are filled with it.
KELLER	I didn't do that! I-- It was the voice!
FRANK	Excuse me?
KELLER	There was a voice. Before. It made my coffee dance. And told me to...
FRANK	To... what?
KELLER	N-nothing.
FRANK	Doris... Are you taking any prescription medication?
KELLER	No! God, no!
FRANK	Well, maybe you should. Take the rest of the day off. See your doctor.
KELLER	But -- But my cases...
FRANK	I'll put someone else on them. Redo the... Summers interview.
XANDER	Hey. Will. What are you--?
WILLOW	(a little testy) Look, Xander. I figured out this was the spot Buffy disappeared from what you told me. So don't start jumping to any conclusions.
XANDER	No jumping. Look! Feet firmly planted.
WILLOW	Not feeling myself right now. Sorry.
XANDER	Me, too, sorry.
WILLOW	Take a look at this...
XANDER	Those coulda been made anytime.
XANDER	What is it?
WILLOW	Paint I scraped off the fire hydrant.
XANDER	What fire hyd-- Oww!
WILLOW	Something hit this hydrant after it was made invisible. And betcha-by-golly-wow that something was the same something that shot out of this alley.
XANDER	Black paint. Buffy's phantom van. We should let her know-whoa--
WILLOW	It's... It's a pylon. One of those orange traffic cones. You should take it back to the magic shop.
XANDER	Trying to save a good parking space?
WILLOW	It might help you and Anya figure out what kind of spell was used.
XANDER	Oh, fun. What about you?
WILLOW	Got paint scrapings and a tire track. I'm gonna try to find that van that's been stalking Buf-- By the way... Where is Buffy?
SPIKE	Whatever beastie you are... I know you're here. And I hurt beasties.
ANYA	I've got it!
XANDER	Really?
ANYA	We'll put D'Hoffryn at your parent's table and move your Uncle Rory to Table 5, next to the bar--
XANDER	Ahn, honey! we're looking for invisibility spells here.
ANYA	Well, obviously, I haven't found anything yet.At least nothing that would explain why things near Buffy became invisible like--
XANDER	What happened?
ANYA	An unpleasant tactile experience. Like putting my hand in pudding.
XANDER	Ew.
ANYA	Pudding, am I right? Rice. Or tapioca. Lumpy like that.
XANDER	The cone's losing its substance. Like it's breaking down or something. We have to find Buffy. She's gotta know.
ANYA	I don't think she'll be broken up over a pylon.
XANDER	Anya. What's happening to the pylon, will probably happen to her. If we don't find Buffy... I mean, if we don't figure out how this was done...
ANYA	She's pudding?
JONATHAN	Whatta you mean she's gonna fade away?
WARREN	The Slayer got slammed with a big ass dose of radiation when the gun overloaded. Her cells are mutating at an accelerated rate. Eventually her molecular makeup will start losing its integrity and... pfft.
ANDREW	But... wouldn't that... kill her?
WARREN	Well, lemme think... Yeah!
JONATHAN	Wait a minute. We're not killing anybody. Especially not Buffy.
WARREN	Geez, you guys are so immature. We're villains! When are you gonna get that through your thick skulls?
JONATHAN	We're not killers! We're Crime Lords!
ANDREW	Yeah! Like Lex Luthor. He's always trying to take over Metropolis, but he never kills Superman.'
WARREN	'Cause it's Superman's book, moron!
ANDREW	But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?
JONATHAN	Listen, Warren. You get that ray working and the first thing we're gonna do is find Buffty and revisible her before it's too late. You got me?
WARREN	Fine. Whatever you guys say.
XANDER	Spike?
XANDER	Spike?
SPIKE	(thinking fast) What am I...? What's it look like, ya nit? I'm... exercising, aren't I?
XANDER	Exercising. Naked. In Bed.
SPIKE	Man shouldn't use immortality as an excuse to let himself go. Gotta keep fit for the killing.
XANDER	Yuh-huh. Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs. Mini-disaster area.
SPIKE	So, what, you just come here to criticize my housekeeping?
XANDER	No. I'm... I'm looking for Buffy.
SPIKE	Haven't seen her.
XANDER	Well, you wouldn't. Fact is, she's come down with a slight case of invisibility.
SPIKE	(feigning surprise) Yeah? Huh. How did, uh--?
XANDER	We don't know yet.
SPIKE	Uh, tell you what. I'll take a peek around first chance I get. And if we bump into each other, I'll clue her you're on the lookout.
XANDER	(squinting at him) After your... exercises.
SPIKE	Yeah. Right.
XANDER	Y'know... kidding aside, Spike... You really should get a girlfriend.
SPIKE	That was bloody stupid.
SPIKE	Perfect for you.
I	thought this is what you wanted.
SPIKE	What I want... This vanishing act's right liberating for you, in'it? Be anywhere you want. Do anything you want. Or anyone.
SPIKE	Only reason you're here is that You're not here.
SPIKE	Both know it's true, Luv. So, skip the denial. May not be able to see you, but I can still see through you.
SPIKE	Not too put off by it though, are ya?
SPIKE	Fun's over. Just go. Get dressed, if you can find your clothes and push off. 'Cause if I can't have all of you, I'd rather--
DAWN	(looking around) Buffy? W-where are you?
DAWN	What-- What are you talking--?
DAWN	Stop it. Just... stop!
DAWN	What'd you think would happen?! You're... freakin' invisible, Buffy!
DAWN	What about you? Shouldn't you be working on it? Don't you even care?
DAWN	You're not acting like it. Don't you care about who did this to you or... or if you're stuck this way?
DAWN	Do you even care that I just got in when I'm supposed to be home by five. You're not even grilling me about where I was and who I was with.
DAWN	That's not the point.
DAWN	I can't talk to you like this! I can't see you! How can I talk to you when I can't see you scowling at me?
WILLOW	Cool.
WILLOW	Hey -- Get off me!
WILLOW	Buffy!
WILLOW	He's bluffing, Buffy. There's only three of them. I think.
BUFFY	I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you're the ones that did this to me.
WILLOW	They're the ones in your mystery van.
WILLOW	They told me everything, Buffy. Something's happening to you. You're--
WILLOW	You're on the wrong setting.
WILLOW	The gun. It's not set for reversing the particle ionization. It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution! I saw the plans!
WILLOW	Buffy, he's trying to kill you--
BUFFY	And I promise, you're all going down.
BUFFY	Jonathan?
ANDREW	Andrew. I summoned the flying monkeys that attacked the high school.
WILLOW	Ohhh.
BUFFY	So you three have... what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
WARREN	We're your arch nemeses. You may've beaten us this time, Slayer. But next time... Umm... next time...
JONATHAN	Maybe not.
WARREN	What do you mean it's locked? You were supposed to check it.
JONATHAN	I forgot!
BUFFY	(to Willow, re Trio) I give you my arch nemeses.
GUARD	I got a bunch a scared kids saying this place is haunted.
WILLOW	Oh my God, Buffy...
BUFFY	I know. They're gone.
WILLOW	No, your hair. It is adorable.
BUFFY	Pretty neat your finding the van. So what did you... do... exactly? I mean, how'd you manage to locate--
WILLOW	The hard way! The spell-free, all Natural, oh-my-god-my-head's-gonna- fall-off-feet-are-killing-me way.
BUFFY	Well... The important thing is you did. It's a... good first step.
WILLOW	Well, sure. Who wouldn't?
BUFFY	Me. I wouldn't. Not too long ago. I probably would've welcomed it. But when he told me...I realized... Not saying I'm doing backflips about my life, but... But, I didn't... I mean, I don't...want to die. That's something, right?
WILLOW	It's something.
BUFFY	I guess.
WILLOW	Yay for us.
BUFFY	Yay.

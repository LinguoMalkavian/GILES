BUFFY	Who's got it... who knows how to use it...
DAWN	Well, I've got the stake...
BUFFY	The stake is not the power.
DAWN	But he's new... probably confused, doesn't know what he wants...
VAMPIRE	Blood...
BUFFY	He seems to have some focus there...
DAWN	Yeah, ok, but he doesn't know his strength, he might not know all the fancy martial arts they inevitably seem to pick up...
BUFFY	Who's got the power?
DAWN	He does.
BUFFY	Never forget that. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are, how well armed you are, you're a little girl.
DAWN	Woman.
BUFFY	You're a little woman.
DAWN	I'm taller than you.
BUFFY	He's a vampire . Okay? A demon. Preternaturally strong, skilled, with power that no human can ever --
VAMPIRE	I think I'm stuck.
BUFFY	You're stuck.
VAMPIRE	My foot's caught on a root or something. I don't even know how I got down there... if you girls could just give me a hand...
DAWN	So he's got the power.
BUFFY	Zip it.
VAMPIRE	I really appreciate it... it's just so dark, and I don't know what I'm doing here... Maybe if you just give me some leverage I can work --
BUFFY	Listen up. I'm the Slayer, you don't wanna get into it with me. You want blood, okay? So you can have hers. She's not the Slayer. She's the one to go after. Not me.
VAMPIRE	I was thinking along those lines.
BUFFY	Okay then.
DAWN	Buffy!!
BUFFY	It's real. That's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real.
DAWN	Just a scrape. Anyway I had a plan the whole time.
BUFFY	Really.
DAWN	Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire and bite you .
BUFFY	You wanted to be trained...
DAWN	"The Stake is not the power..." Thank you, Master Prada.
BUFFY	Geez, one violent near-death experience and you're suddenly all testy.
DAWN	Just next time you're gonna --
BUFFY	You did pretty well.
DAWN	I did?
BUFFY	Yeah.
DAWN	'Cause with the rolling thing, I was using his strength, it was very tai chi, plus I nearly got the heart --
BUFFY	My first time out I missed the heart too.
DAWN	No way.
BUFFY	Just the once.
DAWN	Well the next vampire I meet --
BUFFY	The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.
DAWN	I know. I just can't believe it's back.
BUFFY	Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few more days 'til it starts -- and then we'll never know what's coming next.
VOICE	It is my great pleasure and privilege to announce the official opening, on the very ground it first stood upon...
WOOD	... of the brand new, state of the art... Sunnydale High!
GILES	That doesn't belong there.
WILLOW	No, it doesn't.
GILES	Passafloracoerulea, native to Paraguay, if my botany serves.
WILLOW	Is there anything you don't know everything about?
GILES	Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me. Other than that, I know all. Yes, Paraguayan. Where did it come from?
WILLOW	Paraguay.
GILES	You brought it through the earth.
WILLOW	It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules, the energy... everything's connected.
GILES	You sound like Ms. Harkness.
GILES	Then why aren't you at your lesson?
WILLOW	I'm sorry.
GILES	It's all right. She was just afraid you --
WILLOW	Had gone evil? Yeah, I was gonna destroy the world, but lunch made me sleepy.
GILES	She didn't think that. She was just --
WILLOW	Afraid. They all are. The Coven is... they're the most amazing women I've ever met. If it wasn't for them, and you... But there's this look they get, like I'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash or something. Which I'm not even sure what that is.
GILES	They're cautious. I trust you can understand that.
WILLOW	I don't have that much power, I don't think. I was... drained by what happened.
GILES	But everything's connected. You're connected to great power, whether you feel it or not.
WILLOW	You should just take it from me.
GILES	You know we can't. This isn't a hobby, or an addiction. It's inside you now, this magic. You're responsible for it.
WILLOW	Will they always be afraid of me?
GILES	Maybe. Can you live with that?
WILLOW	I deserve a lot worse.
GILES	That's not an answer.
WILLOW	I killed people, Giles.
GILES	I've not forgotten.
WILLOW	When you brought me here... I thought it was to kill me. Or lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity, or with the torture... instead, you go all Dumbledore on me, I'm learning about magic, I'm all about energy and gaia and root systems.
GILES	Do you want to be punished?
WILLOW	I wanna be Willow.
GILES	You are. In the end, we are all who we are -- no matter now much we may appear to have changed.
BUFFY	Dawn! Xander's here!
BUFFY	You're gonna be late!
XANDER	Morning --
BUFFY	You gotta eat! I made cereal!
BUFFY	You're unconscionably spiffy.
XANDER	Client meeting. How exactly do you 'make' cereal?
BUFFY	You put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. You want anything?
XANDER	I ate, I'm good. How are you?
BUFFY	My sister's about to go to the same school that tried to kill me for three years. I can't afford private school, I can't change districts, and I can't begin to prepare her for what could come out of there, so peachy with a side of keen, that would be me.
XANDER	Well, here's a little something for what ails you.
BUFFY	You got the rest of it?
XANDER	Take a look.
DAWN	Check out Double-Oh-Xander.
BUFFY	Go talk with your mouth full.
XANDER	I got two crews working this diabolical yet lucrative new campus: finishing up the science building here, and reinforcing the gym. No pentagrams, no secret passageways... everything up to code and safe as houses. I've looked through all the plans, I've been on site after hours...
BUFFY	Nothing's creepy? Strange? From Beyond?
DAWN	Murbee yr paranuhd.
XANDER	Well there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plans for the OLD high school. You remember, the very center of Sunnydale's own hellmouth --
BUFFY	It was under the library.
XANDER	Right. So I lined up the plans, new and old --
BUFFY	... the principal's office.
DAWN	So the principal is evil?
BUFFY	Or in a boatload of danger.
XANDER	The last two principals were eaten. Who'd even apply for that gig?
BUFFY	I guess we'll see. Time to head out Got your books? Lunch? Stakes?
DAWN	Check thrice.
XANDER	Did you give her...
BUFFY	Saving it.
DAWN	What is this?
BUFFY	Back to school gift.
DAWN	It's a weapon, isn't it?
BUFFY	Yes it is.
BUFFY	I'm gonna take her to class. Have a look around.
XANDER	Okay. I'll be on site here most of the day, so if you have needs...
BUFFY	Thanks.
DAWN	I got it.
BUFFY	Stay away from hyena people, lizardy- type athletes... if you see anyone invisible --
DAWN	Buffy. I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not gonna see anyone that's invisible.
BUFFY	You could still drop out. Only nerds finish school.
DAWN	I really don't think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my first day of high school, because it is so redundant.
BUFFY	This place is evil.
BUFFY	Oh. Hi.
WOOD	Robin Wood. I'm the new principal.
BUFFY	Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.
WOOD	Nice to meet you.
DAWN	Hi.
BUFFY	So you're the principal. I expected you to be more... aged.
BUFFY	No! Oh. No. Sister.
BUFFY	You didn't really think... Is it my hair? Do I have mom hair?
WOOD	I have actually heard of you, Ms. Summers. You graduated from the old high school, am I right?
BUFFY	Yeah. How did you --
WOOD	Well, I better get to work. Got to start deadening young minds. It was nice to meet you. You have fun.
BUFFY	Well that was suspicious.
DAWN	You betchya. Bye.
BUFFY	Dawn --
DAWN	I know. You never see it coming, the stake is not the power, To Serve Man is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.
TEACHER	Well, okay. I'm Mr. Lonegrin. Why don't we go around the room and introduce ourselves. Let's start with...
DAWN	... and my sister is a vampire slayer, her best friend is a witch who went bonkers and tried to destroy the world, um, I actually used to be a little ball of energy until about two years ago when some monks changed the past and made me Buffy's sister and for some reason, a big klepto. My best friends are Leticia Jones, who moved to San Diego because this town is evil, and a floppy eared demon named Clem.
STUDENT	... Die Hard, Spiderman, and the Matrix, I'm hoping to try out for the swim team this year, I love to swim, and uh, I hope I don't flunk.
BUFFY	It's not mom hair...
GIRL	You can't protect her...
JANITOR	GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!
ANYA	God, they're depressing.
HALLIE	Who are they kidding with that happy shiny crap?
ANYA	Six weeks, tops, and she's calling on me for vengeance.
HALLIE	Ooh, he'd better run for cover...
ANYA	What's that supposed to mean?
HALLIE	Sweetie, you know exactly what it means. (off her look) You're not keeping your end up!
ANYA	Excuse me?
HALLIE	It's the talk of the Order. They're calling you Ms. Soft-Serve. Tell me you don't know this.
ANYA	I.. Who...
HALLIE	Listen, Anya, I know I've been a little competitive with you, there was that thing during the Crimean War, we laugh about it now, but the fact is I've actually always looked up to you. You were the single most hard-core vengeance demon on the roster and everybody knew it. A woman was wronged, you were on her like icky on poo, granting a wish that was guaranteed to make her ex -- and her -- regret they'd ever heard of romance. Do I have to mention Mrs. Czolgosz?
ANYA	Good times...
HALLIE	You lost your powers -- it happens -- and you fell for this Xander guy.
ANYA	It was a glitch! A summer thing! I'm SO back in the vengeance fold!
HALLIE	Yeah-huh. You're a terror.
ANYA	I've been granting vengeance wishes like a frito bandito and you know it.
HALLIE	No deaths, no eviscerations -- you're not goading women into anything inventive and you're not delivering when it is!
ANYA	I don't even know --
HALLIE	Waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog, you made him French!
ANYA	Well that's a... he's smelly, and with the little mustache...
HALLIE	Anya, if it was just me, I'd say, "fine, she's not about the hard justice..."
ANYA	What do you mean, if it was just you?
HALLIE	D'hoffryn, the lower beings, they're all feeling the heat... something's rising. Something older than the old ones and everybody's tail is twitching. This is a bad time to be a good guy. You haven't felt any of this?
ANYA	I have, I just... I just need to sort things out.
HALLIE	You need to get your vengeance on, doodle-bug. Before they come after you.
ANYA	So, is this an intervention? Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?
HALLIE	Sweetie, they are.
DAWN	... history, and sociology, I love to dance, I like music, I'm very into Britney Spears' early work, you know before she sold out, so mostly her finger painting, macaroni art...
BUFFY	Dawn!
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	We gotta go. It's not safe.
DAWN	But...
BUFFY	We, I mean I saw...
TEACHER	Can I help you?
BUFFY	No, I... just I thought you were in danger of, um... smoking, and let's not, kids, 'cause it's not cool to... I'll be around.
DAWN	I also have a sister.
XANDER	Tell Ronnie to let the other guys finish upstairs. So, how's it looking? Does the place pass inspection?
BUFFY	It's great, if you're a zombie-ghost- thing.
XANDER	So school's in session, huh?
BUFFY	Seems like old times.
XANDER	S' wonderful.
BUFFY	I'm not sure. They were in the mirror, they disappeared, but they touched me. I think. Let's just start with "dead" and "pissed".
XANDER	They were after you personally?
BUFFY	Talked about protecting people. Told me to leave.
XANDER	No damage, though.
BUFFY	I think I may have destroyed Dawn's social life in all of thirty seconds, but apart from that, no.
BUFFY	I don't know. You could blow up the school again...
XANDER	That never gets old...
BUFFY	It's not a coincidence, you know. The school being rebuilt. It means something... more.
XANDER	As in what?
NERD	Can I borrow a pencil?
TEACHER	Are you all right?
DAWN	I'm sorry, I'm sorry... there was a... a bee flew at my eye, I'm very allergic...
TEACHER	I think it's gone...
DAWN	Can I... can I got to the bathroom?
TEACHER	Of course.
DAWN	What happened to the... never mind.
STUDENT	Guess it runs in the family.
WOOD	Whoa.
BUFFY	Sorry.
WOOD	Ms Summers. I didn't know you were still about.
BUFFY	Well, I was looking...
WOOD	I thought generally it was customary for a person who has graduated to, um, go somewhere else.
BUFFY	It's a new campus. I just want to get to know it. Make sure it's all right. For my sister.
DAWN	Hey, what's wrong...
KIT	There's someone... in here...
DAWN	It's only me.
KIT	No. It's not.
WOOD	You know, I actually know a little more about you than I let on before.
BUFFY	Isn't that interesting.
WOOD	It really is.
DAWN	Let's just get you out of here, okay? We're gonna be all right. But maybe we could get some air.
KIT	Kit.
DAWN	Saw something pretty creepy, huh?
KIT	You won't believe me.
DAWN	I kinda sorta think I will. Was there a pencil involved in any --
GILES	Breathe... just breathe...
WILLOW	Giles... I can't... goddess...
GILES	Just breathe.
WILLOW	What happened?
GILES	What do you remember?
WILLOW	We were talking. And I felt --
GILES	The Hellmouth.
WILLOW	It's gonna open. It's gonna swallow us all.
KIT	Hey, wake up... please wake up...
DAWN	Oh, God.
KIT	We have to leave.
DAWN	You're not wrong.
KIT	A girl. She said she died here. That everybody dies here and we all would too.
DAWN	And here I was worried about not fitting in.
CARLOS	Who are you?
KIT	Who are you?
DAWN	Are you dead?
CARLOS	Stop saying that!
DAWN	Whoa, Whoa... we're not dead, we saw scary dead people, we're trying to get out of here.
CARLOS	I just came down for a smoke, you know, and I saw... it was the janitor, yelling at me, I thought he was just pissed, but I saw him in the light...
DAWN	You came downstairs. WHERE?
CARLOS	Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl, I don't know this place at all.
DAWN	Okay, so we can run around in circles, or --
JANITOR	You really think you can run away?
KIT	It's not real...
DAWN	Lesson one: It's always real.
NERD	I tried to run, too.
GIRL	I tried to scream .
DAWN	Hear me, right... I got a present... my sister gave me a present.
KIT	What is it?
DAWN	A weapon.
WOOD	The school board recommended I spend some time reading your record. It's a page turner. Kind of a checkered past.
WOOD	Well, your sister clearly looks up to you --
BUFFY	Hey! That's loud.
WOOD	That's part of why we don't allow --
BUFFY	'Scuse me. Uh huh? (to Wood) Sorry. It's my dog. My dog walker. Three dead?
BUFFY	...Yeah...
WOOD	Your dogs are dead?
BUFFY	I'll be right there.
DAWN	Good. And, Buffy...
BUFFY	Yeah?
DAWN	Isn't this reception amazing? I'm in the frikkin' basement!
WOOD	Of course... good luck with your... dog tragedy...
BUFFY	Dawn!
JANITOR	Sure as hell didn't save me ...
BUFFY	Where's my sister?
BUFFY	If I'm the one that let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here... What are you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?
NERD	I think I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend...
BUFFY	Again, wrong sister. I'm the one that dates dead guys. And no offense, but they were hotties. I mean, I'm sure you had a great personality...
GIRL	Were you busy making out with your dead boyfriend when I was ripped to death by a werewolf? Is that why you let me die?
NERD	I was screaming for help when they pulled me down into the --
JANITOR	She's not gonna hear you. Place is like a maze, it just swallows up sound.
I	know.
BUFFY	What do you want?
JANITOR	You don't belong here.
GIRL	This place is ours, now. It's built on our graves. We rested easy until we felt you return.
JANITOR	Leave. Leave and never come back.
BUFFY	I'd love to. Really. But --
JANITOR	Dawn is fine. She's sitting in class right now, not remembering any of this. We don't care about her. All we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.
BUFFY	Actually, I think all you want is to get between me and that door.
BUFFY	Spike...?
BUFFY	What? What duck? There's a duck?
SPIKE	No visitors today... terribly busy...
NERD	Told you to get out...
BUFFY	They'll probably show up in a sec --
SPIKE	Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.
BUFFY	Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down with some kids --
SPIKE	DON'T YOU THINK I'M TRYING?!? Ooh, not a fast, not a quick STUDY... I dropped my board in the water and the chalk all ran, sure to be caned... ...should've seen that coming...
BUFFY	Spike... what happened...
BUFFY	Dawn?
DAWN	Buffy... where are you?
BUFFY	I'm... where are you?
DAWN	I don't know. A room, by the furnace, near where we fell in.... they dragged us in here then disappeared...
BUFFY	Yeah, they came after me.
SPIKE	Not in here, they'd not dare... no solicitation, thank you...
DAWN	What do they want?
BUFFY	So far, to piss me off.
DAWN	Please tell me it's working.
BUFFY	Oh, I'm damage bound. I just can't figure them -- ghosts can't touch you and zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what we're --
SPIKE	Not ghosts...
BUFFY	Hold on...
SPIKE	Manifest spirits, controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance... a four-year old could figure it...
BUFFY	Spike, you gonna help me out?
SPIKE	THIS IS MY HOME! I belong here, I've always been here, cheers for stopping by.
BUFFY	I'll get back to you.
DAWN	We need some kind of weapon. Just to hold them off.
CARLOS	I got these...
DAWN	I guess that's better than... ... Kit. Give me your bag.
KIT	Do you think they'll come back?
GIRL	Do you think they'll come back?
KIT	No...
GIRL	Why do you think we picked you? The ones no one will miss... the ones that don't belong... Spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll never ever leave.
JANITOR	You can thank your sister for this.
DAWN	Thanks, sis.
BUFFY	We just gotta hold 'em at bay --
DAWN	The bag!
XANDER	Come on.... yes!
BUFFY	You really wanna keep this up?
JANITOR	What are you gonna do? Kill us?
CARLOS	Are they gone?
BUFFY	Yeah. Talisman must've been Destroyed.
DAWN	How'd you know it was a talisman?
BUFFY	There's always a talisman.
DAWN	You really weren't kidding about this place. I guess it hasn't changed.
BUFFY	I don't know... it seems smaller.
BUFFY	You guys are gonna be okay. This school is intense, but you can do all right if you're careful. And you might wanna think about sticking together.
KIT	Thank you...
CARLOS	Yeah. I mean it. You're the coolest mom ever.
DAWN	Come on. We've still got a few more classes to live through.
WOOD	Curiouser and curiouser.
BUFFY	What is? You is?
WOOD	Carlos Trejo and Kit Holbern. Possibly the only two students in this school who's files are as thick as yours was.
BUFFY	You really did do your homework.
WOOD	I was looking for one or both of them to implode in a fearsome way before midterms, and you've got 'em socializing, hugging, and if I'm not mistaken, actually headed to class.
BUFFY	Well, we shared an... encounter. Sometimes you just gotta break the ice.
WOOD	You were probably more than happy to get out of this place, but I gotta tell you, Ms. Summers, I think you belong here.
BUFFY	Hamnoo?
WOOD	Ever think about coming back?
BUFFY	Is this that nightmare where I didn't take finals? Should I be in my jammies?
WOOD	I know this school's reputation. You think I got this job 'cause I had seniority? We've got a lot of pretty troubled students here, and just enough money to keep the place from caving in.
BUFFY	You may need a little extra there.
WOOD	We do have a small community outreach program, gets people from the town to teach electives and such... the money we could pay you wouldn't even fold, but it would just be a couple days a week...
BUFFY	You want me to be a counselor?
I	think the kids could use someone, you know, closer to their age, who still --
BUFFY	I'm in.
WOOD	You serious? You heard the part about the money?
BUFFY	I heard. I've been temping, my schedule could be a little funtastic, but I'll work it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.
BUFFY	Just let me know.
GILES	You always will have. That doesn't ever stop.
WILLOW	There's so much I don't understand yet. About control, and, and potions I'm not good with. Plus, many concepts I appeared to understand, I was only nodding and hmmmming in a pretend fashion so as to not look dumb.
GILES	Willow, I understand you're not ready to go back.
WILLOW	Then why are you gonna ask me to?
SPIKE	Everything is... I had a speech, I learned it all... oh God, she won't understand... she won't understand...
WARREN	Of course she won't understand, Sparky. I'm beyond her understanding. She's a girl. Sugar and spice and everything useless unless you're baking. I'm more than that. More than flesh --
GLORY	-- More than blood, I'm... you know, I honestly don't think there's a human word fabulous enough for me. Oh, my name will be on everyone's lips -- assuming their lips haven't been torn off -- but not just yet. That's all right, though...
ADAM	...I can be patient. Everything is well within parameters. She's right where I want her. And so are you, number 17. You're where you belong.
WILKINS	What'd you think, you'd get your soul back and everything would be Jim Dandy? A soul's slipperier than a greased weasel -- why do you think I sold mine? Well, you probably thought you'd be your own man and I respect that. But you never will.
DRUSILIA	You'll always be mine. You'll always be in the dark with me, singing our little songs. You like our little songs, don't you?
MASTER	Right back to the beginning. Not the "Bang", not the "Word", the true beginning. The next few months are going to be quite a ride, and I think we're all gonna learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll learn you're a pathetic shmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already.
BUFFY	It's about power.
DAWN	Well, I've got the stake...
BUFFY	The stake is not the power.
DAWN	But he's new... probably confused, doesn't know what he wants...
VAMPIRE	Blood...
BUFFY	He seems to have some focus there...
DAWN	Yeah, ok, but he doesn't know his strength, he might not know all the fancy martial arts they inevitably seem to pick up...
BUFFY	Who's got the power?
DAWN	He does.
BUFFY	Never forget that. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are, how well armed you are, you're a little girl.
DAWN	Woman.
BUFFY	You're a little woman.
DAWN	I'm taller than you.
BUFFY	He's a vampire . Okay? A demon. Preternaturally strong, skilled, with power that no human can ever --
VAMPIRE	I think I'm stuck.
BUFFY	You're stuck.
VAMPIRE	My foot's caught on a root or something. I don't even know how I got down there... if you girls could just give me a hand...
DAWN	So he's got the power.
BUFFY	Zip it.
BUFFY	Listen up. I'm the Slayer, you don't wanna get into it with me. You want blood, okay? So you can have hers. She's not the Slayer. She's the one to go after. Not me.
VAMPIRE	I was thinking along those lines.
BUFFY	Okay then.
DAWN	Just a scrape. Anyway I had a plan the whole time.
BUFFY	Really.
DAWN	Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire and bite you .
BUFFY	You wanted to be trained...
DAWN	"The Stake is not the power..." Thank you, Master Prada.
BUFFY	Geez, one violent near-death experience and you're suddenly all testy.
DAWN	Just next time you're gonna --
BUFFY	You did pretty well.
DAWN	I did?
BUFFY	Yeah.
DAWN	'Cause with the rolling thing, I was using his strength, it was very tai chi, plus I nearly got the heart --
BUFFY	My first time out I missed the heart too.
DAWN	No way.
BUFFY	Just the once.
DAWN	Well the next vampire I meet --
BUFFY	The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.
DAWN	I know. I just can't believe it's back.
BUFFY	Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few more days 'til it starts -- and then we'll never know what's coming next.
WILLOW	No, it doesn't.
GILES	Passafloracoerulea, native to Paraguay, if my botany serves.
WILLOW	Is there anything you don't know everything about?
GILES	Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me. Other than that, I know all. Yes, Paraguayan. Where did it come from?
WILLOW	Paraguay.
GILES	You brought it through the earth.
WILLOW	It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules, the energy... everything's connected.
GILES	You sound like Ms. Harkness.
GILES	Then why aren't you at your lesson?
WILLOW	I'm sorry.
GILES	It's all right. She was just afraid you --
WILLOW	Had gone evil? Yeah, I was gonna destroy the world, but lunch made me sleepy.
GILES	She didn't think that. She was just --
WILLOW	Afraid. They all are. The Coven is... they're the most amazing women I've ever met. If it wasn't for them, and you... But there's this look they get, like I'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash or something. Which I'm not even sure what that is.
GILES	They're cautious. I trust you can understand that.
WILLOW	I don't have that much power, I don't think. I was... drained by what happened.
GILES	But everything's connected. You're connected to great power, whether you feel it or not.
WILLOW	You should just take it from me.
GILES	You know we can't. This isn't a hobby, or an addiction. It's inside you now, this magic. You're responsible for it.
WILLOW	Will they always be afraid of me?
GILES	Maybe. Can you live with that?
WILLOW	I deserve a lot worse.
GILES	That's not an answer.
WILLOW	I killed people, Giles.
GILES	I've not forgotten.
WILLOW	When you brought me here... I thought it was to kill me. Or lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity, or with the torture... instead, you go all Dumbledore on me, I'm learning about magic, I'm all about energy and gaia and root systems.
GILES	Do you want to be punished?
WILLOW	I wanna be Willow.
GILES	You are. In the end, we are all who we are -- no matter now much we may appear to have changed.
BUFFY	Dawn! Xander's here!
BUFFY	You're gonna be late!
XANDER	Morning --
BUFFY	You gotta eat! I made cereal!
BUFFY	You're unconscionably spiffy.
XANDER	Client meeting. How exactly do you 'make' cereal?
BUFFY	You put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. You want anything?
XANDER	I ate, I'm good. How are you?
BUFFY	My sister's about to go to the same school that tried to kill me for three years. I can't afford private school, I can't change districts, and I can't begin to prepare her for what could come out of there, so peachy with a side of keen, that would be me.
XANDER	Well, here's a little something for what ails you.
BUFFY	You got the rest of it?
XANDER	Take a look.
DAWN	Check out Double-Oh-Xander.
BUFFY	Go talk with your mouth full.
XANDER	I got two crews working this diabolical yet lucrative new campus: finishing up the science building here, and reinforcing the gym. No pentagrams, no secret passageways... everything up to code and safe as houses. I've looked through all the plans, I've been on site after hours...
BUFFY	Nothing's creepy? Strange? From Beyond?
DAWN	Murbee yr paranuhd.
XANDER	Well there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plans for the OLD high school. You remember, the very center of Sunnydale's own hellmouth --
BUFFY	It was under the library.
BUFFY	... the principal's office.
DAWN	So the principal is evil?
BUFFY	Or in a boatload of danger.
XANDER	The last two principals were eaten. Who'd even apply for that gig?
BUFFY	I guess we'll see. Time to head out Got your books? Lunch? Stakes?
DAWN	Check thrice.
XANDER	Did you give her...
BUFFY	Saving it.
DAWN	What is this?
BUFFY	Back to school gift.
DAWN	It's a weapon, isn't it?
BUFFY	Yes it is.
BUFFY	I'm gonna take her to class. Have a look around.
XANDER	Okay. I'll be on site here most of the day, so if you have needs...
BUFFY	Thanks.
DAWN	I got it.
BUFFY	Stay away from hyena people, lizardy- type athletes... if you see anyone invisible --
DAWN	Buffy. I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not gonna see anyone that's invisible.
BUFFY	You could still drop out. Only nerds finish school.
DAWN	I really don't think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my first day of high school, because it is so redundant.
BUFFY	This place is evil.
BUFFY	Oh. Hi.
WOOD	Robin Wood. I'm the new principal.
BUFFY	Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.
WOOD	Nice to meet you.
DAWN	Hi.
BUFFY	So you're the principal. I expected you to be more... aged.
BUFFY	No! Oh. No. Sister.
BUFFY	You didn't really think... Is it my hair? Do I have mom hair?
WOOD	I have actually heard of you, Ms. Summers. You graduated from the old high school, am I right?
BUFFY	Yeah. How did you --
WOOD	Well, I better get to work. Got to start deadening young minds. It was nice to meet you. You have fun.
BUFFY	Well that was suspicious.
DAWN	You betchya. Bye.
BUFFY	Dawn --
DAWN	I know. You never see it coming, the stake is not the power, To Serve Man is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.
ANYA	God, they're depressing.
HALLIE	Who are they kidding with that happy shiny crap?
ANYA	Six weeks, tops, and she's calling on me for vengeance.
HALLIE	Ooh, he'd better run for cover...
ANYA	What's that supposed to mean?
HALLIE	Sweetie, you know exactly what it means. (off her look) You're not keeping your end up!
ANYA	Excuse me?
HALLIE	It's the talk of the Order. They're calling you Ms. Soft-Serve. Tell me you don't know this.
ANYA	I.. Who...
HALLIE	Listen, Anya, I know I've been a little competitive with you, there was that thing during the Crimean War, we laugh about it now, but the fact is I've actually always looked up to you. You were the single most hard-core vengeance demon on the roster and everybody knew it. A woman was wronged, you were on her like icky on poo, granting a wish that was guaranteed to make her ex -- and her -- regret they'd ever heard of romance. Do I have to mention Mrs. Czolgosz?
ANYA	Good times...
HALLIE	You lost your powers -- it happens -- and you fell for this Xander guy.
ANYA	It was a glitch! A summer thing! I'm SO back in the vengeance fold!
HALLIE	Yeah-huh. You're a terror.
ANYA	I've been granting vengeance wishes like a frito bandito and you know it.
HALLIE	No deaths, no eviscerations -- you're not goading women into anything inventive and you're not delivering when it is!
ANYA	I don't even know --
HALLIE	Waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog, you made him French!
ANYA	Well that's a... he's smelly, and with the little mustache...
HALLIE	Anya, if it was just me, I'd say, "fine, she's not about the hard justice..."
ANYA	What do you mean, if it was just you?
HALLIE	D'hoffryn, the lower beings, they're all feeling the heat... something's rising. Something older than the old ones and everybody's tail is twitching. This is a bad time to be a good guy. You haven't felt any of this?
ANYA	I have, I just... I just need to sort things out.
HALLIE	You need to get your vengeance on, doodle-bug. Before they come after you.
ANYA	So, is this an intervention? Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?
BUFFY	Dawn!
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	We gotta go. It's not safe.
DAWN	But...
BUFFY	We, I mean I saw...
TEACHER	Can I help you?
BUFFY	No, I... just I thought you were in danger of, um... smoking, and let's not, kids, 'cause it's not cool to... I'll be around.
XANDER	Tell Ronnie to let the other guys finish upstairs. So, how's it looking? Does the place pass inspection?
BUFFY	It's great, if you're a zombie-ghost- thing.
XANDER	So school's in session, huh?
BUFFY	Seems like old times.
XANDER	S' wonderful.
BUFFY	I'm not sure. They were in the mirror, they disappeared, but they touched me. I think. Let's just start with "dead" and "pissed".
XANDER	They were after you personally?
BUFFY	Talked about protecting people. Told me to leave.
XANDER	No damage, though.
BUFFY	I think I may have destroyed Dawn's social life in all of thirty seconds, but apart from that, no.
BUFFY	I don't know. You could blow up the school again...
XANDER	That never gets old...
BUFFY	It's not a coincidence, you know. The school being rebuilt. It means something... more.
XANDER	As in what?
TEACHER	Are you all right?
DAWN	I'm sorry, I'm sorry... there was a... a bee flew at my eye, I'm very allergic...
TEACHER	I think it's gone...
DAWN	Can I... can I got to the bathroom?
TEACHER	Of course.
WOOD	Whoa.
BUFFY	Sorry.
WOOD	Ms Summers. I didn't know you were still about.
BUFFY	Well, I was looking...
WOOD	I thought generally it was customary for a person who has graduated to, um, go somewhere else.
BUFFY	It's a new campus. I just want to get to know it. Make sure it's all right. For my sister.
DAWN	Hey, what's wrong...
KIT	There's someone... in here...
DAWN	It's only me.
KIT	No. It's not.
WOOD	You know, I actually know a little more about you than I let on before.
BUFFY	Isn't that interesting.
WOOD	It really is.
KIT	Kit.
DAWN	Saw something pretty creepy, huh?
KIT	You won't believe me.
DAWN	I kinda sorta think I will. Was there a pencil involved in any --
GILES	Breathe... just breathe...
WILLOW	Giles... I can't... goddess...
GILES	Just breathe.
WILLOW	What happened?
GILES	What do you remember?
GILES	The Hellmouth.
WILLOW	It's gonna open. It's gonna swallow us all.
KIT	Hey, wake up... please wake up...
DAWN	Oh, God.
KIT	We have to leave.
DAWN	You're not wrong.
KIT	A girl. She said she died here. That everybody dies here and we all would too.
DAWN	And here I was worried about not fitting in.
CARLOS	Who are you?
KIT	Who are you?
DAWN	Are you dead?
CARLOS	Stop saying that!
DAWN	Whoa, Whoa... we're not dead, we saw scary dead people, we're trying to get out of here.
CARLOS	I just came down for a smoke, you know, and I saw... it was the janitor, yelling at me, I thought he was just pissed, but I saw him in the light...
DAWN	You came downstairs. WHERE?
CARLOS	Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl, I don't know this place at all.
DAWN	Okay, so we can run around in circles, or --
JANITOR	You really think you can run away?
KIT	It's not real...
DAWN	Lesson one: It's always real.
NERD	I tried to run, too.
DAWN	Hear me, right... I got a present... my sister gave me a present.
KIT	What is it?
WOOD	The school board recommended I spend some time reading your record. It's a page turner. Kind of a checkered past.
WOOD	Well, your sister clearly looks up to you --
BUFFY	Hey! That's loud.
WOOD	That's part of why we don't allow --
BUFFY	'Scuse me. Uh huh? (to Wood) Sorry. It's my dog. My dog walker. Three dead?
BUFFY	...Yeah...
WOOD	Your dogs are dead?
BUFFY	I'll be right there.
WOOD	Of course... good luck with your... dog tragedy...
JANITOR	Sure as hell didn't save me ...
BUFFY	Where's my sister?
BUFFY	If I'm the one that let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here... What are you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?
NERD	I think I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend...
GIRL	Were you busy making out with your dead boyfriend when I was ripped to death by a werewolf? Is that why you let me die?
NERD	I was screaming for help when they pulled me down into the --
JANITOR	She's not gonna hear you. Place is like a maze, it just swallows up sound.
I	know.
BUFFY	What do you want?
JANITOR	You don't belong here.
GIRL	This place is ours, now. It's built on our graves. We rested easy until we felt you return.
JANITOR	Leave. Leave and never come back.
BUFFY	I'd love to. Really. But --
JANITOR	Dawn is fine. She's sitting in class right now, not remembering any of this. We don't care about her. All we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.
BUFFY	Actually, I think all you want is to get between me and that door.
BUFFY	What? What duck? There's a duck?
BUFFY	They'll probably show up in a sec --
SPIKE	Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.
BUFFY	Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down with some kids --
SPIKE	DON'T YOU THINK I'M TRYING?!? Ooh, not a fast, not a quick STUDY... I dropped my board in the water and the chalk all ran, sure to be caned... ...should've seen that coming...
BUFFY	I'm... where are you?
DAWN	I don't know. A room, by the furnace, near where we fell in.... they dragged us in here then disappeared...
BUFFY	Yeah, they came after me.
SPIKE	Not in here, they'd not dare... no solicitation, thank you...
DAWN	What do they want?
BUFFY	So far, to piss me off.
DAWN	Please tell me it's working.
BUFFY	Oh, I'm damage bound. I just can't figure them -- ghosts can't touch you and zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what we're --
SPIKE	Not ghosts...
BUFFY	Hold on...
BUFFY	Spike, you gonna help me out?
SPIKE	THIS IS MY HOME! I belong here, I've always been here, cheers for stopping by.
BUFFY	I'll get back to you.
CARLOS	I got these...
DAWN	I guess that's better than... ... Kit. Give me your bag.
KIT	Do you think they'll come back?
GIRL	Do you think they'll come back?
KIT	No...
GIRL	Why do you think we picked you? The ones no one will miss... the ones that don't belong... Spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll never ever leave.
DAWN	Thanks, sis.
BUFFY	We just gotta hold 'em at bay --
BUFFY	You really wanna keep this up?
JANITOR	What are you gonna do? Kill us?
CARLOS	Are they gone?
BUFFY	Yeah. Talisman must've been Destroyed.
DAWN	How'd you know it was a talisman?
DAWN	You really weren't kidding about this place. I guess it hasn't changed.
BUFFY	I don't know... it seems smaller.
BUFFY	You guys are gonna be okay. This school is intense, but you can do all right if you're careful. And you might wanna think about sticking together.
KIT	Thank you...
WOOD	Curiouser and curiouser.
BUFFY	What is? You is?
WOOD	Carlos Trejo and Kit Holbern. Possibly the only two students in this school who's files are as thick as yours was.
BUFFY	You really did do your homework.
WOOD	I was looking for one or both of them to implode in a fearsome way before midterms, and you've got 'em socializing, hugging, and if I'm not mistaken, actually headed to class.
BUFFY	Well, we shared an... encounter. Sometimes you just gotta break the ice.
WOOD	You were probably more than happy to get out of this place, but I gotta tell you, Ms. Summers, I think you belong here.
BUFFY	Hamnoo?
WOOD	Ever think about coming back?
BUFFY	Is this that nightmare where I didn't take finals? Should I be in my jammies?
WOOD	I know this school's reputation. You think I got this job 'cause I had seniority? We've got a lot of pretty troubled students here, and just enough money to keep the place from caving in.
BUFFY	You may need a little extra there.
WOOD	We do have a small community outreach program, gets people from the town to teach electives and such... the money we could pay you wouldn't even fold, but it would just be a couple days a week...
BUFFY	You want me to be a counselor?
I	think the kids could use someone, you know, closer to their age, who still --
BUFFY	I'm in.
WOOD	You serious? You heard the part about the money?
BUFFY	I heard. I've been temping, my schedule could be a little funtastic, but I'll work it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.
BUFFY	Just let me know.
GILES	You always will have. That doesn't ever stop.
WILLOW	There's so much I don't understand yet. About control, and, and potions I'm not good with. Plus, many concepts I appeared to understand, I was only nodding and hmmmming in a pretend fashion so as to not look dumb.
GILES	Willow, I understand you're not ready to go back.
WILLOW	Then why are you gonna ask me to?

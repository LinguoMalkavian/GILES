XANDER	I get Warren being a supervillainy type. But I thought Jonathan completely learned that lesson. And I never even heard of this other guy.
WILLOW	You shoulda seen their headquarters, it was like, the nerd natural habitat.
ANYA	We know where they are? Shouldn't we do something?
WILLOW	We tried. Buffy was gonna go in there and bust 'em on the spot.
XANDER	I'm sensing a not so completely.
WILLOW	Yeah, She went in there, but --
ANYA	Speaking of Buffy isn't she ready? She's gonna be late for her first day.
WILLOW	Hey, respect the narrative flow much?
ANYA	Please, continue the story of failure.
WILLOW	Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out. She brought back what was left, spell books and parchments.
XANDER	Ooh. I mean, pff, nerds.
ANYA	Okay, ya know what? This is why demons are better than people.
WILLOW	Interesting turn.
ANYA	When I was a vengeance demon, I caused pain and Mayhem, certainly, but I put in a very full day's work doing it! And I got compensated appropriately!
XANDER	(to Willow) Welcome to today's episode of "Go Money Go." I hear it every day.
WILLOW	Right. For the rest of your life.
ANYA	But supervillains want reward without labor! To make things come easy. It's wrong! Without labor there can be no payment and vice versa! The country cannot progress! Workers are the tools that shape America!
BUFFY	I was kinda feeling like a tool and now I know why.
NARRATOR	Because you've just become Part Of the Doublemeat Experience!
TEEN	I'm a part of it!
TYPE	I'm a part of it!
MAN	I'm a part of it, too!
BUFFY	Holy crap.
MANNY	Interesting, isn't it?
BUFFY	Uh, yeah. The cow and chicken coming together even though they never met... It was like Sleepless in Seattle if Tom and Meg were, like, minced.
MANNY	Okay... I'm Manny, the Manager. It's not a joke, it's just my name.
BUFFY	Right, you mentioned that a couple times when I filled out the application.
MANNY	Why do you want to work here, Buffy? You seem like a sharp young woman, and there are a lot of other jobs.
BUFFY	Well, I need money pretty quickly so I didn't want to go through a whole big interview process. I'm supporting my younger sister and we've had some expenses-
MANNY	You have motivation, don't you? You're a motivated worker.
BUFFY	I guess.
MANNY	C'mon. Let's give you a tour.
MANNY	You can take breaks in here. But if you're eating, do it out front. We want people to see we eat our food.
BUFFY	But if I brought something from home, I could eat it here?
MANNY	You'll be eating our food. Phillip, Timothy, this is Buffy She's gonna work the counter.
PHILLIP	What happened to the other one? Catherine.
MANNY	Emily?
PHILLIP	Yeah.
TIMOTHY	She's gone.
BUFFY	What happened?
TIMOTHY	Whatever always happens.
MANNY	You can use this one.
BUFFY	There's someone's stuff.
MANNY	They must have left it. You can toss it or keep what you want. Don't worry about it.
BUFFY	Sure they're not coming back? They're not getting far naked!
MANNY	We have a lot of turnover here. By the way, we all share this room, so put up a sign when you're changing. That's what a lady does.
BUFFY	(genuinely confused) Are they going to do something?
MANNY	They're solid. Follow their example and you won't go wrong. They're lifers.
BUFFY	Lifers?
MANNY	In it for life. Like me. You want to get something out of this, Buffy, you'll do the same. You put in the work and ten years from now, you'll be where I am, I promise you.
MANNY	This is the kitchen. The beating heart of the Doublemeat Palace.
BUFFY	Wow. They're all so identical.
MANNY	Yeah, they all start to look the same to me, too.
BUFFY	Not the employees. I meant the chicken slices.
MANNY	Drive-thru station's over there. High-pressure job. You won't need to go in there. Over there's the grill, the fryers, the walk-in freezer -- you don't need to go in there either -- the dehydrated pickle storage --
BUFFY	What's in here?
MANNY	Those are locked. Now, I want to show you this. Look.
BUFFY	Yeah, I know the Medley. But the video was kinda... graphic with the slaughter--
MANNY	A classic double-decker with a twist. A pure beefy patty above the mid-bun and a slice of processed chicken product below the mid-bun. Plus pickles and the secret ingredient. Eat it.
BUFFY	Well, I had a big breakfast... But it smells so...
MANNY	It's a meat process. Now I think it's time to start earning your money, don't you, Buffy?
BUFFY	So what's the deal with Manny the Manager? And if I ask him nice, can I write a children's book called that?
GARY	Fill this while I get the fries.
BUFFY	Fill this? I didn't know there was gonna be drug-testing.
GARY	You're funny! You better stop that.
BUFFY	What? Why?
GARY	Productivity. One of Manny's watchwords. "Levity is a time-thief that picks the pocket of the company."
BUFFY	I prefer the one that goes "Manny's a humorless dolt that picks the pocket of he should bite me."
GARY	You really better be quiet with that.
LADY	I'd like a small coffee and a cherry pie.
GARY	That's a dollar ninety-two, ma'am.
BUFFY	You hit so many buttons. It was like... buttonpalooza...
GARY	No, it's easy. Look, there's pictures of the food on the buttons. I hit the "coffee" button, then I hit the "small" button. Then "cherry pie" -- there's a picture of a little fried pie.
BUFFY	Ahh.
GARY	Then I hit the "total" button. Then I put the money in the drawer, close it, and it resets the system. A cocker spaniel could do it. Here, you take the next one, the family. They're regulars.
BUFFY	Hi. I'm new.
LADY	I come here every day.
BUFFY	That's nice.
LADY	You might just make it, dear. Not like some of them, where suddenly you never see them again. I could see you being here a long time.
BUFFY	Oh... good.
LADY	Thank you.
BUFFY	Welcome to the Doublemeat Palace. May I help you?
TYPICAL	Yeah. We need two number 4 Medley Meals, a junior Medley, a Fisherman's Medley with bacon, and a kid's meal. Pius three fries, a chocolatey shake and extra pickles on one of the Medleys.
BUFFY	I'm sorry. This button. Does it look chocolatey to you?
MANNY	You don't need to be in there.
BUFFY	Sorry, I was curious.
MANNY	Curiosity killed the cat.
BUFFY	Theory number five: cat-burgers.
DAWN	Hey Buffy!
XANDER	We were gonna all yell "good luck on the new job," but we don't have the timing that kind of thing requires.
ANYA	We're here to support your subsistence-level employment! Bravo.
BUFFY	Wow, thanks! This is so cool of you.
WILLOW	Dawny, you want a burger or anything? I could get you whatever you want.
DAWN	That's okay. I don't need anything. I'm just here for Buffy.
XANDER	So, Buff, how's it going?
BUFFY	I don't know. I've waitressed before, but this is different.
DAWN	When were you a waitress?
BUFFY	Oh. In L.A., that summer. It was a diner, and we had, you know, people who didn't tip, and lots of funny, funny health code violations, but it wasn't like this. There's something wrong here. Will? You okay?
WILLOW	Oh, sorry, just, but I was listening. Something wrong.
BUFFY	The manager's all like, mysterious and scary. And there's this secret ingredient, and the people that work here are strange. They sort of, tare into space, plus they disappear...
ANYA	Disappear poof?
BUFFY	Not poof. Well, I don't think so.
XANDER	It's fast food. I have swum in these murky waters, my friend. There is assorted creepiness, there is staring, there is the enthusiastic not-showing-up-at-all I think you're seeing demons where there's just, life.
BUFFY	I didn't say "demons." I'm just saying there's a vibe. You haven't seen this manager.
ANYA	Isn't that him over there? Getting the pickles wet?
XANDER	Yeah, with the wing-tips.
WLLLOW	And the glasses.
DAWN	He looks like my principal. Ooh. Can my principal be a demon too?
BUFFY	Again, I never actually said "demons." Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's just the video that's creeping me out. The cow and the chicken all swirly together...
XANDER	Make me hungry, why don't you? How about one of those delicious Medley meals?
BUFFY	Cool. You got it. On me.
XANDER	Hey, thanks!
DAWN	And getting a free meal.
XANDER	Well, yeah.
ANYA	Do you like this food, honey? Maybe we should have it at the reception.
DAWN	You're serving burgers? Cool.
ANYA	Well, time is getting very short. After Willow did the, whoosh, instant engagement party, I got slack on the planning, cuz I figured she'd help. But now that's all blown to hell.
WILLOW	Standing right here. Standing right exactly here.
ANYA	Sorry, didn't mean to tempt you. Everyone's so delicate. Anyway, I still have to select the bridesmaid dresses, plus there's the out-of-town guests and the ones from the demon realm. You wouldn't believe how many of them are not letting us know either way.
BUFFY	Here you go. One Medley Meal. Plus I doublesized your fries...
XANDER	Kmmmph?
BUFFY	I'm probably kidding.
BUFFY	Slow night.
GINA	We're not allowed. Down time robs us all.
BUFFY	Thus quoth Manny. But, thing is, there's no one here!
GINA	Sure there is, look.
BUFFY	Oh, this'll make the day complete.
SPIKE	What's in the Doublemeat Nuggets?
BUFFY	Go away. I'm working.
SPIKE	Yeah, and you chose to be in a consumer service profession. I'm a consumer. Service me.
BUFFY	Order something or go.
SPIKE	Give a bloke a chance for his eyes to adjust. Damn fluorescent lights. Plus they make me look dead...
BUFFY	I'm not a demon. I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
SPIKE	Oh, I see. That why you took this job? Prove something to yourself? A normal job for a normal girl. Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is.
BUFFY	I'll be fine.
SPIKE	Buffy.
BUFFY	Please don't make this any harder.
SPIKE	You don't belong here. You're something... You're better than this.
BUFFY	I need the money.
SPIKE	I can get money. Walk away with me now. C'mon. I'll bet you can think of things we could be doing, lots nicer'n standing here...
BUFFY	Yeah...
SPIKE	You gotta get out of here. This place'll do stuff to you.
GARY	Someone there?
BUFFY	Feels like I just left, ya know?
TIMOTHY	You came back.
BUFFY	(wishing she hadn't) Yeah, I came back.
MANNY	Gary's gone.
BUFFY	Gary? The counter guy that helped me out? What do you mean?
MANNY	He didn't show up this morning.
BUFFY	But the shift is just starting.
MANNY	He was supposed to unlock early this morning. Didn't show. Pull his card.
BUFFY	He must just be late. He didn't seem like he was going anywhere.
MANNY	I'm moving Timothy to counter. You're on grill.
BUFFY	Me?
MANNY	I've been watching you.
BUFFY	But I don't know how to grill.
MANNY	Just think. This is the last day you'll ever be able to say that.
PHILLIP	You put the beef on the grill. You hit the button. Then it beeps. You flip the beef and hit this other button. Then it beeps. You put it on the bun. There's not a button for that. Then you put more beef on the grill.
BUFFY	Repeat until insane.
PHILLIP	It eliminates variation. Every burger at every Doublemeat Palace is the same. People don't like variation.
BUFFY	Got it. Variety is the spice of Bad.
BUFFY	What's the secret ingredient?
PHILLIP	It's a meat process.
BUFFY	What does that mean?
PHILLIP	It's a process. That they do to the meat.
BUFFY	But what is it?
PHILLIP	It's just the name of the process.
BUFFY	(as if it makes sense) Ohhh.
PHILLIP	Skin, hair, eyelashes, nostrils. Inside your ears.
BUFFY	Um, that's okay.
PHILLIP	Once I noticed I couldn't hear and I went to this doctor and he said it was the grease. It made a plug.
BUFFY	Oh.
PHILLIP	Now I have a kit. For ear cleaning. It has this bulb mechanism.
BUFFY	Imagine that
BUFFY	Yay, it's Manny.
MANNY	You're working a double-shift.
BUFFY	What? Another eight hours? Right after these eight hours? That's... so many hours.
MANNY	You get paid for it. Plus an extra free Doublemeat Medley. Remember, eat it out front.
BUFFY	Um... what happened? Why the double shiftiness?
MANNY	Gary never showed. And now one of my grinder guys is late too.
BUFFY	But they could still show up, right? I mean, they could be anywhere.
TIMOTHY	New meat's here.
XANDER	Ahn? That was Buffy. She's working late, so I might hafta go--
HALFREK	I have been called and vengeance shall I wreak! Cower, masculine one. Tremble as you face my wrath!
ANYA	Xander? I'm starting to think we should do this pot-luck style --
XANDER	Honey?
ANYA	Yeee!
HALFREK	Hello. I am here to tear this man apart. How many pieces do you wish?
ANYA	Halfrek?
HALFREK	Anyanka?
ANYA	Hallie! I can't believe it!
XANDER	You two... you know each other...
ANYA	Funny Halfrek, I didn't Summon you to kill Xander! I called to invite you to our wedding!
HALFREK	You -- Oh my. What an embarrassing mistake!
XANDER	Wow. Um... you guys clearly have catching up to do, so I'll... I'll be not in the apartment --
ANYA	Gosh, it's swell to see you again, Hallie!. I didn't mean for you to have to materialize all the way out here! Not 'til the ceremony, I mean!
HALFREK	I guess the message got garbled. You know how it is, half the time I have no idea if I'm maiming the right guy. So. . . you are marrying that man with the large upper arms?
ANYA	Yes.
HALFREK	Why?
ANYA	Because I love him.
HALFREK	Hmmm.
ANYA	And we'll be very happy together.
HALFREK	Hmmm.
ANYA	What?
TIMOTHY	Sometimes it does that. They say bugs fall in there.
WILLOW	C'min.
AMY	It's me. Dawn said I could come up. Is she pissed at you too, or just at me? What did you tell her about me?
WILLOW	Do you need something?
AMY	Um, yeah, actually. I mean, I don't know if you wanted to keep it... or...
WILLOW	You want it? Really?
AMY	Well, you know, it's not much, but it's home. Or it was. I dunno, I guess it's stupid, but...
WILLOW	It's not stupid. You can have it, of course.
AMY	Hey, I heard you've got this whole cold turkey thing going on. How's that going?
WILLOW	It's good. Really good. It was hard there for a while. Frustrating, you know, having to do everything the slow way. It was like, is everything gonna take forever... forever?
AMY	Yeah.
WILLOW	But it's better now. I'm getting my focus back.
AMY	Mm. I can see that.
WILLOW	It's a pivotal page.
AMY	So this is it, huh? This is gonna be your life from now on?
WILLOW	What? No.
AMY	But you're never gonna do it again. Ever. You're never gonna feel how it made you feel...
WILLOW	Don't think that's the way to look at it.
AMY	Hey, Will. It's your birthday.
WILLOW	Um, no, it's not. Although now that you mention it, Buffy's is next--
AMY	(in Latin) Power.
WILLOW	Amy? Wh-- Uhhhn.
AMY	It's a gift. It's magic and it didn't come from you. It came from me. Completely legal. Enjoy.
BUFFY	Look! This was under the grinder!
MANNY	Oh my God.
BUFFY	You wanna tell me what's going on?
MANNY	I'm not sure.
BUFFY	Try again.
MANNY	Well, there was an accident, maybe, six weeks ago, a grinder incident, but no one reported any unrecovered --
BUFFY	This isn't six weeks old. This is new!
MANNY	It is? Oh, maybe Gary did come in this morning, or, I don't know, late last night. Maybe there was an accident and he got himself to the hospital --
BUFFY	Right. Maybe Gary's in the hospital. Or maybe he's in the grinder! Huh? "Meat process"?! "Secret Ingredient'?! Maybe he's on the grill! Maybe he's under the pickle chips!
MANNY	Buffy?
BUFFY	Stop eating! No! Stop!
BUFFY	It's people! The Doublemeat Medley is people!!!!
LADY	What about the cherry pie?
MANNY	What are you doing? I thought you were on the team!
HALFREK	Tell me more about Xander.
ANYA	Why do you keep asking about him? Do you think I'm making a mistake?
HALFREK	Do you?
ANYA	No! Xander, he's very kind. And brave. He has the sweetest smile and the nicest body. And he loves me. Sometimes that isn't easy, but he does.
HALFREK	Who told you it isn't easy to love you?
ANYA	Well, I do something, or say something, and then he has to say stuff like, "it is incorrect to appreciate money so rnuch" or "observe, here is how a real human would have acted".
HALFREK	So he corrects you.
ANYA	Well, it's just... I'm all confused now. Do you think there's something wrong with how he treats me?
HALFREK	Do you?
ANYA	Okay, you have to stop doing that. I love Xander.
HAL	Even though he thinks he knows better than you.
ANYA	He doesn't. He doesn't think that.
HALFREK	Sorry. I'm just curious. You don't have to say any more about him if you're not comfortable.
ANYA	But I am! I mean, it's not like I'm hiding deficiencies or anything.
XANDER	... Go fish.
BUFFY	I call an emergency meeting and this is it? Where's Willow? Where's Anya?
DAWN	I couldn't find Willow. I knocked and knocked on her door.
XANDER	Anya's entertaining a vengeance demon named Hallie. Say, Buff, did you ever see what Anya looked like as a demon? Because, if it was that, wow.
BUFFY	There's something wrong at the Doublemeat Palace. Really wrong.
DAWN	Have you been demon-fighting? Is that why you smell funny?
BUFFY	No, I'm talking about-- I smell funny?
DAWN	Ewww! (then, interested) Whose is it?
BUFFY	I'm not certain. It might be this nice guy named Gary, only one there who didn't seem all brain-dead. He didn't show up this morning. Except now I think he was there the whole time. As the secret ingredient. We have to analyze that burger, find out if it used to be people--
XANDER	(mouth full) Whatph?
BUFFY	Xander! You ate it?
XANDER	Okay, first you say it's cat. Then, you come in, hand me a burger, blah blah, five minutes later, oh by the way that's hot delicious human flesh!
BUFFY	We were supposed to analyze that! I can't just go back there and get another!
XANDER	That's your problem with this scenario? How to get seconds?!
WILLOW	Late! Late! Sorry! I was just, I was reading for school. Highlighting. Anyway late.
XANDER	Yeth. You jutht mithed the Garyburger.
WILLOW	What're we doing? Let's jump right in. Did Xander say there was food?
DAWN	You wouldn't want it. Apparently the Doublemeat Medley is people.
XANDER	Gah.
WILLOW	Whoa. Bad.
BUFFY	I bet it's not just this one time, or even this one town. There are Doublemeat Palaces all over California.
DAWN	I've eaten there a lot.
BUFFY	We all have. Everyone has. They've got the perfect deal. Everyone expects high turnover of the employees, the meat costs them nothing and... and... They've got us disposing of the bodies! How sick is that? We gotta take down the whole company. Willow, Xander ate the burger. Can you still figure out for sure what it was?
WILLOW	I... Yeah, I can, uh, I can get right on analyzing that. With science. Not... I can use science. You ate it?
DAWN	We have the wrapper. There's little shribbles of meat on the wrapper.
XANDER	Gah.
BUFFY	You guys work on that. I'm going back. It's after closing now, I can sneak around, see what I find.
WILLOW	Cool! You go. We'll be good.
DAWN	Are you all right?
WILLOW	I'm just, I'm worried about Buffy She could be walking into anything.
BUFFY	Manny?
WILLOW	Don't need magic. Don't need it, don't need it...
DAWN	My friend Janice? Her sister's a lawyer.
XANDER	You think I should sue over the burger? That's interesting.
DAWN	No. I just mean, Buffy's never gonna be a lawyer. Or a doctor. Anything big.
XANDER	She's the Slayer. She saves the whole world. That's way bigger.
DAWN	But it means she's gonna have, like, crap jobs her whole life, right? Minimum wage stuff. I mean, I could still grow up to be anything, but for her, this is it.
XANDER	Okay, but maybe you'll be a lawyer or doctor and you can use your money to support your deadbeat sister!
DAWN	Oh, that's terrifically better. Thanks.
WILLOW	Hey, guys. I think I've got it!
XANDER	Good job, Will! Now, these aren't, like, potions, are they?
WILLOW	No! No potions! It's not magic. It's chemistry. You can tell by how damn slow it is. I made a solution that reacts to the proteins in human blood. We're pretty close to knowing for certain.
ANYA	I'm here! I'm here!
DAWN	We're doing chemistry.
ANYA	Oh. I'm so sorry I hurried.
XANDER	Did your friend have a good time? And then leave?
ANYA	She's gone.
XANDER	Hey, Ahn? The way she looked... with the... face... that wasn't what you... used to look like, was it?
ANYA	Is there something wrong with that? Did you think she was unattractive?
XANDER	Okay, is there an answer to that that won't make you nuts?
ANYA	Halfrek was always considered a great beauty.
XANDER	Well, hun, she was a little... there was some veiny-ness...
WILLOW	Xander, hold this for me.
I	mean, I'll be able to look through the microscope and then I can see it.
DAWN	So much suspense. It's like taking a pregnancy test. When they do that in the pregnancy test commercials.
ANYA	It's not like you're so perfect either with your strangely large upper arms and tendency to criticize.
XANDER	Huh?
DAWN	What do you see?
WILLOW	There's no reaction...
XANDER	Oh God no! No reaction!
WILLOW	...which means it's not human.
XANDER	It's not human! It's not human?
ANYA	Is it demon meat? Maybe someone is killing demons and using them as a cheap source of meat. We've all heard of that. And, by the way, I disapprove of demon meat no matter how much money it saves. Does that surprise you?
XANDER	Again I say, huh?
WILLOW	Hm.
DAWN	Demon meat?
WILLOW	No... but... I'm not sure what I'm seeing. Cellulose?
BUFFY	Scalp!
LADY	Oh dear. Wig lady? Is that what they call me? I don't care for that.
LADY	The paralysis spreads upwards, by the way. You may want to flail your arms while you still can. Did I tell you you're my favorite? Not you, personally. Nothing special about you. Doublemeat Workers.
LADY	Only thing is, you tend to run away. And I've slowed down over the years...
I	simply love the paralysis. It means I can eat you slowly. It's better for the digestion.
WILLOW	Are you in there, Buffy? I can't see you inside.
WILLOW	Buffy... there's more. Something Happened today. I didn't do it. Amy did it. But I feel so bad about it...
I	couldn't stop it. And now it's gone and I'm kinda shaky and it really feels like I need it, Buffy...
WILLOW	Buffy!
LADY	Visitors. How nice.
WILLOW	Missed me.
BUFFY	Para... paralyzed. I think... it's wearing off.
WILLOW	I got it, Buffy! I killed it! Look!
WILLOW	Ewwww.
AMY	Hey.
WILLOW	Amy.
AMY	Can I come in? My new place isn't set up yet, and I wanted to borrow some stuff, like, detergent--
WILLOW	You really can't.
AMY	I can't borrow detergent? Well, when they start calling me stinky Amy, I'll say, hey, not my fault--
WILLOW	I can't spend time with you anymore.
AMY	What?
WILLOW	You can't come in here again.
AMY	What's up? You didn't like your birthday present?
WILLOW	That's right.
AMY	You're telling me you didn't have a genuine blast? Come on, that was a sweet spell, trip to Disneyland without the lines.
WILLOW	You don't get it. What you did to me was wrong. You dosed me, Amy. Do you have any idea how much harder that makes, just, everything?
AMY	Know what I notice? You're not denying you had fun.
WILLOW	Shut up.
AMY	Oh, yeah. Sharp argument you got there. Were you on the debate team? I forget. I forgot a lot while you were failing to make me be not a rat.
WILLOW	Amy. If you really are my friend, you better stay away from me. And if you really aren't... You better stay away from me.
BUFFY	Oh. Hi... You must be the new manager. I'm Buffy Summers.
LORRAINE	I'm Lorraine Ross. They called me in when Manny did his disappearing act. You hear about that? Guy just disappeared.
BUFFY	Yeah, I think... I think that used to happen here a lot.
LORRAINE	Buffy Summers. I heard about you. Caused a big scene.
BUFFY	Um, yeah. Practical jokes not really right for the workplace. I so get that now. Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform. It got, it's kinda torn.
LORRAINE	Most people don't even bother.
BUFFY	The Doublemeat Medley is vegetables.
LORRAINE	How do you know that?
BUFFY	So I guess it's true.
LORRAINE	It's a formed and texturized vegetable based meat-like product, suitable for grinding. It's blended with large amounts of rendered beef fat for flavor.
BUFFY	Wait. The secret ingredient in your beef is... beef?
LORRAINE	Buffy. You know something powerful here, do you understand that? The Doublemeat reputation is built on a foundation of meat. You can't spread this around.
BUFFY	Um... yeah. I get that. It is a valuable secret, isn't it?
LORRAINE	Is there something you want?
BUFFY	I really need money.
LORRAINE	You want money?
BUFFY	No! Well, yes. I mean, I want to work. I have zero money coming in, and I'd really like, I'd like to not be fired anymore.
LORRAINE	I don't want any more practical jokes. I mean it.
BUFFY	I promise.
LORRAINE	Well I'm really short-handed right now. And you're already trained... I think you can not be fired.
BUFFY	That's, that's great. And I can do the job, I promise that too.
LORRAINE	I certainly hope so. I don't like short-timers, Buffy. I like people who want to be here. Maybe you didn't take this job seriously before, but from now on.
BUFFY	Right. Here on out.

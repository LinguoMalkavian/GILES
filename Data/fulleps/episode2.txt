WILLOW	No! Nooo! Get -- off --
WILLOW	Xander, are you okay?
XANDER	Man... something hit me...
BUFFY	Where's Jesse?
WILLOW	I don't know -- they surrounded us -- he was really weak...
XANDER	That girl grabbed him. Took off.
BUFFY	Which way?
XANDER	I don't know.
BUFFY	Jesse... BLACK OUT.
GILES	In time they lost their purchase on this reality, and the way was made for the mortal animals. For Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges: Certain magicks, certain creatures...
BUFFY	And vampires...
XANDER	Okay, this is where I have a problem, see, because we're now talking about vampires. We're having a talk with vampires in it.
WILLOW	Oooh... I need to sit down.
BUFFY	You are sitting down.
WILLOW	Oh. Good for me.
XANDER	So vampires are demons?
GILES	The books tell that the last Demon to leave this reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He was a human form possessed -- infected -- by the Demon's soul. He bit another, and another... and so they walk the earth, feeding. Killing some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out, and the Old Ones to return.
MASTER	Is this for me?
LUKE	An offering, Master.
DARLA	He's a good one. His blood is pure.
MASTER	You've tasted it.
MASTER	I'm your faithful dog. You bring me scraps.
DARLA	I didn't mean to --
DARLA	Master, forgive me. We had more offerings but there was trouble. A girl.
LUKE	There was a girl. She fought well, and she knew of our breed. It's possible that she may be...
MASTER	A Slayer? SMASH CUT TO:
XANDER	And that would be a what?
GILES	As long as there have been vampires, there has been the Slayer. One girl in all the world --
BUFFY	He loves doing this part.
GILES	All right: They hunt vampires, one Slayer dies, the next is called, Buffy is the Slayer, don't tell anyone. I think that's all the vampire information you need.
XANDER	Except for one thing. How do you kill them?
BUFFY	You don't. I do.
XANDER	Well, Jesse --
BUFFY	Jesse's my responsibility. I let him get taken.
XANDER	That's not true.
WILLOW	If you hadn't showed up, they would have... taken us too... Does anybody mind if I pass out.
BUFFY	Breathe...
WILLOW	Breathe.
BUFFY	Breathe. This big guy, Luke, he talked about an offering to the Master. I don't know who or what, but if they weren't just feeding, Jesse may still be alive. I'm gonna find him.
WILLOW	This is probably the dumb question, but shouldn't we call the police?
GILES	Do you think they'd believe us?
WILLOW	We don't have to say vampires. We could say there was... a bad man.
BUFFY	They couldn't handle it if they did come. They'd only show up with guns.
GILES	You've no idea where they took Jesse?
BUFFY	I looked around, but... soon as they got clear of the woods they could have just --whoom.
XANDER	They can fly ?
BUFFY	They can drive.
XANDER	Oh.
WILLOW	I don't remember hearing a car...
GILES	Well, let's take an enormous intuitive leap and say they went underground.
BUFFY	Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get anywhere in town without catching any rays. I didn't see any access around there, though.
XANDER	Well, there's electrical tunnels. They run under the whole town.
GILES	If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it might indicate a meeting place. I suppose we could go to the building commission --
BUFFY	We so don't have time.
WILLOW	Uh, guys? There may be another way.
MASTER	A Slayer... Have you any proof?
LUKE	Only that she fought me and yet lives.
MASTER	Very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the last time that happened.
LUKE	1843, in Madrid. And the bastard caught me sleeping.
MASTER	She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the Harvest.
LUKE	I would never let that happen.
MASTER	You needn't worry. I believe she'll come to us. We have something that she wants. If she is a Slayer, and this boy lives, she'll try to save him.
LUKE	I thought you nothing more than a meal, boy. Congratulations. You've just been upgraded to "bait". CUT TO:
WILLOW	This runs under the graveyard.
XANDER	I don't see any access.
GILES	So all the city plans are just open to the public?
WILLOW	Uh, well, in a way. I sort of stumbled onto them when I accidentally... decrypted the city council's security system.
XANDER	Someone's been naughty...
BUFFY	There's nothing here. This is useless!
GILES	I think you should ease up on yourself.
XANDER	What?
BUFFY	He didn't come out of nowhere. He came from behind me. I was facing the entrance. He came from behind me and he didn't follow me out. The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum.
GILES	Are you sure?
BUFFY	The girl must have doubled back with Jesse after I got out. God, I'm so mentally challenged!
XANDER	So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?
BUFFY	There's no 'we'. Okay? I'm the Slayer, and you're not.
XANDER	I knew you were gonna throw that in my face.
BUFFY	Xander, this is deeply dangerous.
XANDER	I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.
WILLOW	Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place full of monsters, but I do want to help. I need to.
GILES	Then help me. I've been researching this Harvest affair. Seems to be some sort of pre-ordained massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on earth... Quite charmless. I am fuzzy on the details, however, and it may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine. That was a bit British, wasn't it?
BUFFY	Welcome to the new world.
GILES	I want you to go on the Net.
WILLOW	Oh! Yeah. Sure. I can do that.
BUFFY	Then I'm out of here. If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.
GILES	Do I have to tell you to be careful?
FLUTIE	And where do we think we're going?
BUFFY	We? I? Me?
BUFFY	No! I'm just ... admiring the fence. This is quality fencework.
FLUTIE	Because if we were leaving school grounds on our second day at a new school after being kicked out of our old school for delinquent behavior -- do you see where I'm going with this?
BUFFY	Mr. Giles!
FLUTIE	What?
BUFFY	He asked me to get a book for him. From the store 'cause I have a free period and I'm a big reader did it mention that on my transcripts?
FLUTIE	Mr. Giles.
BUFFY	Ask him.
FLUTIE	Well, maybe that's how they do things in Britain, they've got that royal family and all kinds of problems. But here at Sunnydale nobody leaves campus while school's in session. Are we clear?
BUFFY	We're clear.
FLUTIE	That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school. The sensible girl, with her feet on the ground.
BUFFY	I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
ANGEL	They really don't like me dropping in.
BUFFY	Why not?
ANGEL	They really don't like me.
BUFFY	How could that possibly be?
ANGEL	I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner or later. Actually, I thought it was gonna be a little sooner.
BUFFY	I'm sorry you had to wait. Look, if you're gonna be popping up with this cryptic wise man act on a regular basis, can you at least tell me your name?
ANGEL	Angel.
BUFFY	Angel. It's a pretty name.
ANGEL	Don't go down there.
BUFFY	Deal with my going.
ANGEL	You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk. Tonight is the Harvest. Unless you can prevent it, the Master walks.
BUFFY	If this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why don't you stop it?
ANGEL	Because I'm afraid.
ANGEL	They'll be expecting you.
BUFFY	I've got a friend down there -- or, a potential friend. Do you know what it's like to have a friend?
BUFFY	That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.
ANGEL	When you hit the tunnels, head east, toward the school. That's where you're likely to find them.
BUFFY	You gonna wish me luck?
ANGEL	Good luck. BLACK OUT.
XANDER	Did you see anything?
BUFFY	Xander! What are you doing here?
XANDER	Something stupid. I followed you. I couldn't just sit around not doing anything.
BUFFY	I understand. Now go away.
XANDER	Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him, then that's what I gotta do.
XANDER	Besides, it's this or Chem class.
GILES	"For they will gather, and be gathered. All that is theirs shall be his... From the Vessel pours life." Pours life...
GILES	"On the night of the crescent moon, the first past the solstice, it will come." Of course. Tonight. CUT TO:
CORDELIA	No! It's suppose to find the syntax and match it. Or, wait...
HARMONY	Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
CORDELIA	No, we're going to the other cool place in Sunnydale.
CORDELIA	Of course we're going to the Bronze! Friday night, no cover. But you should have been there last night.
HARMONY	I think we did this part wrong.
CORDELIA	Why do we have to devise these programs? Isn't that what nerds are for? What did she do?
HARMONY	Uh, she's doing something else.
XANDER	Okay, so: crosses, garlic, stake through the heart.
BUFFY	That'll get it done.
XANDER	Cool. Of course, I don't actually have any of those things.
BUFFY	Good thinking.
XANDER	Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to come down here. I brought this, though.
BUFFY	Turn that off!
XANDER	Okay, okay. So, what else?
BUFFY	What else what?
XANDER	For Vampire Slayage.
XANDER	So you've done some beheading in your time.
BUFFY	Oh, yeah. There was this one time, I was pinned down by this vampire, he played left tackle for the varsity -- I mean, before he was... well anyway he's got one of those really thick necks and all I've got is a little Exacto knife -- You're not loving this story.
XANDER	Actually, I find it oddly comforting.
CORDELIA	Okay, and then "Pattern Run" right? Or "Go To End". That's it.
HARMONY	Maybe... I think...
CORDELIA	Well, what does the book say? So anyway, I come out of the bathroom and she comes running at me with a stick, screaming, "I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!" I swear.
GUY	Who?
CORDELIA	Buffy.
HARMONY	The new girl.
GUY	What's her deal?
CORDELIA	She's crazed!
HARMONY	Did you hear about her old school? Booted.
CORDELIA	I exhibit no surprise.
GUY	Why was she kicked out?
CORDELIA	'Cause she's a psycho-loony.
WILLOW	No, she's not.
CORDELIA	What?
WILLOW	She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.
CORDELIA	Excuse me? Who gave you permission to exist? Do I horn in on your private discussions? No. Why? Because you're boring.
HARMONY	There. I think the program's done.
CORDELIA	Finally, the nightmare ends. Now how do we save it?
WILLOW	"Deliver."
CORDELIA	Deliver -- where is that -- Oh!
BUFFY	They're close
XANDER	How can you tell?
BUFFY	No rats.
XANDER	Over there. What's that?
XANDER	Jesse!
BUFFY	Oh, no...
XANDER	Jesse!
JESSE	Xander?
XANDER	Jesse, man, are you okay?
JESSE	I'm not okay on an epic scale. We gotta get out of here!
XANDER	It's cool! Buffy's a superhero!
BUFFY	Hold on.
XANDER	You think anybody heard that?
JESSE	They knew you were gonna come. They said that I - I was the bait...
XANDER	Oh, now you tell us.
JESSE	I've seen their leader.
BUFFY	Oops.
JESSE	Oh, no, no...
BUFFY	Do you know another way out?
JESSE	I don't, uh, maybe?
XANDER	Come on.
JESSE	Wait, wait. They brought me through here! There's a way up. I hope.
BUFFY	I don't think this is the way out.
XANDER	We can't fight our way back through those things... what do we do?
JESSE	I've got an idea...
JESSE	You can die. BLACK OUT.
XANDER	Jesse... Man, I'm sorry...
JESSE	Sorry? I feel good, Xander. I feel strong.
JESSE	I'm connected, man. To everything. I can hear the worms in the earth.
XANDER	Well, that's a plus.
JESSE	I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his purpose. That means you die. And I feed.
BUFFY	Xander! The cross!
XANDER	Jesse. Man, we're buds. Can't you remember?
JESSE	You're like a shadow to me now.
XANDER	Then get out of my face.
BUFFY	Help me!
XANDER	I can't believe it... we were too late.
BUFFY	We need to get out of here.
XANDER	There is no out of here!
XANDER	What's that?
BUFFY	Come on!
BUFFY	Go!
XANDER	Up?
BUFFY	UP !
GILES	Buffy?
WILLOW	It's just me. So there's no word?
GILES	Not as of yet.
WILLOW	Well, I'm sure they're... great.
GILES	Did you find anything of interest?
WILLOW	I think maybe. I looked through the old papers, around the time of that big earthquake back in '37. And for several months before it, there was a rash of murders.
GILES	Great! I mean, not great in a good way... Go on.
WILLOW	They sound like the kind you were looking for. Throats, blood. Months, and not even a clue.
GILES	It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.
MASTER	My blood runs with yours. My soul is your province.
LUKE	My body is your instrument.
MASTER	On this most hallowed night, we are as one. Luke is the Vessel. Every soul he takes shall feed me. Their souls will grant me the power to free myself. Tonight I will walk the Earth... and the stars themselves will hide. CUT TO:
WILLOW	Did you find Jesse?
XANDER	Yeah.
WILLOW	Was he dead?
BUFFY	Worse.
BUFFY	I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they were waiting for us.
WILLOW	At least you two are okay.
XANDER	I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.
BUFFY	So, Giles, you got anything that can make this day worse?
GILES	How about the end of the world.
BUFFY	I knew I could count on you.
GILES	This is what we know. Some sixty years ago a very old, very powerful vampire came to this shore, and not just to feed.
BUFFY	He came 'cause this town is a mystical whoosit?
GILES	Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it Boca Del Infierno -- roughly translated: Hellmouth. A sort of portal from this reality to the next. This vampire hoped to open it.
BUFFY	Bring the demons back.
XANDER	End of the world.
WILLOW	But he blew it. Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed about half the town. And him too -- or at least there were no more vampire-type killings after.
GILES	Opening dimensional portals is tricky business. Odds are he got himself stuck. Like a cork in a bottle.
XANDER	And this Harvest thing is to get him out?
GILES	It comes once in a century, on this night. A Master can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds. Enough power to break free, and to open the portal. The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears this symbol.
BUFFY	So, I dust anyone sporting this look, and no Harvest.
GILES	Simply put, yes.
BUFFY	Any clue where this little get-together is being held?
GILES	Well, there are a number of possibilities--
XANDER	They're going to the Bronze.
WILLOW	Are you sure?
XANDER	Come on, tasty young morsels all over the place. Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be. Trust me.
GILES	Then we need to get there. The sun will be down before long.
BUFFY	I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
GILES	What for?
BUFFY	Supplies.
JOYCE	You're going out?
BUFFY	I have to.
JOYCE	I didn't hear you come in last night.
BUFFY	I was quiet.
JOYCE	It's happening again, isn't it?
JOYCE	I got a call from your new principal. Says you missed some classes today.
BUFFY	I was... running an errand.
JOYCE	We haven't finished unpacking and I'm getting calls from your principal.
BUFFY	Mom, I promise you, it's not gonna be like before. But I have to go.
JOYCE	No.
BUFFY	Mom...
JOYCE	The tapes all say I should get used to saying it. No.
BUFFY	This is important.
JOYCE	I know. You have to go out or it'll be the end of the world. Everything is life or death when you're a sixteen year old girl.
BUFFY	Mom, I don't have time to talk about it--
JOYCE	You've got all night, Buffy. You're not going anywhere. Now you can stay up here and sulk if you want. I won't hold it against you. But if you want to come down, I'll make us some dinner.
CORDELIA	Senior boys are the only way to go. They're just a better class of person. The boys in our grade? Forget about it. They're children. Like Jesse -- did you see him last night? The way he follows me around... He's like a little puppy dog: you just want to put him to sleep. Senior boys have mystery, they have ... what's the word I'm searching for? Cars.
CORDELIA	I'm just not the type to settle. If I go into a clothing store, I always have to have the most expensive thing not because it's expensive , but because it costs more.
CORDELIA	Hello! Miss Motormouth -- can I get a sentence finished? Oh! I love this song!
CORDELIA	What do you want?
CORDELIA	Hey! Hello, caveman-brain! What do you think you're doing?
JESSE	Shut up.
CORDELIA	Just this one dance...
BOUNCER	I need ID. Hey! Nobody goes inside until I see --
LUKE	Get inside.
LUKE	Ladies and gentlemen, there's no cause for alarm.
LUKE	Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won't do any good.
CORDELIA	I thought there wasn't any band tonight.
LUKE	This is a glorious night. It's also the last one any of you shall ever see. Bring me the first!
BOUNCER	What do you guys want, you want money? Man, what's wrong with your faces?
LUKE	Watch me, people! Their fear is elixir. It's almost like blood.
LUKE	Next! CUT TO:
BUFFY	It's locked.
GILES	We're too late.
BUFFY	Well, I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!
XANDER	Can you break it down?
BUFFY	Not this thing. You guys try the back entrance. I'll find my own way.
GILES	Right. Come on.
BUFFY	Guys!
JESSE	This one's mine.
DARLA	They are all for the Master.
JESSE	I don't get one?
LUKE	I feel him rising! I need another!
BUFFY	The Vessel...
LUKE	Tonight in his ascension. Tonight will be History at its end! Yours is a glorious sacrifice. Degradation most holy. What, no volunteers?
DARLA	Here's a pretty one.
CORDELIA	Noooo...
BUFFY	Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle something.
LUKE	YOU!
BUFFY	You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?
LUKE	I hoped you'd come.
BUFFY	Okay, Vessel-boy. You want blood?
LUKE	I want yours. Only yours.
BUFFY	Then come and get it.
XANDER	Come on! CUT TO:
XANDER	Heads up...
JESSE	Hold still! You're not helping.
XANDER	Jesse, man... don't make me do it.
JESSE	Buddy...
LUKE	I've always wanted to kill a Slayer... CUT TO:
GILES	Come on! We've got to open the front as well!
XANDER	Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in there.
JESSE	Okay, let's deal with this. Jesse was an excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with anyone in the sighted community! Look at me now! I'm a new man!
JESSE	See, the old Jesse would have reasoned with you. CUT TO:
LUKE	Master, taste of this and be free.
BUFFY	How'd it taste?
JESSE	I'm sick of you getting in the way, you know? Cordelia, she's gonna live forever. You're not.
JESSE	Oh, right! Put me out of my misery! You don't have the g--
LUKE	You forget. Metal can't hurt me.
BUFFY	There's something you forgot about, too.
BUFFY	Sunrise.
BUFFY	It's in about nine hours, moron.
MASTER	Nooooo....
GILES	I take it it's over.
WILLOW	Did we win?
BUFFY	Well, we averted the apocalypse. You gotta give us points for that.
XANDER	One thing's for sure. Nothing is ever gonna be the same. CUT TO:
CORDELIA	Well, I heard it was rival gangs. Anyway, Buffy totally knew these guys which is too weird. I can't remember anything too well, but I'm telling you, it was a freak show.
GIRL	Oh, I wish I'd been there.
BUFFY	Well, what exactly were you expecting?
XANDER	I don't know! Something. The dead rose! We should've at least had an assembly.
GILES	People have a tendency to rationalize what they can, and forget what they can't.
BUFFY	Believe me, I've seen it happen.
WILLOW	Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.
GILES	Good. Next time you'll be prepared.
XANDER	Next time?
WILLOW	Next time is why?
GILES	We stopped the master from freeing himself and opening the mouth of Hell. Doesn't mean he'll stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.
WILLOW	More vampires?
GILES	Not just vampires. The next creature we face may be something quite different.
BUFFY	I can hardly wait.
GILES	We're at a center of mystical convergence here. We may in fact stand between the earth and total destruction.
XANDER	Buffy, this isn't good.
BUFFY	Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.
XANDER	Hey, that's a plan. 'Cause a lot of schools aren't on Hellmouths.
WILLOW	Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.
BUFFY	I was aiming for a subtle approach, like excessive not studying.
GILES	The earth is doomed. BLACK OUT.
WILLOW	Xander, are you okay?
XANDER	Man... something hit me...
BUFFY	Where's Jesse?
WILLOW	I don't know -- they surrounded us -- he was really weak...
XANDER	That girl grabbed him. Took off.
BUFFY	Which way?
XANDER	I don't know.
GILES	In time they lost their purchase on this reality, and the way was made for the mortal animals. For Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges: Certain magicks, certain creatures...
BUFFY	And vampires...
XANDER	Okay, this is where I have a problem, see, because we're now talking about vampires. We're having a talk with vampires in it.
WILLOW	Oooh... I need to sit down.
BUFFY	You are sitting down.
WILLOW	Oh. Good for me.
XANDER	So vampires are demons?
GILES	The books tell that the last Demon to leave this reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He was a human form possessed -- infected -- by the Demon's soul. He bit another, and another... and so they walk the earth, feeding. Killing some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out, and the Old Ones to return.
MASTER	Is this for me?
LUKE	An offering, Master.
DARLA	He's a good one. His blood is pure.

DARLA	I didn't mean to --
DARLA	Master, forgive me. We had more offerings but there was trouble. A girl.
LUKE	There was a girl. She fought well, and she knew of our breed. It's possible that she may be...
XANDER	And that would be a what?

XANDER	Except for one thing. How do you kill them?
BUFFY	You don't. I do.
XANDER	Well, Jesse --
BUFFY	Jesse's my responsibility. I let him get taken.
XANDER	That's not true.
WILLOW	If you hadn't showed up, they would have... taken us too... Does anybody mind if I pass out.
BUFFY	Breathe...
WILLOW	Breathe.
BUFFY	Breathe. This big guy, Luke, he talked about an offering to the Master. I don't know who or what, but if they weren't just feeding, Jesse may still be alive. I'm gonna find him.
WILLOW	This is probably the dumb question, but shouldn't we call the police?
GILES	Do you think they'd believe us?
WILLOW	We don't have to say vampires. We could say there was... a bad man.
BUFFY	They couldn't handle it if they did come. They'd only show up with guns.
GILES	You've no idea where they took Jesse?
BUFFY	I looked around, but... soon as they got clear of the woods they could have just --whoom.
XANDER	They can fly ?
BUFFY	They can drive.
XANDER	Oh.
WILLOW	I don't remember hearing a car...
GILES	Well, let's take an enormous intuitive leap and say they went underground.
BUFFY	Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get anywhere in town without catching any rays. I didn't see any access around there, though.
XANDER	Well, there's electrical tunnels. They run under the whole town.
GILES	If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it might indicate a meeting place. I suppose we could go to the building commission --
BUFFY	We so don't have time.
WILLOW	Uh, guys? There may be another way.
MASTER	A Slayer... Have you any proof?
LUKE	Only that she fought me and yet lives.
MASTER	Very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the last time that happened.
LUKE	1843, in Madrid. And the bastard caught me sleeping.

XANDER	Someone's been naughty...
BUFFY	There's nothing here. This is useless!

BUFFY	We're clear.
FLUTIE	That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school. The sensible girl, with her feet on the ground.
ANGEL	They really don't like me dropping in.
BUFFY	Why not?
ANGEL	They really don't like me.
BUFFY	How could that possibly be?
ANGEL	I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner or later. Actually, I thought it was gonna be a little sooner.
BUFFY	I'm sorry you had to wait. Look, if you're gonna be popping up with this cryptic wise man act on a regular basis, can you at least tell me your name?
ANGEL	Angel.
BUFFY	Angel. It's a pretty name.
ANGEL	Don't go down there.
BUFFY	Deal with my going.
ANGEL	You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk. Tonight is the Harvest. Unless you can prevent it, the Master walks.
BUFFY	If this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why don't you stop it?
ANGEL	Because I'm afraid.
ANGEL	They'll be expecting you.
BUFFY	I've got a friend down there -- or, a potential friend. Do you know what it's like to have a friend?
XANDER	Did you see anything?
BUFFY	Xander! What are you doing here?
XANDER	Something stupid. I followed you. I couldn't just sit around not doing anything.
BUFFY	I understand. Now go away.
XANDER	Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him, then that's what I gotta do.
CORDELIA	No! It's suppose to find the syntax and match it. Or, wait...
HARMONY	Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
CORDELIA	No, we're going to the other cool place in Sunnydale.
CORDELIA	Of course we're going to the Bronze! Friday night, no cover. But you should have been there last night.
HARMONY	I think we did this part wrong.
CORDELIA	Why do we have to devise these programs? Isn't that what nerds are for? What did she do?
XANDER	Okay, so: crosses, garlic, stake through the heart.
BUFFY	That'll get it done.
XANDER	Cool. Of course, I don't actually have any of those things.
BUFFY	Good thinking.
XANDER	Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to come down here. I brought this, though.
BUFFY	Turn that off!
XANDER	Okay, okay. So, what else?
BUFFY	What else what?
XANDER	For Vampire Slayage.
XANDER	So you've done some beheading in your time.
BUFFY	Oh, yeah. There was this one time, I was pinned down by this vampire, he played left tackle for the varsity -- I mean, before he was... well anyway he's got one of those really thick necks and all I've got is a little Exacto knife -- You're not loving this story.
XANDER	Actually, I find it oddly comforting.
CORDELIA	Okay, and then "Pattern Run" right? Or "Go To End". That's it.
HARMONY	Maybe... I think...
CORDELIA	Well, what does the book say? So anyway, I come out of the bathroom and she comes running at me with a stick, screaming, "I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!" I swear.
GUY	Who?
CORDELIA	Buffy.
HARMONY	The new girl.
GUY	What's her deal?
CORDELIA	She's crazed!
HARMONY	Did you hear about her old school? Booted.
CORDELIA	I exhibit no surprise.
GUY	Why was she kicked out?
CORDELIA	'Cause she's a psycho-loony.
WILLOW	No, she's not.
CORDELIA	What?
WILLOW	She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.
CORDELIA	Excuse me? Who gave you permission to exist? Do I horn in on your private discussions? No. Why? Because you're boring.
HARMONY	There. I think the program's done.
CORDELIA	Finally, the nightmare ends. Now how do we save it?
WILLOW	"Deliver."
CORDELIA	Deliver -- where is that -- Oh!
BUFFY	They're close
XANDER	How can you tell?
BUFFY	No rats.
XANDER	Jesse!
BUFFY	Oh, no...
XANDER	Jesse!
JESSE	Xander?
XANDER	Jesse, man, are you okay?
JESSE	I'm not okay on an epic scale. We gotta get out of here!
JESSE	They knew you were gonna come. They said that I - I was the bait...
XANDER	Oh, now you tell us.
JESSE	I've seen their leader.
BUFFY	Oops.
JESSE	Oh, no, no...
BUFFY	Do you know another way out?
JESSE	I don't, uh, maybe?
XANDER	Come on.
XANDER	We can't fight our way back through those things... what do we do?
JESSE	I've got an idea...
XANDER	Jesse... Man, I'm sorry...
JESSE	Sorry? I feel good, Xander. I feel strong.
JESSE	I'm connected, man. To everything. I can hear the worms in the earth.
XANDER	Well, that's a plus.
JESSE	I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his purpose. That means you die. And I feed.
BUFFY	Xander! The cross!
XANDER	Jesse. Man, we're buds. Can't you remember?
JESSE	You're like a shadow to me now.
BUFFY	We need to get out of here.
XANDER	There is no out of here!
XANDER	Up?
BUFFY	UP !
GILES	Buffy?
WILLOW	It's just me. So there's no word?
GILES	Not as of yet.
WILLOW	Well, I'm sure they're... great.
GILES	Did you find anything of interest?
WILLOW	I think maybe. I looked through the old papers, around the time of that big earthquake back in '37. And for several months before it, there was a rash of murders.
GILES	Great! I mean, not great in a good way... Go on.
WILLOW	They sound like the kind you were looking for. Throats, blood. Months, and not even a clue.
GILES	It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.
MASTER	My blood runs with yours. My soul is your province.
LUKE	My body is your instrument.
WILLOW	Did you find Jesse?
XANDER	Yeah.
WILLOW	Was he dead?
BUFFY	Worse.
BUFFY	I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they were waiting for us.
WILLOW	At least you two are okay.
XANDER	I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.
BUFFY	So, Giles, you got anything that can make this day worse?
GILES	How about the end of the world.
BUFFY	I knew I could count on you.
GILES	This is what we know. Some sixty years ago a very old, very powerful vampire came to this shore, and not just to feed.
BUFFY	He came 'cause this town is a mystical whoosit?
GILES	Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it Boca Del Infierno -- roughly translated: Hellmouth. A sort of portal from this reality to the next. This vampire hoped to open it.
BUFFY	Bring the demons back.
XANDER	End of the world.
WILLOW	But he blew it. Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed about half the town. And him too -- or at least there were no more vampire-type killings after.
GILES	Opening dimensional portals is tricky business. Odds are he got himself stuck. Like a cork in a bottle.
XANDER	And this Harvest thing is to get him out?
GILES	It comes once in a century, on this night. A Master can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds. Enough power to break free, and to open the portal. The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears this symbol.
BUFFY	So, I dust anyone sporting this look, and no Harvest.
GILES	Simply put, yes.
BUFFY	Any clue where this little get-together is being held?
GILES	Well, there are a number of possibilities--
XANDER	They're going to the Bronze.
WILLOW	Are you sure?
XANDER	Come on, tasty young morsels all over the place. Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be. Trust me.
GILES	Then we need to get there. The sun will be down before long.
BUFFY	I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
GILES	What for?
BUFFY	Supplies.
JOYCE	You're going out?
BUFFY	I have to.
JOYCE	I didn't hear you come in last night.
BUFFY	I was quiet.
JOYCE	It's happening again, isn't it?
JOYCE	I got a call from your new principal. Says you missed some classes today.
BUFFY	I was... running an errand.
JOYCE	We haven't finished unpacking and I'm getting calls from your principal.
BUFFY	Mom, I promise you, it's not gonna be like before. But I have to go.
JOYCE	No.
BUFFY	Mom...
JOYCE	The tapes all say I should get used to saying it. No.
BUFFY	This is important.
JOYCE	I know. You have to go out or it'll be the end of the world. Everything is life or death when you're a sixteen year old girl.
BUFFY	Mom, I don't have time to talk about it--
JOYCE	You've got all night, Buffy. You're not going anywhere. Now you can stay up here and sulk if you want. I won't hold it against you. But if you want to come down, I'll make us some dinner.
BUFFY	It's locked.
GILES	We're too late.
BUFFY	Well, I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!
XANDER	Can you break it down?
BUFFY	Not this thing. You guys try the back entrance. I'll find my own way.
GILES	Right. Come on.
BUFFY	Guys!
JESSE	This one's mine.
DARLA	They are all for the Master.
JESSE	I don't get one?
DARLA	Here's a pretty one.
CORDELIA	Noooo...
BUFFY	Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle something.
LUKE	YOU!
BUFFY	You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?
LUKE	I hoped you'd come.
LUKE	I want yours. Only yours.
BUFFY	Then come and get it.
XANDER	Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in there.
JESSE	Okay, let's deal with this. Jesse was an excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with anyone in the sighted community! Look at me now! I'm a new man!
LUKE	You forget. Metal can't hurt me.
BUFFY	There's something you forgot about, too.
GILES	I take it it's over.
WILLOW	Did we win?
CORDELIA	Well, I heard it was rival gangs. Anyway, Buffy totally knew these guys which is too weird. I can't remember anything too well, but I'm telling you, it was a freak show.
GIRL	Oh, I wish I'd been there.
BUFFY	Well, what exactly were you expecting?
XANDER	I don't know! Something. The dead rose! We should've at least had an assembly.
GILES	People have a tendency to rationalize what they can, and forget what they can't.
BUFFY	Believe me, I've seen it happen.
WILLOW	Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.
GILES	Good. Next time you'll be prepared.
XANDER	Next time?
WILLOW	Next time is why?
GILES	We stopped the master from freeing himself and opening the mouth of Hell. Doesn't mean he'll stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.
WILLOW	More vampires?
GILES	Not just vampires. The next creature we face may be something quite different.
BUFFY	I can hardly wait.
GILES	We're at a center of mystical convergence here. We may in fact stand between the earth and total destruction.
XANDER	Buffy, this isn't good.
BUFFY	Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.
XANDER	Hey, that's a plan. 'Cause a lot of schools aren't on Hellmouths.
WILLOW	Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.
BUFFY	I was aiming for a subtle approach, like excessive not studying.

SPIKE	Well, all right! Got the moves, don't you? Gonna ride you hard before I put you away, luv.
NIKKI	Sure about that? You seem a little wet and limp to me. And I'm not your "luv."
SPIKE	Tsk, tsk, tsk. Taken me a long time to track you down. Don't really want to end the dance so soon, do you, Nikki? Music's just startin', in'it?
NIKKI	Did real good, baby boy. Stayed down just like Mama told you.
ROBIN	Can we go home now?
NIKKI	Nuh-uh... Not safe there anymore. Hey, how 'bout I leave you with Crowley? He's got those spooky doodads you like playin' --
ROBIN	No. I wanna stay with you.
NIKKI	Yeah, I know you do, baby. But... Remember, Robin honey... what we talked about... Always gotta work the mission.
SPIKE	Little tip, mate. The stake's your friend, don't be afraid to use it.
WOOD	Just waiting for my moment...
BUFFY	Or as normal as this school ever sees.
WOOD	So it appears.
BUFFY	Well, no fires, nobody's head's gone ka-blooey. And the marching band and swing choir have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.
WOOD	Been pretty quiet around her since you shut down that Seal. You may have stopped this thing.
BUFFY	I saw an army of Ubervamps. In my vision. An army was going to rise up from the Hellmouth. From that Seal. To think I stopped The First... It can't be that easy.
WOOD	Call that easy?
BUFFY	Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying. Those are the easy ones.
WOOD	Y'know, you're something else, Miss Summers. I've been watching you. When we're out patrolling. You're... You remind me of...
BUFFY	Your mother?
WOOD	Well... Yeah. Actually. What I remember of her.
BUFFY	Gotta tell ya, not a line every girl likes to hear. But, in this case - compliment taken.
GILES	A total catastrophe.
BUFFY	Giles -- what's wrong?
GILES	Have you seen the new library? It's nothing but computers. Not a book to be seen. I don't know where to begin... Buffy, who do we talk to?
WOOD	I guess that'd be me... Hi. Robin Wood.
GILES	Yes, of course. Rupert Giles. Buffy's told me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.
BUFFY	So. I didn't stop it then.
GILES	The seers in the coven are certain The First is continuing to gather its forces. The few Potential Slayers left across the globe are still being murdered before we can get to them. I'm afraid war is inevitable.
WOOD	What?
GILES	I can have my backup library sent from home, in the meantime. It isn't much, but--
BUFFY	Giles --
GILES	Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeroes.
BUFFY	Did you bring back more Potentials?
GILES	Ah, no. Actually my trip was on a different matter. Regarding Spike.
BUFFY	Spike? What about him?
GILES	Buffy, I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose to remove the chip in his head.
WOOD	Wait. Sorry. Chip?
GILES	Long story--
BUFFY	Military put a chip in Spike's brain so he couldn't hurt anyone.
GILES	And that would be the abridged version.
BUFFY	He has a soul now, Giles. Spike won't let himself harm anyone.
GILES	Unless The First triggers him again.
WOOD	Triggers the chip?
BUFFY	The trigger's a post-hypnotic deal The First put in his head. Made him... He was killing again.
WOOD	So he's got a trigger, a soul and a chip.
GILES	Not anymore.
BUFFY	It was killing him, Giles.
WOOD	The trigger?
BUFFY	The chip. The trigger's not working anymore.
WOOD	Because the military gave him a soul.
GILES	We don't know that the trigger's inactive. But I've brought something back with me that may help us to disarm it. And ascertain what it is, exactly, that causes Spike's behavior.
BUFFY	It's that song. I'm sure it has to do with that song he was singing.
GILES	Yes, but he has no memory of it. Is there any part of it you can remember?
BUFFY	I dunno. I mean... Not like it had a catchy hook or anything, like, "I'm Comin' Up So You Better Get This Party Started." It was boring, old, and English. Just like yo-- --ul. Brynner. Yul Brynner. A... British Yul Brynner.
WOOD	This thing you brought. To keep Spike from killing again. How does it work?
GILES	It will require a bit of magic.
KENNEDY	...It's not right. We're all a part of this. Whatever's happening, we should know--
ANDREW	Hey. What's going on, girlfriend?
KENNEDY	Buffy and the others are up to something in the cellar.
ANDREW	What others?
RONA	Y'know. Senior officers. Only they're not telling us grunts squat.
MOLLY	Unless you count "stay away."
ANDREW	Did they mention me... specifically? As in, "tell Andrew not to come down here. Because we hate him."
KENNEDY	No.
ANDREW	Well, then... I think I'll just go down there and... demand to know what's going on.
ANYA	You don't want to go down there.
ANDREW	As a matter of fact, Anya, I do. We're all a part of this. Whatever's happening, we have a right to know. (to others) Don't we, girls?
ANYA	They're doing something that's gonna set off that psycho trigger The First put in Spike's melon.
ANDREW	I see. You mean, the one that makes him Hulk-out, smash through walls and... rip into my throat?
ANYA	Yuh-huh.
ANDREW	'Kay. Thanks.
XANDER	Couldn't have put the chains back up a week ago... no, we have to wait 'til "pretending time's" over to work on Spike...
SPIKE	What?
XANDER	Nothing.
SPIKE	What you doin' here? Came to see the show?
WOOD	Thought you might need the support.
SPIKE	Uh huh. Right. Let's get this over with. What're you gonna do? Some hypno- beam or disarming spell?
GILES	Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you. There's something in your subconscious The First is using to provoke a violent reaction. So.
SPIKE	Bugger that.
GILES	S'alright. It's completely painless. So I'm told. The Prokaryote stone will help unlock your subconscious to get to the root of the trigger's power. Help you understand it. Hopefully, break its hold over you.
DAWN	Hopefully. So it might not work.
GILES	The stone's only a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike. He needs to overcome whatever mental weakness is allowing his brain to be manipulated this way.
SPIKE	And how'd you expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
GILES	Willow...
WILLOW	'kay. Just hope my pronunciation's in the ballpark.
SPIKE	You've got to be joking. What now? In the ear? Up the nostrils?
GILES	It has to enter your cerebral cortex through the optic nerve.
SPIKE	Oh, bollocks-- All the rubbish people keep sticking in my head... it's a wonder there's room for my brain.
GILES	I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
BUFFY	Spike --
XANDER	Ah! The eye's have it! I know. A personal low.
BUFFY	Listen to me. It's okay. Spike?
SPIKE	Yeah...
BUFFY	You all right?
SPIKE	How'm I suppose to know if this bug ugly's doin' its--
WILLIAM	"...her eyes, balls of honey/angel's' harps, her laugh/oh, lark, grant a sign/if crook'd be cupid's shaft..."
ANNE	Oh, William...
WILLIAM	It's just scribbling.
ANNE	Nonsense. It's magnificent.
WILLIAM	Honestly? You really think so, Mother?
ANNE	Oh, yes. You've a rare gift.
WILLIAM	Would that certain publishers thought as you.
ANNE	Well, you mustn't be disheartened. They're envious. Clearly, you're a man before your ti--
WILLIAM	Wonder?
ANNE	This "Cecily" of whom you write so often... Would that be the Underwoods' eldest girl?
WILLIAM	Oh, no, I don't presume -
ANNE	She's lovely. And you shouldn't be alone. You need a woman in your life.
WILLIAM	I have a woman in my life.
ANNE	You, what? You've never-- Oh.
WILLIAM	Do not mistake me -- I have hopes that one day there will be an addition to this household... But I will always look after you, Mother. This I promise.
ANNE	No. No, I'll be all right. It's... it's passed. Just sit with me a while, will you?
WILLIAM	Of course.
ANNE	EARLY ONE MORNING, JUST AS THE SUN WAS RISING, I HEARD A MAID SING IN THE VALLEY BELOW...
WILLOW	Dawn!
WILLOW	Does that hurt?
DAWN	Ow. Yes.
ANDREW	I can't believe there was a Wrath of Khan moment downstairs and I missed it.
XANDER	Did Ricardo Montalban throw a bed at somebody?
ANDREW	In the movie or in real life?
XANDER	What?
ANDREW	Wait. What are we talking about?
DAWN	You two are making my head angry.
WILLOW	Sorry. Doesn't looks like anything's broken...
DAWN	Did you do some sort of magic x-ray?
WILLOW	No, just usually the thing people say.
KENNEDY	So Spike's trigger's been active this entire time.
RONA	How could Buffy take that for granted? He lives in our house. We train with him.
ANYA	Oh, don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of "Get- Out-Of-Jail-Free" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. He could slaughter a hundred frat boys and he--
ANDREW	Willow. Call for you. From L.A. Somebody named Fred. Guy sounds kinda effeminate.
SPIKE	Get me out of these sodding things already! I'm fine.
BUFFY	Don't you think you should take a little time first. To calm down.
SPIKE	I am calm. Stone o'yours is out, in'it? Did its job. So, I'm de-triggered, right?
GILES	Spike. What do you remember? About the song...
SPIKE	Yeah. The song. 's called "Early One Morning." Old folk ditty...
WOOD	What's it mean to you?
SPIKE	Mean? Nothing. Just... My mum...
GILES	And...?
SPIKE	No "and." That's it.
BUFFY	She'll be okay. She's tough.
GILES	Listen to me , Spike. What is it about your mother--
SPIKE	I dunno. We got on fine. She was a good lady.
GILES	There has to be more to it than--
SPIKE	Well, there bloody well isn't.
GILES	What are you doing?
BUFFY	I'm going to unchain him.
GILES	Buffy --
BUFFY	Giles, this is pointless. He doesn't know anything. Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
GILES	Because he's not cooperating. The process takes time. He's blocking whatever's flooding into his consciousness, and as long as he does so, we're in danger.
WOOD	So the trigger's still working?
GILES	As much as ever.
DRUSILLA	Ooh, such a pretty house you have, sweet Willy. Smells of daffodils and viscera.
WILLIAM	Don't get too attached, now. Won't be here for long, love.
DRUSILLA	Well, then...
WILLIAM	You are a saucy one, aren't you?
DRUSILLA	It's ripe and ready, my darling. Waiting for us to devour its fruit.
WILLIAM	We'll ravage this city together, my pet. Lay waste to all of Europe. The three of us will teach the snobs and elitists with their falderal just what--
DRUSILLA	Three?
WILLIAM	You, me and Mother. We'll open their veins and bathe in their blood as they scream our names across the-- (off her look) What?
DRUSILLA	You-- You want to bring your mother with us?
WILLIAM	Well... yeah. You'll like her.
DRUSILLA	To eat, you mean?
SPIKE	Mother...
ANNE	Where have you been? I've been beside myself with worry for days...
WILLIAM	You needn't have worried, Mother. You never have to worry about anything again. Something... has happened. I've changed.
ANNE	What have you been doing? I don't-- (re: Drusilla) Who... Who is this woman?
DRUSILLA	I'm the other that gave birth to your son.
ANNE	I beg your pardon.
WILLIAM	It's true, Mother. Drusilla -- She... She's made me what I am. I'm no longer bound to this mortal coil. I have become a creature of the night. A vampire.
ANNE	Are you drunk?
WILLIAM	Little bit. Think of it. No more sickness. No more dying. You'll never age another day. Let me do this for you.
ANNE	What are you talking about? Why are you acting so strange...
WILLIAM	It's still me, Mother. Your William. Though Dru here seems determined to give me a pet name...
DRUSILLA	Yes. Like Willy. Or Bill. Or Lucien, Prince of Lies.
WILLIAM	That's enough, Dru. I think you're scaring Mother.
ANNE	Please. I don't find this amusing...
WILLIAM	It's all right, Mother... It's only me.
ANNE	William...
WILLIAM	It only hurts for a moment.
WILLOW	Just got a phone call. I gotta take off for a little while, maybe a day or so...
BUFFY	Is something wrong?
WILLOW	Nothing you need to worry about. I'll give you the full scoop later. Hopefully I'll bring back some good news.
BUFFY	Could use a little of that... Okay. Guess now's as good a time as we're likely to see for a while. Just hurry back.
WILLOW	Will do.
WOOD	Mr. Giles...
GILES	What's on your mind?
WOOD	Same thing that's on yours. (looking at the top of the stairs) We got a problem.
GILES	Spike.
WOOD	Look, I know I'm an outsider to you people. And you don't know me at all. But I'm fighting for the same reasons. Against the same enemy. So hear me out...
GILES	Go on.
WOOD	I think something has to be done.
GILES	I'm not sure I--
WOOD	You said it yourself. If the trigger's still working, The First must be waiting for the right time to use it against us.
GILES	Does seem doubtful The First simply forget it had such a powerful weapon.
WOOD	A while back it slipped up, told Andrew "it wasn't time yet for Spike." Whatever The First's ultimate plan is, Spike must play an integral part. Something. Needs. To be done.
GILES	Buffy would never allow it.
WOOD	She'd listen to her Watcher, wouldn't she?
GILES	Yes, well, apparently you don't know very much about the Watcher/Slayer dynamic.
WOOD	As a matter of fact, I was raised by a Watcher.
GILES	You what?
WOOD	Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I was a young boy. Trained me.
GILES	Crowley... Yes... I remember the name. New York based Watcher. Resigned shortly after his Slayer was--
WOOD	Yes.
GILES	Spike killed your mother.
WOOD	Yes.
GILES	Does Buffy know this?
WOOD	She knows my mother was a Slayer. She doesn't know about Spike.
GILES	And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance.
WOOD	Does it matter? He's an instrument of evil. He's going to prove to be our undoing in this fight. Buffy's undoing. And she's never gonna see it coming.
GILES	What... exactly are you proposing?
WOOD	I just need you to keep Buffy away for a few hours.
WOOD	After this afternoon, I could use a drink myself. And I didn't have insects rummaging around in my brain.
SPIKE	And?
WOOD	Well, there's concern about stepping out -- even for a bit -- as you're not exactly stable enough to leave...
SPIKE	Yeah, okay, I get it. Look, that leech-thing did a number on me but... I'll be fine.
WOOD	Sure... It just strikes me that there may be better places than a house full of young, potential victims for you to... work through your issues.
SPIKE	What'd you got in mind?
WOOD	Got stacks and stacks of occult books on mind-control back at my house that may help us speed this along. Besides, if anything... bad does happen there's only me to injure, and, well, I'm willing to take the chance.
SPIKE	You sure about that?
WOOD	I'll keep a close eye on you.
BUFFY	I dunno, Giles. Is this really primo time for a training session?
GILES	I'm still your teacher, Buffy. And, no matter how adept a Slayer you are, there'll always be new things to learn. Now more than ever it's crucial to maintain focus upon your calling.
BUFFY	You're talking to me like I'm sixteen again.
GILES	Sometimes the most effective way of moving forward is to start at the beginning.
BUFFY	In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, not sure how I feel about Robin looking after Spike at his place.
GILES	For what it's worth, everyone in your house seemed quite relieved by the arrangement. Buffy, I may not technically be your Watcher anymore... But the fact that there's chaos in your life only underscores the importance of the lessons I can impart to you.
BUFFY	GILES We are on the verge of war. It's time to start looking at the big picture.
BUFFY	Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day I gave an inspirational speech to the telephone repairman.
GILES	Takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be a general, you need to make the proper decisions, regardless of cost.
BUFFY	Have you seen me with those girls? The way I've treated my friends and family? And Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make the hard decisions.
GILES	Well, that's what we're here to find out...
SPIKE	Live in a garage?
WOOD	This is just my work room. Kind of my... sanctuary.
SPIKE	Little place to unwind, huh...
SPIKE	Hard day's principal-ing got you down, need a place to cut loose, let down your hair... So to speak.
WOOD	Something like that...
SPIKE	What the bloody hell's this?
WOOD	I told you. My sanctuary. It's the Hellmouth, Spike. Never be too careful.
SPIKE	Bit much, in'it? What's your story, Wood?
WOOD	No story, really. Trying to do what's right, make a difference.
SPIKE	Sorry. Not much for the self- reflection.
WOOD	Makes sense...
SPIKE	That right?
WOOD	I know more about you than you think, Spike. I've been searching for you for a very... very long time.
SPIKE	Killed a lot of people's mothers.
WOOD	Oh, you'd remember mine...
SPIKE	So, that's it, is it? Brought me here to kill me?
WOOD	No. I don't want to kill you, Spike. I know you're different now. Changed. That you've got a soul. (shaking his head) I don't want to kill you. I want to kill the monster who took my mother from me.
WILLIAM	Mother...?
ANNE	Hello, William.
WILLIAM	Look at you...
ANNE	Mm. Yes. All better.
WILLIAM	You're glowing.
ANNE	Am I? I suppose I have you to thank for that, don't I? How ever will I repay you?
WILLIAM	Seeing you like this is payment enough.
ANNE	Oh, William. You're so... tender.
WILLIAM	This is as it should be, Mother. You and I, together. All of London laid out before us.
ANNE	Ahh, yes. Us.
WILLIAM	First we'll feast. And then the night is yours. The theater perhaps. Dancing... Tell me, what's your pleasure?
ANNE	Pleasure? To take my leave of you, of course.
I	could bear an eternity listening to that twaddle?
WOOD	That's right, dog. Bite back.
ANNE	I do feel extraordinary. It's as though I've been given new eyes. I see everything. Understand... (her eyes land on him) Everything.
WILLIAM	Mother-
ANNE	I hate to be cruel - No. I used to hate to be cruel. In life. Now I find it quite freeing. Nothing less will pry your greedy little fingers from my apron strings, will it?
WILLIAM	Stop, please.
ANNE	The way you've clung since the day you first slithered from me. Like a parasite.
WILLIAM	What are you--
ANNE	Had I known, I would have dashed your brains out the moment I saw you. Spared myself a lifetime of tedium.
ANNE	God, how I prayed you'd find a woman to release me. But you scarcely showed an interest. Who could compare to your doddering, housebound mum? A captive audience for your witless prattle?
SPIKE	NNOOO!!
WILLIAM	Whatever I was... That's not who I am anymore.
ANNE	Darling... It's who you'll always be. A limp, sentimental fool.
WOOD	Hurts, don't it? This what it felt like? (punches him) When you beat the life out of her? Toyed with her? Before you snapped her neck?!
GILES	Don't kill him yet.
BUFFY	What? Why not?
GILES	Because I'm asking you not to.
BUFFY	Sure. Why not. Seems like a nice enough guy.
VAMP	Thanks...?
BUFFY	No problem. You from around here?
GILES	Buffy.
BUFFY	Hey, I'm just saying -- if he's gonna save the world, we should get to know him a little better.
VAMP	My name's Richard.
BUFFY	Hi, Rich.
GILES	And would you let him kill me, if it meant the same?
VAMP	Uh... I'm cool with that.
BUFFY	We've had this conversation before, Giles. When I told you I wouldn't sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory from destroying the world.
GILES	Things are different now, aren't they? After what you've been through. Knowing what you're up against. Faced with the same choice now... you'd let her die.
BUFFY	If I have to. To save the world... Yes.
GILES	No.
BUFFY	Have you heard my speeches?
GILES	That we can't allow any threat that may jeopardize our chances of winning.
BUFFY	Yes. I get it.
GILES	And yet, there is Spike.
WOOD	Animal like you... Never cared for anyone but yourself...
ANNE	Scamper off and cry to your new little trollop. You think you'll be able to love her? You think you'll be able to touch her without feeling me?
WILLIAM	No. I only wanted to make you well.
ANNE	You wanted your hands on me. Perhaps you'd like to finish what you started, hum?
WILLIAM	Please --
ANNE	Come on Willy, have a go before we part. One to remember me by.
WILLIAM	I loved you. I did. Not like this--
ANNE	Just like this. This is what you wanted all along.
WILLIAM	Stop it --
ANNE	Come on. Do it. Who's my little dark prince?
WILLIAM	No!
ANNE	Fine. Then gather up your tears and get out of my house.
WILLIAM	Mother--
ANNE	Get out !
WILLIAM	I'm sorry...
WOOD	What?
SPIKE	I'm sorry.
WOOD	You think "sorry" is gonna make everything right?
SPIKE	Wasn't talking to you.
WOOD	Game?!
SPIKE	She knew what she was signing up for.
WOOD	I didn't sign up for it.
SPIKE	Well, that's the rub, in'it? You didn't sign up for it, and somehow that's my fault.
WOOD	You murdered her.
SPIKE	She sure loved you, didn't she? Enough to risk her life, night after night...
WOOD	You took my childhood... ...when you took her from me. She was all I had. She was my world.
SPIKE	You weren't hers. Doesn't it piss you off?
WOOD	Shut up. You didn't know her.
SPIKE	I know Slayers. No matter how many people they got around them, they fight alone. Life of The Chosen One. Rest of us be damned. Your mum was no different.
WOOD	She... She loved me.
SPIKE	So she said, I expect. Not enough to quit, though, was it? Not enough to walk away. For you.
I	sired her, I set loose a demon and it tore into me... but that was the demon talking, not her. I realize that now. My mum loved me with all her heart. I was her world.
SPIKE	...before I kill you.
GILES	Spike is a liability, Buffy. He refuses to see that. And so do you. Angel left here because he knew how harmful your relationship with him was. Spike, on the other hand, lacks such self-awareness.
BUFFY	Spike's here because I want him here. We need him. I'm in the fight of my life.
VAMP	Really...?
BUFFY	Not you, Richard.
GILES	You want Spike here even after what he's done to you in the past?
BUFFY	It's different. He has a soul now.
GILES	Yes, and The First seems to be exploiting it to his advantage.
BUFFY	Exactly. The First's doing this. Spike's innocent.
GILES	So was Ben.
BUFFY	Ben?
GILES	He was a human being, after all. Forced, his whole life, to share his mortal form with a demi-god from a hell-dimension.
BUFFY	Glory. I know. What does that have to do--
GILES	Ben was oblivious to the atrocities Glory committed. No more responsible for her crimes than Spike is to his, when triggered.
BUFFY	Giles...
GILES	I put my hand over his mouth. And as he struggled, weakly... I smothered him. Because it had to be done. (looks at Buffy) He was a liability.
BUFFY	Oh god... You've been stalling me. Keeping me away--
GILES	Buffy, it's time to stop playing the role of a general and start being one.
BUFFY	Are you okay?
SPIKE	I gave him a pass. Let him live. On account of the face that I killed his mother.
BUFFY	I lost my mom a couple years ago. I came home and found her dead on the couch.
WOOD	I'm sorry.
BUFFY	I understand... what you tried to do. But she's dead. He killed her.
WOOD	She got herself killed.
BUFFY	And none of it matters. We're preparing to fight a war, and you're looking for revenge on a man who doesn't exist anymore.
WOOD	Don't delude yourself. That man still exists...
BUFFY	Spike's the strongest warrior I have, and we need him if we're going to get through this alive. If you try anything again, he's going to kill you, but more importantly, I'm going to let him.
GILES	I understand your anger... but please believe me when I tell you we did what we did for the good of all --
BUFFY	He's alive, Giles. Spike's alive. Wood failed.
GILES	That changes nothing. What I said to you before is still true. You need to learn --
BUFFY	No...
SPIKE	Well, all right! Got the moves, don't you? Gonna ride you hard before I put you away, luv.
NIKKI	Sure about that? You seem a little wet and limp to me. And I'm not your "luv."
NIKKI	Did real good, baby boy. Stayed down just like Mama told you.
ROBIN	Can we go home now?
NIKKI	Nuh-uh... Not safe there anymore. Hey, how 'bout I leave you with Crowley? He's got those spooky doodads you like playin' --
ROBIN	No. I wanna stay with you.
BUFFY	Or as normal as this school ever sees.
WOOD	So it appears.
BUFFY	Well, no fires, nobody's head's gone ka-blooey. And the marching band and swing choir have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.
WOOD	Been pretty quiet around her since you shut down that Seal. You may have stopped this thing.
BUFFY	I saw an army of Ubervamps. In my vision. An army was going to rise up from the Hellmouth. From that Seal. To think I stopped The First... It can't be that easy.
WOOD	Call that easy?
BUFFY	Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying. Those are the easy ones.
BUFFY	Your mother?
WOOD	Well... Yeah. Actually. What I remember of her.
BUFFY	Gotta tell ya, not a line every girl likes to hear. But, in this case - compliment taken.
GILES	A total catastrophe.
BUFFY	Giles -- what's wrong?
GILES	Have you seen the new library? It's nothing but computers. Not a book to be seen. I don't know where to begin... Buffy, who do we talk to?
WOOD	I guess that'd be me... Hi. Robin Wood.
GILES	Yes, of course. Rupert Giles. Buffy's told me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.
BUFFY	So. I didn't stop it then.
GILES	The seers in the coven are certain The First is continuing to gather its forces. The few Potential Slayers left across the globe are still being murdered before we can get to them. I'm afraid war is inevitable.
WOOD	What?
GILES	I can have my backup library sent from home, in the meantime. It isn't much, but--
BUFFY	Giles --
GILES	Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeroes.
BUFFY	Did you bring back more Potentials?
GILES	Ah, no. Actually my trip was on a different matter. Regarding Spike.
BUFFY	Spike? What about him?
GILES	Buffy, I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose to remove the chip in his head.
WOOD	Wait. Sorry. Chip?
GILES	Long story--
BUFFY	Military put a chip in Spike's brain so he couldn't hurt anyone.
GILES	And that would be the abridged version.
BUFFY	He has a soul now, Giles. Spike won't let himself harm anyone.
GILES	Unless The First triggers him again.
WOOD	Triggers the chip?
BUFFY	The trigger's a post-hypnotic deal The First put in his head. Made him... He was killing again.
WOOD	So he's got a trigger, a soul and a chip.
GILES	Not anymore.
BUFFY	It was killing him, Giles.
WOOD	The trigger?
BUFFY	The chip. The trigger's not working anymore.
WOOD	Because the military gave him a soul.
GILES	We don't know that the trigger's inactive. But I've brought something back with me that may help us to disarm it. And ascertain what it is, exactly, that causes Spike's behavior.
BUFFY	It's that song. I'm sure it has to do with that song he was singing.
GILES	Yes, but he has no memory of it. Is there any part of it you can remember?
BUFFY	I dunno. I mean... Not like it had a catchy hook or anything, like, "I'm Comin' Up So You Better Get This Party Started." It was boring, old, and English. Just like yo-- --ul. Brynner. Yul Brynner. A... British Yul Brynner.
WOOD	This thing you brought. To keep Spike from killing again. How does it work?
GILES	It will require a bit of magic.
KENNEDY	...It's not right. We're all a part of this. Whatever's happening, we should know--
ANDREW	Hey. What's going on, girlfriend?
KENNEDY	Buffy and the others are up to something in the cellar.
ANDREW	What others?
RONA	Y'know. Senior officers. Only they're not telling us grunts squat.
MOLLY	Unless you count "stay away."
ANDREW	Did they mention me... specifically? As in, "tell Andrew not to come down here. Because we hate him."
KENNEDY	No.
ANDREW	Well, then... I think I'll just go down there and... demand to know what's going on.
ANDREW	As a matter of fact, Anya, I do. We're all a part of this. Whatever's happening, we have a right to know. (to others) Don't we, girls?
ANYA	They're doing something that's gonna set off that psycho trigger The First put in Spike's melon.
ANDREW	I see. You mean, the one that makes him Hulk-out, smash through walls and... rip into my throat?
ANYA	Yuh-huh.
ANDREW	'Kay. Thanks.
XANDER	Couldn't have put the chains back up a week ago... no, we have to wait 'til "pretending time's" over to work on Spike...
SPIKE	What?
XANDER	Nothing.
SPIKE	What you doin' here? Came to see the show?
WOOD	Thought you might need the support.
SPIKE	Uh huh. Right. Let's get this over with. What're you gonna do? Some hypno- beam or disarming spell?
GILES	Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you. There's something in your subconscious The First is using to provoke a violent reaction. So.
SPIKE	Bugger that.
GILES	S'alright. It's completely painless. So I'm told. The Prokaryote stone will help unlock your subconscious to get to the root of the trigger's power. Help you understand it. Hopefully, break its hold over you.
DAWN	Hopefully. So it might not work.
GILES	The stone's only a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike. He needs to overcome whatever mental weakness is allowing his brain to be manipulated this way.
SPIKE	And how'd you expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
GILES	Willow...
WILLOW	'kay. Just hope my pronunciation's in the ballpark.
SPIKE	You've got to be joking. What now? In the ear? Up the nostrils?
GILES	It has to enter your cerebral cortex through the optic nerve.
SPIKE	Oh, bollocks-- All the rubbish people keep sticking in my head... it's a wonder there's room for my brain.
GILES	I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
BUFFY	Spike --
XANDER	Ah! The eye's have it! I know. A personal low.
SPIKE	Yeah...
BUFFY	You all right?
ANNE	Oh, William...
WILLIAM	It's just scribbling.
ANNE	Nonsense. It's magnificent.
WILLIAM	Honestly? You really think so, Mother?
ANNE	Oh, yes. You've a rare gift.
WILLIAM	Would that certain publishers thought as you.
ANNE	Well, you mustn't be disheartened. They're envious. Clearly, you're a man before your ti--
WILLIAM	Wonder?
ANNE	This "Cecily" of whom you write so often... Would that be the Underwoods' eldest girl?
WILLIAM	Oh, no, I don't presume -
ANNE	She's lovely. And you shouldn't be alone. You need a woman in your life.
WILLIAM	I have a woman in my life.
ANNE	You, what? You've never-- Oh.
WILLIAM	Do not mistake me -- I have hopes that one day there will be an addition to this household... But I will always look after you, Mother. This I promise.
ANNE	No. No, I'll be all right. It's... it's passed. Just sit with me a while, will you?
WILLIAM	Of course.
WILLOW	Does that hurt?
DAWN	Ow. Yes.
ANDREW	I can't believe there was a Wrath of Khan moment downstairs and I missed it.
XANDER	Did Ricardo Montalban throw a bed at somebody?
ANDREW	In the movie or in real life?
XANDER	What?
ANDREW	Wait. What are we talking about?
DAWN	You two are making my head angry.
WILLOW	Sorry. Doesn't looks like anything's broken...
DAWN	Did you do some sort of magic x-ray?
WILLOW	No, just usually the thing people say.
KENNEDY	So Spike's trigger's been active this entire time.
RONA	How could Buffy take that for granted? He lives in our house. We train with him.
ANYA	Oh, don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of "Get- Out-Of-Jail-Free" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. He could slaughter a hundred frat boys and he--
SPIKE	Get me out of these sodding things already! I'm fine.
BUFFY	Don't you think you should take a little time first. To calm down.
SPIKE	I am calm. Stone o'yours is out, in'it? Did its job. So, I'm de-triggered, right?
GILES	Spike. What do you remember? About the song...
SPIKE	Yeah. The song. 's called "Early One Morning." Old folk ditty...
WOOD	What's it mean to you?
SPIKE	Mean? Nothing. Just... My mum...
GILES	And...?
SPIKE	No "and." That's it.
BUFFY	She'll be okay. She's tough.
GILES	Listen to me , Spike. What is it about your mother--
SPIKE	I dunno. We got on fine. She was a good lady.
GILES	There has to be more to it than--
SPIKE	Well, there bloody well isn't.
GILES	What are you doing?
BUFFY	I'm going to unchain him.
GILES	Buffy --
BUFFY	Giles, this is pointless. He doesn't know anything. Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
GILES	Because he's not cooperating. The process takes time. He's blocking whatever's flooding into his consciousness, and as long as he does so, we're in danger.
WOOD	So the trigger's still working?
GILES	As much as ever.
DRUSILLA	Ooh, such a pretty house you have, sweet Willy. Smells of daffodils and viscera.
WILLIAM	Don't get too attached, now. Won't be here for long, love.
DRUSILLA	Well, then...
WILLIAM	You are a saucy one, aren't you?
DRUSILLA	It's ripe and ready, my darling. Waiting for us to devour its fruit.
WILLIAM	We'll ravage this city together, my pet. Lay waste to all of Europe. The three of us will teach the snobs and elitists with their falderal just what--
DRUSILLA	Three?
WILLIAM	You, me and Mother. We'll open their veins and bathe in their blood as they scream our names across the-- (off her look) What?
DRUSILLA	You-- You want to bring your mother with us?
WILLIAM	Well... yeah. You'll like her.
DRUSILLA	To eat, you mean?
SPIKE	Mother...
ANNE	Where have you been? I've been beside myself with worry for days...
ANNE	What have you been doing? I don't-- (re: Drusilla) Who... Who is this woman?
DRUSILLA	I'm the other that gave birth to your son.
ANNE	I beg your pardon.
WILLIAM	It's true, Mother. Drusilla -- She... She's made me what I am. I'm no longer bound to this mortal coil. I have become a creature of the night. A vampire.
ANNE	Are you drunk?
WILLIAM	Little bit. Think of it. No more sickness. No more dying. You'll never age another day. Let me do this for you.
ANNE	What are you talking about? Why are you acting so strange...
WILLIAM	It's still me, Mother. Your William. Though Dru here seems determined to give me a pet name...
DRUSILLA	Yes. Like Willy. Or Bill. Or Lucien, Prince of Lies.
WILLIAM	That's enough, Dru. I think you're scaring Mother.
ANNE	Please. I don't find this amusing...
WILLIAM	It's all right, Mother... It's only me.
WILLOW	Just got a phone call. I gotta take off for a little while, maybe a day or so...
BUFFY	Is something wrong?
WILLOW	Nothing you need to worry about. I'll give you the full scoop later. Hopefully I'll bring back some good news.
BUFFY	Could use a little of that... Okay. Guess now's as good a time as we're likely to see for a while. Just hurry back.
WILLOW	Will do.
GILES	What's on your mind?
WOOD	Same thing that's on yours. (looking at the top of the stairs) We got a problem.
GILES	Spike.
WOOD	Look, I know I'm an outsider to you people. And you don't know me at all. But I'm fighting for the same reasons. Against the same enemy. So hear me out...
GILES	Go on.
WOOD	I think something has to be done.
GILES	I'm not sure I--
WOOD	You said it yourself. If the trigger's still working, The First must be waiting for the right time to use it against us.
GILES	Does seem doubtful The First simply forget it had such a powerful weapon.
WOOD	A while back it slipped up, told Andrew "it wasn't time yet for Spike." Whatever The First's ultimate plan is, Spike must play an integral part. Something. Needs. To be done.
GILES	Buffy would never allow it.
WOOD	She'd listen to her Watcher, wouldn't she?
GILES	Yes, well, apparently you don't know very much about the Watcher/Slayer dynamic.
WOOD	As a matter of fact, I was raised by a Watcher.
GILES	You what?
WOOD	Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I was a young boy. Trained me.
GILES	Crowley... Yes... I remember the name. New York based Watcher. Resigned shortly after his Slayer was--
WOOD	Yes.
GILES	Spike killed your mother.
WOOD	Yes.
GILES	Does Buffy know this?
WOOD	She knows my mother was a Slayer. She doesn't know about Spike.
GILES	And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance.
WOOD	Does it matter? He's an instrument of evil. He's going to prove to be our undoing in this fight. Buffy's undoing. And she's never gonna see it coming.
GILES	What... exactly are you proposing?
WOOD	I just need you to keep Buffy away for a few hours.
SPIKE	And?
WOOD	Well, there's concern about stepping out -- even for a bit -- as you're not exactly stable enough to leave...
SPIKE	Yeah, okay, I get it. Look, that leech-thing did a number on me but... I'll be fine.
WOOD	Sure... It just strikes me that there may be better places than a house full of young, potential victims for you to... work through your issues.
SPIKE	What'd you got in mind?
WOOD	Got stacks and stacks of occult books on mind-control back at my house that may help us speed this along. Besides, if anything... bad does happen there's only me to injure, and, well, I'm willing to take the chance.
SPIKE	You sure about that?
WOOD	I'll keep a close eye on you.
BUFFY	I dunno, Giles. Is this really primo time for a training session?
GILES	I'm still your teacher, Buffy. And, no matter how adept a Slayer you are, there'll always be new things to learn. Now more than ever it's crucial to maintain focus upon your calling.
BUFFY	You're talking to me like I'm sixteen again.
GILES	Sometimes the most effective way of moving forward is to start at the beginning.
BUFFY	In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, not sure how I feel about Robin looking after Spike at his place.
GILES	For what it's worth, everyone in your house seemed quite relieved by the arrangement. Buffy, I may not technically be your Watcher anymore... But the fact that there's chaos in your life only underscores the importance of the lessons I can impart to you.
BUFFY	GILES We are on the verge of war. It's time to start looking at the big picture.
BUFFY	Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day I gave an inspirational speech to the telephone repairman.
GILES	Takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be a general, you need to make the proper decisions, regardless of cost.
BUFFY	Have you seen me with those girls? The way I've treated my friends and family? And Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make the hard decisions.
GILES	Well, that's what we're here to find out...
SPIKE	What the bloody hell's this?
WOOD	I told you. My sanctuary. It's the Hellmouth, Spike. Never be too careful.
SPIKE	Sorry. Not much for the self- reflection.
WOOD	Makes sense...
SPIKE	That right?
WOOD	I know more about you than you think, Spike. I've been searching for you for a very... very long time.
WILLIAM	Look at you...
ANNE	Mm. Yes. All better.
WILLIAM	You're glowing.
ANNE	Am I? I suppose I have you to thank for that, don't I? How ever will I repay you?
WILLIAM	Seeing you like this is payment enough.
ANNE	Oh, William. You're so... tender.
WILLIAM	This is as it should be, Mother. You and I, together. All of London laid out before us.
ANNE	Ahh, yes. Us.
WILLIAM	First we'll feast. And then the night is yours. The theater perhaps. Dancing... Tell me, what's your pleasure?
ANNE	Pleasure? To take my leave of you, of course.
ANNE	I do feel extraordinary. It's as though I've been given new eyes. I see everything. Understand... (her eyes land on him) Everything.
WILLIAM	Mother-
ANNE	I hate to be cruel - No. I used to hate to be cruel. In life. Now I find it quite freeing. Nothing less will pry your greedy little fingers from my apron strings, will it?
WILLIAM	Stop, please.
ANNE	The way you've clung since the day you first slithered from me. Like a parasite.
WILLIAM	What are you--
ANNE	Had I known, I would have dashed your brains out the moment I saw you. Spared myself a lifetime of tedium.
WILLIAM	Whatever I was... That's not who I am anymore.
ANNE	Darling... It's who you'll always be. A limp, sentimental fool.
BUFFY	What? Why not?
GILES	Because I'm asking you not to.
BUFFY	Sure. Why not. Seems like a nice enough guy.
VAMP	Thanks...?
BUFFY	No problem. You from around here?
GILES	Buffy.
BUFFY	Hey, I'm just saying -- if he's gonna save the world, we should get to know him a little better.
VAMP	My name's Richard.
BUFFY	Hi, Rich.
BUFFY	We've had this conversation before, Giles. When I told you I wouldn't sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory from destroying the world.
GILES	Things are different now, aren't they? After what you've been through. Knowing what you're up against. Faced with the same choice now... you'd let her die.
GILES	No.
BUFFY	Have you heard my speeches?
GILES	That we can't allow any threat that may jeopardize our chances of winning.
BUFFY	Yes. I get it.
WILLIAM	No. I only wanted to make you well.
ANNE	You wanted your hands on me. Perhaps you'd like to finish what you started, hum?
WILLIAM	Please --
ANNE	Come on Willy, have a go before we part. One to remember me by.
WILLIAM	I loved you. I did. Not like this--
ANNE	Just like this. This is what you wanted all along.
WILLIAM	Stop it --
ANNE	Come on. Do it. Who's my little dark prince?
WILLIAM	No!
ANNE	Fine. Then gather up your tears and get out of my house.
WILLIAM	Mother--
ANNE	Get out !
WOOD	What?
SPIKE	I'm sorry.
WOOD	You think "sorry" is gonna make everything right?
SPIKE	Wasn't talking to you.
WOOD	Game?!
SPIKE	She knew what she was signing up for.
WOOD	I didn't sign up for it.
SPIKE	Well, that's the rub, in'it? You didn't sign up for it, and somehow that's my fault.
WOOD	You murdered her.
SPIKE	She sure loved you, didn't she? Enough to risk her life, night after night...
WOOD	You took my childhood... ...when you took her from me. She was all I had. She was my world.
SPIKE	You weren't hers. Doesn't it piss you off?
WOOD	She... She loved me.
SPIKE	So she said, I expect. Not enough to quit, though, was it? Not enough to walk away. For you.
GILES	Spike is a liability, Buffy. He refuses to see that. And so do you. Angel left here because he knew how harmful your relationship with him was. Spike, on the other hand, lacks such self-awareness.
BUFFY	Spike's here because I want him here. We need him. I'm in the fight of my life.
VAMP	Really...?
BUFFY	Not you, Richard.
GILES	You want Spike here even after what he's done to you in the past?
BUFFY	It's different. He has a soul now.
GILES	Yes, and The First seems to be exploiting it to his advantage.
BUFFY	Exactly. The First's doing this. Spike's innocent.
BUFFY	Ben?
GILES	He was a human being, after all. Forced, his whole life, to share his mortal form with a demi-god from a hell-dimension.
BUFFY	Glory. I know. What does that have to do--
GILES	Ben was oblivious to the atrocities Glory committed. No more responsible for her crimes than Spike is to his, when triggered.
BUFFY	Giles...
GILES	I put my hand over his mouth. And as he struggled, weakly... I smothered him. Because it had to be done. (looks at Buffy) He was a liability.
BUFFY	Oh god... You've been stalling me. Keeping me away--
GILES	Buffy, it's time to stop playing the role of a general and start being one.
SPIKE	I gave him a pass. Let him live. On account of the face that I killed his mother.
WOOD	I'm sorry.
BUFFY	I understand... what you tried to do. But she's dead. He killed her.
WOOD	She got herself killed.
BUFFY	And none of it matters. We're preparing to fight a war, and you're looking for revenge on a man who doesn't exist anymore.
WOOD	Don't delude yourself. That man still exists...
BUFFY	Spike's the strongest warrior I have, and we need him if we're going to get through this alive. If you try anything again, he's going to kill you, but more importantly, I'm going to let him.
GILES	I understand your anger... but please believe me when I tell you we did what we did for the good of all --
BUFFY	He's alive, Giles. Spike's alive. Wood failed.
GILES	That changes nothing. What I said to you before is still true. You need to learn --
BUFFY	No...

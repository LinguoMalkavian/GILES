BUFFY	Spike!
GILES	Hey!
SPIKE	You're not The First! GILES You're not in pain!
GILES	What?
SPIKE	Anya said you were The First. Said you were evil. You're supposed to be all, y'know, go-through-able!
GILES	Then why'd you tackle me, you burk? What was that supposed to do?
SPIKE	I... huh... didn't think 'a that.
GILES	And, more importantly... you hit me! Why didn't your chip go off?
SPIKE	Yeah, well..
BUFFY	Well, when we were in the Initiative...
SPIKE	There was a choice...
BUFFY	To repair the chip or just remove it...
GILES	You had it removed?! You removed the chip.
BUFFY	Yeah.
AMANDA	What's a chip?
AHN	(subtitled; in Vietnamese or whatever the actress speaks) I don't understand a word any of you are saying.
GILES	You know this is very dangerous.
BUFFY	You've just heard horror stories, that's all. Wear hoops and they'll catch on something, rip your lobes off, lobes flying everywhere...
GILES	That's not what I mean.
BUFFY	You mean Spike not having a chip. Free-range Spike.
GILES	Buffy, I have to ask. Why on earth did you make that decision?
BUFFY	I guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.
GILES	What? I made that up! I knew the Bringer was behind me because his shoes squeaked! Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these girls safe, and I can't even keep track of the dangers: The First, the Bringers, random demons and now Spike?!
BUFFY	And the principal.
GILES	What?
BUFFY	Oh, nothing much, just, he was in the school basement with a shovel, acting kind of evasive. And he's got a "too charming to be real" thing going on. I'm gonna look into it.
GILES	Well, that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the- loose issue.
BUFFY	Nothing's really changed, Giles. Spike had a chip before, remember? When The First made him kill and sire those people?
GILES	We have no way of knowing if his chip was functioning then. A new chip might be able to restrain him should The First attempt to activate him again.
BUFFY	It doesn't matter. The girls aren't in danger from him. He wouldn't let that happen. I trust him.
GILES	Well, of course you trust Spike. He has slaughtered thousands, and therefore probably knows all about how not to do it.
BUFFY	He has a soul now, Giles. That's what's going to keep him from hurting anyone. I'm going to trust that before I trust some chip we already know can go bad on him.
GILES	Buffy...
BUFFY	He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never going to get there if we never give him a chance.
GILES	I want better for you. Your feelings for him are coloring your judgment. I hear it in your voice. That way lies a future with a great deal of pain. I don't want that for you.
BUFFY	Giles, if you're saying there are sparks between him and me, you're wrong. Spike and I haven't-- things are different since he came back. Just look in his eyes and you'll see he's changed. There's... there's a person in there now.
GILES	I see what's happening. It doesn't matter anymore if you're... if you're physical with each other. There's a connection there. You rely on him and he relies on you. That's what's affecting your judgement.
BUFFY	You think I'm losing sight of the big picture. But I'm not. When Spike had that chip in him it was like, like having him in a muzzle or something. It feels wrong. We can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.
GILES	I hope you're right. You're gambling with a lot of lives.
WILLOW	You're luring me. I know when I'm being lured.
KENNEDY	No, really. It's important.
WILLOW	You're trying to get me alone and, you know, kiss or something...
KENNEDY	And that's not important?
DAWN	Sure, kiss her. What harm can that do?
ANYA	...just left, so I had to walk down the aisle, in the big white dress, to tell everyone the wedding was off. And they were all looking at me with, like, such pity--
ANDREW	I saw the same thing on a Lifetime Movie special event! It was terrible! You were Dixie Carter.
BUFFY	My judgment is clear.
XANDER	Can I help? You seem kinda confused.
MAYA	You aren't wearing a red apron.
XANDER	Confused but sort of randomly observant.
MAYA	Sorry. I just mean... you don't work here, right?
XANDER	Oh, right. No, just helpful. I'm Xander.
MAYA	My name's Maya. And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even figure out if I've got the right kind of rope...
XANDER	That depends what you need it for. Something, like, functional around the house, or you know, recreational? (catching himself) By which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing, not tying someone up for funky sexy fun...
MAYA	I have a kayak.
XANDER	And again with the random. I like it.
MAYA	Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could, sort of, suspend it from the ceiling of the garage with ropes and maybe a pulley or a... winch-thing?
XANDER	Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Want to go bowling with me tonight?
MAYA	What?
XANDER	Oh, you're the only one who gets to be random?
BUFFY	Now, if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be?
WOOD	Buffy?
BUFFY	HEY! Principal Wood! It's you!
WOOD	Looking for something?
BUFFY	YES! File folders! And mechanical pencils. I wanted to write on a file folder with a mechanical pencil.
WOOD	The supply cabinet in the outer office has those things.
BUFFY	Oh... so this isn't the... the supply cabinet. Right. Well, thanks!
WOOD	Hey, Buffy.
BUFFY	Yes?
WOOD	What are you doing tonight?
BUFFY	Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.
WOOD	No, really.
BUFFY	Watching a reality show about a millionaire.
WOOD	Well, then... I'd like to take you out to dinner if that's all right with you.
BUFFY	I'd... sure, I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
WOOD	I'll draw up the paperwork.
WILLOW	He asked you out to dinner?
BUFFY	Yeah. Isn't that weird? He's a principal. A young hot principal with earrings, but a principal. Why do you suppose he asked me out?
WILLOW	Well, I assume it's not 'cause he likes your company.
BUFFY	I don't know. When he looks at me, he's like intense, you know? There's eye contact with all four of our eyes. He could be interested, right?
WILLOW	Sure. You're a frisky vixen.
BUFFY	Or it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing a good job.
WILLOW	Oh. Right. That would make sense too.
BUFFY	Or maybe he knows I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out to kill me.
WILLOW	You'll have to dress for the ambiguity.
BUFFY	It's not even that his behavior's that suspicious. But there he is, right over the Hellmouth all day every day. It's gotta be like being showered with evil, only from underneath.
WILLOW	Not really a shower.
BUFFY	A bidet, then. A bidet of evil.
WILLOW	Can we go back to the eye contact? I mean, Buff, if he really is interested in you... are you interested back?
BUFFY	Good god, how many socks are in there?
WILLOW	They're the Potentials'. Turns out, they each have two feet.
BUFFY	Well we'll see about that when the fighting starts. I didn't mean that.
WILLOW	But you did duck the question. Are you interested in Principal Wood?
BUFFY	Oh, Will. I don't know. He's very good-looking. And funny and solid and... normal, so not the wicked energy, which is nice, because I don't want to be attracted only to the wicked energy... unless he is wicked, in which case, is that why I like him?
WILLOW	I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come 'round again before I jump on.
BUFFY	Anyway, yeah. I like him. And it might be good for me.
WILLOW	Right. You could move on.
BUFFY	Move on? Does everyone in this house think I'm in love with Spike?
WILLOW	I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let someone get close.
BUFFY	Oh--
XANDER	Guys! Guess what happened?
WILLOW	Buffy got a date!
XANDER	No! I did! Fine. Way to steal my thunder.
BUFFY	Sorry. It's Principal Wood and I think he's aligned with The First.
XANDER	Also, like, ten years older than you, right?
WILLOW	Which makes him, like a hundred years younger than your "type."
BUFFY	Yay, someone who doesn't remember the industrial revolution.
WILLOW	I think they're gonna end up making out. "Oh, Principal Wood," she'll gasp, "I love your lack of wicked energy..."
BUFFY	Be quiet, Willow, or we're gonna make you talk about your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think we don't notice.
WILLOW	How 'bout yours, Xander? Is she evil?
XANDER	Well she's interested in me, so there's a good chance. But I'm hoping for the best. We're going bowling and she has a kayak. Hey, that's a lot of socks.
GILES	Dear Lord, I hate that mall. The clerks are rude and everything in the food court is sticky.
WILLOW	Looks like you found her some stuff.
XANDER	That's gotta be rough, getting just, like, pulled outta your home, told you're a Potential Slayer, no chance to bring anything...
GILES	And this language barrier is formidable. I was concerned because my Cantonese's a little... thin... and then it turns out she speaks Vietnamese, which is... thinner. But we muddled though. And, as I suspected, ice-cream is the universal language.
AHN	Like many from Asia, I am lactose- intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable.
BUFFY	What did she say?
GILES	She is grateful to be in a land of plenty. (loudly to Chao-Ann) LET'S GO PUT AWAY THE NEW CLOTHES.
BUFFY	Hey, Will, I wonder if you can do a computer check on Principal Wood for me. See what you can find?
WILLOW	Sure. I'll have the Potentials help out. It'll be a learning exercise. Want me to check out your girl at the same time, Xand?
XANDER	Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why look for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.
ANDREW	"Getting the most out of your new microwave." Ooh, nice. "clock, comma, setting the" page 3...
ANDREW	Oh! Oh! Get thee behind me! I rebuke thee!
FIRST	Look, you monkey...
ANDREW	What do you want from me, Jonathan- slash-The-First?
FIRST	I have an assignment for you. An assignment from beyond the grave.
ANDREW	I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm redeeming myself for killing you... I mean, for killing Jonathan.
FIRST	Really? Why? So you can earn a spot on her little pep squad? You think she'll ever let you in? You're a murderer.
ANDREW	Confidentially, a lot of her people are murderers. Anya and Willow and Spike...
FIRST	Interesting. And you're the only one that she makes seek redemption? Does that seem fair to you?
ANDREW	I guess not.
FIRST	You know we're headed toward a fight, don't you?
ANDREW	Yeah.
FIRST	What do you think the world's gonna be like after that? News flash, there's not gonna be a Slayer-gang anymore. But there is going to be evil. And as long as there is evil, I live. And as long as I live, you can dwell at my side.
ANDREW	That sounds nice.
FIRST	And your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls.
ANDREW	You want me to hurt the girls?
FIRST	Not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya. Not Willow and not your friend Buffy. Just the Potential Slayers.
ANDREW	That's horrible! I'm going to scream and get Buffy in here.
FIRST	She can't see me. I'll still be here, and I'm gonna keep talking 'til you hear what I have to say. So listen up, okay? The girls must die.
ANDREW	I could never do that. All those girls, all that blood. I didn't like the stabbing before.
FIRST	You don't have to stab. This'll be easy. Andrew, think about it. Willow brought something to this house. Something good. Something you can use.
ANDREW	The new microwave.
FIRST	The gun . I want you to think hard. Where did they put the gun?
ANDREW	Hmm.
ANYA	I don't think it's really a date, that's what I think.
BUFFY	Well, it is unclear. That's why I chose a top that says "I'm comfortable in a stodgy office or a swingin' casual setting or killing you because you're a demon."
ANYA	It also says "I spilled grape juice." I'm not sure I can fix this.
BUFFY	Oh, okay.
ANYA	I wasn't talking about your date anyway. I'm talking about this sham date of Xander's. I think this is part of plan to make me jealous.
BUFFY	But it's not working. ANYA Are you nuts? Of course it's working! Observe my bitter ranting! Hear the shrill edge of hysteria in my voice!
BUFFY	Oh. Okay. Look, I've gotta pick out another top...
ANYA	Fine, go. Leave me to stew in my impotent rage.
SPIKE	You look nice.
BUFFY	Oh. Thanks. Traditionally, one wears something over this.
SPIKE	Heard you got a date.
BUFFY	That's not clear, I've got this whole theory about a promotion. Or he's evil.
SPIKE	Buffy, I'm all right.
BUFFY	You don't have to...
SPIKE	What? Be noble? I'm not. I really am all right. You think I still dream of a crypt for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.
BUFFY	Good. I'm glad. Thank you.
SPIKE	Don't care for picket fences anyway. Bloody dangerous.
BUFFY	Right. And, hey... you should do this too. Go out sometime I mean. There was the girl you took to Xander and Anya's not-a-wedding.
SPIKE	Right. There's always girls who like the look. Bad boy, you know, does it for some of 'em.
BUFFY	Sure I can see that. I... gotta go. I don't wanna be late.
XANDER	Maya, hi! I was afraid you weren't coming.
MAYA	We said eight-thirty, right? Did you think I was gonna stand you up?
XANDER	Well, it would be kinda karmic.
MAYA	What?
XANDER	Forget it. I'm glad you're here. You wanna get a lane?
MAYA	Sure. Or we could sit here and make fun of others as they bowl.
XANDER	You don't bowl.
MAYA	Not really. But I am good at pointing and mocking. Are you disappointed?
XANDER	Will you be pointing at or mocking me at any point?
MAYA	Not when you can see me.
XANDER	Then I'm in.
DAWN	Nothing? No records or certificates or college transcripts?
AMANDA	Looks like the only stuff in the system about Principal Robin Wood is super recent. Like, since he moved to Sunnydale.
WILLOW	I've Googled 'til I just can't Google no more. He's not in there.
KENNEDY	Well, that's suspicious.
WILLOW	And it doesn't leave a lot of options. Either this guy has lived completely under the radar his whole life, or he only recently came into existence, or maybe he just took on a new identity, or he's a computer whiz who covered his own tracks.
DAWN	That sounded like kind of a lot of options.
GILES	Anya, calm down. They're educational.
WILLOW	What's this?
ANYA	Giles made them for Chao-Ahn and now she's locked herself in the bathroom. There's a lot of girls up there and they're starting to complain.
GILES	Those are flashcards. I made them to facilitate her training. Chao-Ahn never had a Watcher, and with the language problem...
WILLOW	You showed her these?
GILES	I wanted her to understand the seriousness of her situation.
DAWN	Holy crap.
GILES	Perhaps I'll rethink the approach.
WILLOW	Meantime, you wanna join us in the researchy? We're trying to invade Buffy's date's privacy.
GILES	Buffy has a date?
ANYA	Oh yes, didn't you hear? Everyone has a date. Buffy has a date, Willow's been completely making out with this girl...
KENNEDY	Hey!
ANYA	...and Xander's out with some hardware store whore. It's date-fest two-thousand-and-three!
WILLOW	Buffy's actually investigating Principal Wood. It's not a date.
GILES	Really?
WILLOW	It might be a date.
GILES	For god's sake! How can anyone be thinking about their social life? We're about to fight the original, most primal evil, and these girls are all in mortal danger!
BUFFY	This isn't right.
WOOD	I know it doesn't look promising, but I swear this place is great, the best- kept secret in town. It's just down this way.
BUFFY	Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.
WOOD	I promise, it's just a little further.
BUFFY	You set me up! You son of a what?
WOOD	I guess we should talk.
WOOD	The restaurant's right there.
BUFFY	Uh...
MAYA	And you still have to see her, like, every day?
XANDER	Yeah. But I guess that's good.
MAYA	How is that good? I mean, it sounds like she never lets you forget what happened.
XANDER	Well, it's on her mind right now, I think, because our anniversary just happened. I mean it would've been our anniversary. And maybe I shouldn't be allowed to forget it. I did... It was a bad thing. It hurt her a lot.
MAYA	And if you'd gone ahead with it, married her even though you had doubts... would that've been better?
XANDER	I guess not.
MAYA	It sounds to me like, in the long run, you're both better off. I know it turned out good for me, and that's what really matters, right?
XANDER	Never mind. We're good. I should've taken you on a nicer date than this.
MAYA	Well, I can think of something fun to do.
BUFFY	Ooh, nice place and how the hell did you do that?
WOOD	I've had a little practice. Never took on two at once before, but I've taken out a vamp here or there, and some demons.
BUFFY	Just kinda... freelance?
WOOD	Freelance. Yes, I guess that would be a good way to put it.
BUFFY	And you know who I am?
WOOD	You're the Slayer.
BUFFY	Right. So... I'm guessing you work in an office about fifteen feet over a Hellmouth because you love educational administration.
WOOD	I actually do enjoy the work, but you're right, I maneuvered myself into that school, that office, just- like I maneuvered you there. The Hellmouth draws the bad things in close. And now we're headed for something big, Buffy, and I need to be here when it happens. I want to help.
BUFFY	So I wasn't hired for my counseling skills?
WOOD	They're valuable too.
BUFFY	Why didn't you tell me about you earlier?
WOOD	I wasn't sure about things yet.
BUFFY	You weren't sure you could trust me.
WOOD	No. I wasn't sure I was ready yet. Ready to jump into the fight.
BUFFY	And now you are?
WOOD	Now the fight is starting. Or starting to start. And I don't have time to worry anymore. I have to do something.
BUFFY	You knew I was the Slayer before you got here.
WOOD	Yes.
BUFFY	How? How do you know about Slayers?
WOOD	Right. Okay. See, when I was a little boy I had a mother who was one. The one. The Slayer.
BUFFY	You're-- My god. I didn't know any Slayers had children.
WOOD	I don't know of any others. Anyway, she was killed when I was four. I remember her a little, but it's fuzzy, you know?
BUFFY	Something got her? A demon or a...
WOOD	A vampire. I went through this whole avenging son phase in my twenties, but I never found who did it. So now I just dust as many of 'em as I can find. Figure eventually I'll get him. That's probably why we got jumped. I'm not very popular with the bumpy forehead crowd. Bet you aren't either.
BUFFY	Not most of 'em, no. Are you... do you have Slayer powers? I mean, I just... I'm floored by this... I don't even know what to ask.
WOOD	I don't have powers. No super- strength or mythic responsibilities. Just a guy with a few skills because her Watcher took me in and raised me.
BUFFY	In Beverly Hills.
WOOD	See now, that detail takes the edge off my Little Orphan Robin story, but yeah, that was true.
BUFFY	So you decided to tell me.
WOOD	That's right.
BUFFY	In a darkened little romantic French restaurant.
WOOD	Um, yeah I'm not sure how that happened.
FIRST	Did you find the gun?
ANDREW	Yes. It was in Buffy's underwear drawer. She has nice things.
FIRST	Show me.
ANDREW	Well, I didn't take 'em, but there were thongs and also regular underpants--
FIRST	Show me the gun .
ANDREW	Oh. Here.
FIRST	It's great. There's gonna be panic and fleeing when you start firing, so you're gonna hafta get 'em all trapped somewhere like the basement.
ANDREW	And we're killing them because...
FIRST	Because they're the future of the Slayer line. When they're gone, the line is gone.
ANDREW	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Hey, why not have Spike do it? He's the one with the trigger.
FIRST	It's not time for him yet. You can wait for the next time they're training in the basement. But don't just rely on a locked door to keep 'em in, you'll need more.
ANDREW	Okay. Say, do you have any weaknesses I should know about, if I'm gonna work for you? Like kryptonite or allergies...?
FIRST	What are you asking?
ANDREW	Oh, nothing. Are you made out of the evil impulses of humans? So, like, if everyone was unconscious at the same time, you would fade away?
FIRST	You're asking a lot of questions.
ANDREW	Well, yes. Because I'm evil and I want to do the best I can at that. So I want to know stuff. Like, when do we kill Buffy?
FIRST	Are you wearing a wire?
KENNEDY	What's going on?
WILLOW	The First. It screamed... I think it knows about the wire.
DAWN	I didn't hear that. They're just in the next room.
AMANDA	But you heard it over the wire?
WILLOW	Only that. The whole rest of the time, Andrew's voice is fine, but in between is just silence or static.
DAWN	I guess that's what you'd expect.
AMANDA	Poor Andrew. He must be scared.
FIRST	You think you can trick The First? You think you can squirm free? I hold you, Andrew. I made you do this .
ANDREW	No!
FIRST	This is what you did to him. Took away everything that he was and left him like this. You started down a road with that action. You have to keep going.
ANDREW	Stop looking like Jonathan. You're not him. You're The First and you're trying to get me to shoot innocent girls. But I won't do it. I'm good now and after the fight is over I'm going to pay for killing Jonathan.
FIRST	You're gonna pay for more than that. Know why? Because the biggest, baddest, first evil in the world is angry with you.
WILLOW	I'm hearing something.
KENNEDY	It's not in the headphones. It's out here.
DAWN	Go away!
FIRST	So many dead girls. There will be so many.
XANDER	I knew it. See, I knew it.
MAYA	Thanks for your help selecting the rope. The one I'd picked out wasn't strong enough.
XANDER	Yeah. That would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?
MAYA	Who's Buffy?
XANDER	The Slayer.
MAYA	You know the Slayer?
XANDER	Forget it. Are you affiliated with Vengeance Demons?
MAYA	No.
XANDER	Competitive witches?
MAYA	No.
XANDER	Did you hatch out of a praying mantis egg in the old high school?
MAYA	Gotta say no.
XANDER	This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women are attracted to me!
MAYA	You seemed like a nice guy, that's all. Do the ropes hurt?
XANDER	Yes.
MAYA	Good.
WILLOW	So, we're thinking, it didn't go too well.
DAWN	You shoulda let me do this fast.
ANDREW	No, I hate that. Ooh, ow.
SPIKE	You tried to record the ultimate evil? Why? In a complex effort to royally piss it off?
KENNEDY	Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh?
ANDREW	Oh, god. I never should've gone in wired. Redemption is hard.
GILES	Back to Spike's question. Why did you try to record it?
ANDREW	Ouch.
WILLOW	To study it, see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. Because, guys, we've gotta face it, we know nothing about The First.
ANDREW	Ow. Eep.
ANYA	Well, now we know not to record it. So that's something.
SPIKE	Why'd it appear to... ...this one, then? Thought it was s'posed to be pulling my strings.
ANDREW	It said it wasn't time for you yet.
DAWN	It's okay, Andrew. You did good. You stood up to it, that's really amazing.
ANDREW	Thank you. You're a peach.
ANYA	I wasn't here but I imagine it was a very manly display of hyperventilating. What did it want you to do, anyway?
ANDREW	Shoot all the girls.
DAWN	Shoot girls?
ANDREW	Not you. Just the Potentials.
DAWN	Well that's something anyway. Something tragic .
GILES	This proves my point. This is a crucial time. We need to circle our wagons and stop doing things like going out on dates while there's imminent gunplay! Willow, call Buffy, get her back here. We have to dispose of that gun and figure out our next step.
SPIKE	I can go get her--
WILLOW	I'll call.
AMANDA	Bet that's her. Sometimes you're thinking about calling someone--
WILLOW	No. It's a text message. Oh! It's from Xander. It's one of our signals.
AMANNDA	Signals?
WILLOW	It's a system we set up a while back. Like, codes. This is either the one for "I just got lucky, don't call me for a while" or "my date's a demon who's trying to kill me."
KENNEDY	You don't remember which?
WILLOW	It was long time ago!
DAWN	If we play the percentages...
GILES	Something's eating Xander's head.
ANYA	Say, that's gratifying.
ANDREW	Buffy will know what to do.
SPIKE	I'll go get her--
WILLOW	That's okay.
SPIKE	I'll go get Buffy. She's gonna be worried about the boy.
BUFFY	Oh my God!
BUFFY	Oh my God, this is the best thing I ever had in my mouth.
WOOD	Isn't it good? They soak the pears in brandy. Here, you need a bite with the sauce...
BUFFY	Schpike!
WOOD	Is there a problem?
SPIKE	It's Xander.
MAYA	Well, this is gonna work great.
XANDER	Look, I've... I know what happens if that Seal down there gets all excited. I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into.
MAYA	The Seal opens up and a vicious feral vampire creature comes out. A Turok- Han of my very own.
XANDER	Well, then, you do understand, but what makes you think that's, like, a good idea?
MAYA	The end is coming. The final fight. And everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil.
BUFFY	You sure he's at the high school?
SPIKE	Willow did a locator spell. Useful stuff.
WOOD	I'm not surprised. That school's at the center of everything.
BUFFY	Can't this thing go any faster?
SPIKE	Buffy, he's got it floored.
BUFFY	How much further is it?
WOOD	Ten minutes.
BUFFY	Principal Wood is the son of a Slayer, isn't that interesting?
SPIKE	Yes it is.
BUFFY	Don't see much of that.
WOOD	So, how do you two know each other?
BUFFY	Um, Spike works with me. In the struggle against evil, you know.
WOOD	Cool.
BUFFY	...If she's got him here, it'll be on the Hellmouth, right under us. You got weapons? Not stakes, and not arrows, it's gonna be tight down there. We need blades.
WOOD	My best one. I took out a Durrith Demon with it myself yesterday.
BUFFY	Thanks.
WOOD	Help yourself.
SPIKE	Let's go.
XANDER	Buffy?
WOOD	He's a vampire.
BUFFY	Get Xander!
WOOD	I think your friend's gonna be okay.
BUFFY	Hi, Xand. I'm here.
XANDER	So how's your date going?
ANYA	It's after two. I can't believe Buffy hasn't brought him home yet. His slut ate him up.
WILLOW	His slut didn't eat him up. Besides, I thought you were all angry at him.
ANYA	My feelings are changeable but intense.
ANDREW	I understand your fear, Anya. I know fear myself, you know, because I enraged that primal force.
ANYA	Yes, but you deserve to be in trouble. I didn't kill anybody. Well, not directly or irreversibly. Lately.
GILES	They're still not back?
ANYA	I'm worried. I think we need to go find them. Xander could be injured or trapped or eaten up...
GILES	It is very late. Maybe a little reconnaissance isn't out of the question.
AHN	Why is everyone up? Are the flashcard monsters attacking?
GILES	She says she can't sleep. I MADE MYSELF SOME WARM MILK. YOU CAN HAVE IT!
AHN	You're trying to kill me!
GILES	She's shy.
DAWN	They're back! Here they come!
ANYA	Is Xander all right?
DAWN	He looks okay.
ANYA	Damn him!
WILLOW	What happened?
BUFFY	Principal Wood's a demon-fightin' son of a Slayer.
ANDREW	Neat.
WILLOW	Okay. What happened to Xander?
XANDER	What do you think happened? Another demon woman was attracted to me! But I've got the answer! Willow! Gay me up! C'mon! Let's gay!
WILLOW	What?
XANDER	You heard me. Tell me what to do. I'm mentally undressing Scott Bakula, that's a start, right?
ANDREW	Captain Archer.
XANDER	C'mon Willow, let's get this gay show on the gay road. Help me out here!
BUFFY	What if you just start attracting male demons?
DAWN	Clem always liked you.
ANYA	Serve you right.
GILES	Children. Enough.
XANDER	I'll need stylish new clothes...
GILES	STOP!
SPIKE	Anyone tell you about what happened 'round here tonight?
BUFFY	Willow did. The First is back in the mix.
SPIKES	It talked to the little boy. Said it's not time for me yet.
BUFFY	No. You have to stay.
SPIKE	You got another demon fighter now. Son of a Slayer at that.
BUFFY	That's not why I need you here.
SPIKE	That right? Why's that then?
BUFFY	Because I'm not ready for you not to be here.
SPIKE	And the principal? How's he fit in?
BUFFY	He's a guy on our side. I can't turn away from that. Something tells me I'm gonna need lots of help.
FIRST	You look good.
WOOD	You're not my mother.
FIRST	I give you a compliment and you don't say thank you? Did I raise you that way?
WOOD	You didn't raise me at all.
FIRST	Well, I was dead.
WOOD	You're The First. Why are you here? Why now?
FIRST	'Cause you're coming up in the world. You've been taking the demons out. Makes a mother proud.
WOOD	Think how pleased she'll be when I help take you out. Until it's time for that, I've got no use for you.
FIRST	Would you like to know who killed me?
WOOD	You don't know anything.
FIRST	Is that right? You can check it out after I tell you, check the timing, reread what the witnesses said, the people in the subway station...
WOOD	Who is it?
FIRST	You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
WOOD	Spike.
FIRST	And what do you say?
WOOD	Thank you.
GILES	What?
SPIKE	Anya said you were The First. Said you were evil. You're supposed to be all, y'know, go-through-able!
GILES	Then why'd you tackle me, you burk? What was that supposed to do?
SPIKE	I... huh... didn't think 'a that.
GILES	And, more importantly... you hit me! Why didn't your chip go off?
SPIKE	Yeah, well..
BUFFY	Well, when we were in the Initiative...
SPIKE	There was a choice...
BUFFY	To repair the chip or just remove it...
GILES	You had it removed?! You removed the chip.
BUFFY	Yeah.
GILES	You know this is very dangerous.
BUFFY	You've just heard horror stories, that's all. Wear hoops and they'll catch on something, rip your lobes off, lobes flying everywhere...
GILES	That's not what I mean.
BUFFY	You mean Spike not having a chip. Free-range Spike.
GILES	Buffy, I have to ask. Why on earth did you make that decision?
BUFFY	I guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.
GILES	What? I made that up! I knew the Bringer was behind me because his shoes squeaked! Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these girls safe, and I can't even keep track of the dangers: The First, the Bringers, random demons and now Spike?!
BUFFY	And the principal.
GILES	What?
BUFFY	Oh, nothing much, just, he was in the school basement with a shovel, acting kind of evasive. And he's got a "too charming to be real" thing going on. I'm gonna look into it.
GILES	Well, that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the- loose issue.
BUFFY	Nothing's really changed, Giles. Spike had a chip before, remember? When The First made him kill and sire those people?
GILES	We have no way of knowing if his chip was functioning then. A new chip might be able to restrain him should The First attempt to activate him again.
BUFFY	It doesn't matter. The girls aren't in danger from him. He wouldn't let that happen. I trust him.
GILES	Well, of course you trust Spike. He has slaughtered thousands, and therefore probably knows all about how not to do it.
BUFFY	He has a soul now, Giles. That's what's going to keep him from hurting anyone. I'm going to trust that before I trust some chip we already know can go bad on him.
GILES	Buffy...
BUFFY	He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never going to get there if we never give him a chance.
GILES	I want better for you. Your feelings for him are coloring your judgment. I hear it in your voice. That way lies a future with a great deal of pain. I don't want that for you.
BUFFY	Giles, if you're saying there are sparks between him and me, you're wrong. Spike and I haven't-- things are different since he came back. Just look in his eyes and you'll see he's changed. There's... there's a person in there now.
GILES	I see what's happening. It doesn't matter anymore if you're... if you're physical with each other. There's a connection there. You rely on him and he relies on you. That's what's affecting your judgement.
BUFFY	You think I'm losing sight of the big picture. But I'm not. When Spike had that chip in him it was like, like having him in a muzzle or something. It feels wrong. We can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.
WILLOW	You're luring me. I know when I'm being lured.
KENNEDY	No, really. It's important.
WILLOW	You're trying to get me alone and, you know, kiss or something...
KENNEDY	And that's not important?
ANYA	...just left, so I had to walk down the aisle, in the big white dress, to tell everyone the wedding was off. And they were all looking at me with, like, such pity--
ANDREW	I saw the same thing on a Lifetime Movie special event! It was terrible! You were Dixie Carter.
XANDER	Can I help? You seem kinda confused.
MAYA	You aren't wearing a red apron.
XANDER	Confused but sort of randomly observant.
MAYA	Sorry. I just mean... you don't work here, right?
XANDER	Oh, right. No, just helpful. I'm Xander.
MAYA	My name's Maya. And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even figure out if I've got the right kind of rope...
XANDER	That depends what you need it for. Something, like, functional around the house, or you know, recreational? (catching himself) By which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing, not tying someone up for funky sexy fun...
MAYA	I have a kayak.
XANDER	And again with the random. I like it.
MAYA	Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could, sort of, suspend it from the ceiling of the garage with ropes and maybe a pulley or a... winch-thing?
XANDER	Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Want to go bowling with me tonight?
MAYA	What?
WOOD	Buffy?
BUFFY	HEY! Principal Wood! It's you!
WOOD	Looking for something?
BUFFY	YES! File folders! And mechanical pencils. I wanted to write on a file folder with a mechanical pencil.
WOOD	The supply cabinet in the outer office has those things.
BUFFY	Oh... so this isn't the... the supply cabinet. Right. Well, thanks!
WOOD	Hey, Buffy.
BUFFY	Yes?
WOOD	What are you doing tonight?
BUFFY	Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.
WOOD	No, really.
BUFFY	Watching a reality show about a millionaire.
WOOD	Well, then... I'd like to take you out to dinner if that's all right with you.
BUFFY	I'd... sure, I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
WOOD	I'll draw up the paperwork.
WILLOW	He asked you out to dinner?
BUFFY	Yeah. Isn't that weird? He's a principal. A young hot principal with earrings, but a principal. Why do you suppose he asked me out?
WILLOW	Well, I assume it's not 'cause he likes your company.
BUFFY	I don't know. When he looks at me, he's like intense, you know? There's eye contact with all four of our eyes. He could be interested, right?
WILLOW	Sure. You're a frisky vixen.
BUFFY	Or it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing a good job.
WILLOW	Oh. Right. That would make sense too.
BUFFY	Or maybe he knows I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out to kill me.
WILLOW	You'll have to dress for the ambiguity.
BUFFY	It's not even that his behavior's that suspicious. But there he is, right over the Hellmouth all day every day. It's gotta be like being showered with evil, only from underneath.
WILLOW	Not really a shower.
BUFFY	A bidet, then. A bidet of evil.
WILLOW	Can we go back to the eye contact? I mean, Buff, if he really is interested in you... are you interested back?
WILLOW	They're the Potentials'. Turns out, they each have two feet.
BUFFY	Well we'll see about that when the fighting starts. I didn't mean that.
WILLOW	But you did duck the question. Are you interested in Principal Wood?
BUFFY	Oh, Will. I don't know. He's very good-looking. And funny and solid and... normal, so not the wicked energy, which is nice, because I don't want to be attracted only to the wicked energy... unless he is wicked, in which case, is that why I like him?
WILLOW	I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come 'round again before I jump on.
BUFFY	Anyway, yeah. I like him. And it might be good for me.
WILLOW	Right. You could move on.
BUFFY	Move on? Does everyone in this house think I'm in love with Spike?
WILLOW	I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let someone get close.
BUFFY	Oh--
XANDER	Guys! Guess what happened?
WILLOW	Buffy got a date!
XANDER	No! I did! Fine. Way to steal my thunder.
BUFFY	Sorry. It's Principal Wood and I think he's aligned with The First.
XANDER	Also, like, ten years older than you, right?
WILLOW	Which makes him, like a hundred years younger than your "type."
BUFFY	Yay, someone who doesn't remember the industrial revolution.
WILLOW	I think they're gonna end up making out. "Oh, Principal Wood," she'll gasp, "I love your lack of wicked energy..."
BUFFY	Be quiet, Willow, or we're gonna make you talk about your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think we don't notice.
WILLOW	How 'bout yours, Xander? Is she evil?
XANDER	Well she's interested in me, so there's a good chance. But I'm hoping for the best. We're going bowling and she has a kayak. Hey, that's a lot of socks.
GILES	Dear Lord, I hate that mall. The clerks are rude and everything in the food court is sticky.
WILLOW	Looks like you found her some stuff.
XANDER	That's gotta be rough, getting just, like, pulled outta your home, told you're a Potential Slayer, no chance to bring anything...
GILES	And this language barrier is formidable. I was concerned because my Cantonese's a little... thin... and then it turns out she speaks Vietnamese, which is... thinner. But we muddled though. And, as I suspected, ice-cream is the universal language.
AHN	Like many from Asia, I am lactose- intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable.
BUFFY	What did she say?
GILES	She is grateful to be in a land of plenty. (loudly to Chao-Ann) LET'S GO PUT AWAY THE NEW CLOTHES.
BUFFY	Hey, Will, I wonder if you can do a computer check on Principal Wood for me. See what you can find?
WILLOW	Sure. I'll have the Potentials help out. It'll be a learning exercise. Want me to check out your girl at the same time, Xand?
XANDER	Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why look for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.
ANDREW	"Getting the most out of your new microwave." Ooh, nice. "clock, comma, setting the" page 3...
ANDREW	Oh! Oh! Get thee behind me! I rebuke thee!
ANDREW	What do you want from me, Jonathan- slash-The-First?
FIRST	I have an assignment for you. An assignment from beyond the grave.
ANDREW	I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm redeeming myself for killing you... I mean, for killing Jonathan.
FIRST	Really? Why? So you can earn a spot on her little pep squad? You think she'll ever let you in? You're a murderer.
ANDREW	Confidentially, a lot of her people are murderers. Anya and Willow and Spike...
FIRST	Interesting. And you're the only one that she makes seek redemption? Does that seem fair to you?
ANDREW	I guess not.
FIRST	You know we're headed toward a fight, don't you?
ANDREW	Yeah.
FIRST	What do you think the world's gonna be like after that? News flash, there's not gonna be a Slayer-gang anymore. But there is going to be evil. And as long as there is evil, I live. And as long as I live, you can dwell at my side.
ANDREW	That sounds nice.
FIRST	And your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls.
ANDREW	You want me to hurt the girls?
FIRST	Not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya. Not Willow and not your friend Buffy. Just the Potential Slayers.
ANDREW	That's horrible! I'm going to scream and get Buffy in here.
ANDREW	I could never do that. All those girls, all that blood. I didn't like the stabbing before.
FIRST	You don't have to stab. This'll be easy. Andrew, think about it. Willow brought something to this house. Something good. Something you can use.
ANDREW	The new microwave.
FIRST	The gun . I want you to think hard. Where did they put the gun?
ANYA	I don't think it's really a date, that's what I think.
BUFFY	Well, it is unclear. That's why I chose a top that says "I'm comfortable in a stodgy office or a swingin' casual setting or killing you because you're a demon."
ANYA	It also says "I spilled grape juice." I'm not sure I can fix this.
BUFFY	Oh, okay.
ANYA	I wasn't talking about your date anyway. I'm talking about this sham date of Xander's. I think this is part of plan to make me jealous.
BUFFY	But it's not working. ANYA Are you nuts? Of course it's working! Observe my bitter ranting! Hear the shrill edge of hysteria in my voice!
BUFFY	Oh. Okay. Look, I've gotta pick out another top...
ANYA	Fine, go. Leave me to stew in my impotent rage.
SPIKE	You look nice.
BUFFY	Oh. Thanks. Traditionally, one wears something over this.
SPIKE	Heard you got a date.
BUFFY	That's not clear, I've got this whole theory about a promotion. Or he's evil.
SPIKE	Buffy, I'm all right.
BUFFY	You don't have to...
SPIKE	What? Be noble? I'm not. I really am all right. You think I still dream of a crypt for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.
BUFFY	Good. I'm glad. Thank you.
SPIKE	Don't care for picket fences anyway. Bloody dangerous.
BUFFY	Right. And, hey... you should do this too. Go out sometime I mean. There was the girl you took to Xander and Anya's not-a-wedding.
SPIKE	Right. There's always girls who like the look. Bad boy, you know, does it for some of 'em.
BUFFY	Sure I can see that. I... gotta go. I don't wanna be late.
XANDER	Maya, hi! I was afraid you weren't coming.
MAYA	We said eight-thirty, right? Did you think I was gonna stand you up?
XANDER	Well, it would be kinda karmic.
MAYA	What?
XANDER	Forget it. I'm glad you're here. You wanna get a lane?
MAYA	Sure. Or we could sit here and make fun of others as they bowl.
XANDER	You don't bowl.
MAYA	Not really. But I am good at pointing and mocking. Are you disappointed?
XANDER	Will you be pointing at or mocking me at any point?
MAYA	Not when you can see me.
XANDER	Then I'm in.
DAWN	Nothing? No records or certificates or college transcripts?
AMANDA	Looks like the only stuff in the system about Principal Robin Wood is super recent. Like, since he moved to Sunnydale.
WILLOW	I've Googled 'til I just can't Google no more. He's not in there.
KENNEDY	Well, that's suspicious.
WILLOW	And it doesn't leave a lot of options. Either this guy has lived completely under the radar his whole life, or he only recently came into existence, or maybe he just took on a new identity, or he's a computer whiz who covered his own tracks.
WILLOW	What's this?
ANYA	Giles made them for Chao-Ahn and now she's locked herself in the bathroom. There's a lot of girls up there and they're starting to complain.
GILES	Those are flashcards. I made them to facilitate her training. Chao-Ahn never had a Watcher, and with the language problem...
WILLOW	You showed her these?
DAWN	Holy crap.
GILES	Perhaps I'll rethink the approach.
WILLOW	Meantime, you wanna join us in the researchy? We're trying to invade Buffy's date's privacy.
GILES	Buffy has a date?
ANYA	Oh yes, didn't you hear? Everyone has a date. Buffy has a date, Willow's been completely making out with this girl...
KENNEDY	Hey!
ANYA	...and Xander's out with some hardware store whore. It's date-fest two-thousand-and-three!
WILLOW	Buffy's actually investigating Principal Wood. It's not a date.
GILES	Really?
WILLOW	It might be a date.
GILES	For god's sake! How can anyone be thinking about their social life? We're about to fight the original, most primal evil, and these girls are all in mortal danger!
BUFFY	This isn't right.
WOOD	I know it doesn't look promising, but I swear this place is great, the best- kept secret in town. It's just down this way.
BUFFY	Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.
WOOD	I promise, it's just a little further.
MAYA	And you still have to see her, like, every day?
XANDER	Yeah. But I guess that's good.
MAYA	How is that good? I mean, it sounds like she never lets you forget what happened.
XANDER	Well, it's on her mind right now, I think, because our anniversary just happened. I mean it would've been our anniversary. And maybe I shouldn't be allowed to forget it. I did... It was a bad thing. It hurt her a lot.
MAYA	And if you'd gone ahead with it, married her even though you had doubts... would that've been better?
XANDER	I guess not.
MAYA	It sounds to me like, in the long run, you're both better off. I know it turned out good for me, and that's what really matters, right?
XANDER	Never mind. We're good. I should've taken you on a nicer date than this.
BUFFY	Ooh, nice place and how the hell did you do that?
WOOD	I've had a little practice. Never took on two at once before, but I've taken out a vamp here or there, and some demons.
BUFFY	Just kinda... freelance?
WOOD	Freelance. Yes, I guess that would be a good way to put it.
BUFFY	And you know who I am?
WOOD	You're the Slayer.
BUFFY	Right. So... I'm guessing you work in an office about fifteen feet over a Hellmouth because you love educational administration.
WOOD	I actually do enjoy the work, but you're right, I maneuvered myself into that school, that office, just- like I maneuvered you there. The Hellmouth draws the bad things in close. And now we're headed for something big, Buffy, and I need to be here when it happens. I want to help.
BUFFY	So I wasn't hired for my counseling skills?
WOOD	They're valuable too.
BUFFY	Why didn't you tell me about you earlier?
WOOD	I wasn't sure about things yet.
BUFFY	You weren't sure you could trust me.
WOOD	No. I wasn't sure I was ready yet. Ready to jump into the fight.
BUFFY	And now you are?
WOOD	Now the fight is starting. Or starting to start. And I don't have time to worry anymore. I have to do something.
BUFFY	You knew I was the Slayer before you got here.
WOOD	Yes.
BUFFY	How? How do you know about Slayers?
WOOD	Right. Okay. See, when I was a little boy I had a mother who was one. The one. The Slayer.
BUFFY	You're-- My god. I didn't know any Slayers had children.
WOOD	I don't know of any others. Anyway, she was killed when I was four. I remember her a little, but it's fuzzy, you know?
BUFFY	Something got her? A demon or a...
WOOD	A vampire. I went through this whole avenging son phase in my twenties, but I never found who did it. So now I just dust as many of 'em as I can find. Figure eventually I'll get him. That's probably why we got jumped. I'm not very popular with the bumpy forehead crowd. Bet you aren't either.
BUFFY	Not most of 'em, no. Are you... do you have Slayer powers? I mean, I just... I'm floored by this... I don't even know what to ask.
WOOD	I don't have powers. No super- strength or mythic responsibilities. Just a guy with a few skills because her Watcher took me in and raised me.
BUFFY	In Beverly Hills.
WOOD	See now, that detail takes the edge off my Little Orphan Robin story, but yeah, that was true.
BUFFY	So you decided to tell me.
WOOD	That's right.
BUFFY	In a darkened little romantic French restaurant.
WOOD	Um, yeah I'm not sure how that happened.
FIRST	Did you find the gun?
ANDREW	Yes. It was in Buffy's underwear drawer. She has nice things.
FIRST	Show me.
ANDREW	Well, I didn't take 'em, but there were thongs and also regular underpants--
FIRST	Show me the gun .
ANDREW	Oh. Here.
FIRST	It's great. There's gonna be panic and fleeing when you start firing, so you're gonna hafta get 'em all trapped somewhere like the basement.
ANDREW	And we're killing them because...
FIRST	Because they're the future of the Slayer line. When they're gone, the line is gone.
ANDREW	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Hey, why not have Spike do it? He's the one with the trigger.
FIRST	It's not time for him yet. You can wait for the next time they're training in the basement. But don't just rely on a locked door to keep 'em in, you'll need more.
ANDREW	Okay. Say, do you have any weaknesses I should know about, if I'm gonna work for you? Like kryptonite or allergies...?
FIRST	What are you asking?
FIRST	You're asking a lot of questions.
ANDREW	Well, yes. Because I'm evil and I want to do the best I can at that. So I want to know stuff. Like, when do we kill Buffy?
FIRST	Are you wearing a wire?
KENNEDY	What's going on?
WILLOW	The First. It screamed... I think it knows about the wire.
DAWN	I didn't hear that. They're just in the next room.
AMANDA	But you heard it over the wire?
WILLOW	Only that. The whole rest of the time, Andrew's voice is fine, but in between is just silence or static.
DAWN	I guess that's what you'd expect.
AMANDA	Poor Andrew. He must be scared.
ANDREW	No!
ANDREW	Stop looking like Jonathan. You're not him. You're The First and you're trying to get me to shoot innocent girls. But I won't do it. I'm good now and after the fight is over I'm going to pay for killing Jonathan.
FIRST	You're gonna pay for more than that. Know why? Because the biggest, baddest, first evil in the world is angry with you.
WILLOW	I'm hearing something.
KENNEDY	It's not in the headphones. It's out here.
DAWN	Go away!
FIRST	So many dead girls. There will be so many.
XANDER	I knew it. See, I knew it.
MAYA	Thanks for your help selecting the rope. The one I'd picked out wasn't strong enough.
XANDER	Yeah. That would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?
MAYA	Who's Buffy?
XANDER	The Slayer.
MAYA	You know the Slayer?
XANDER	Forget it. Are you affiliated with Vengeance Demons?
MAYA	No.
XANDER	Competitive witches?
MAYA	No.
XANDER	Did you hatch out of a praying mantis egg in the old high school?
MAYA	Gotta say no.
XANDER	This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women are attracted to me!
MAYA	You seemed like a nice guy, that's all. Do the ropes hurt?
XANDER	Yes.
MAYA	Good.
DAWN	You shoulda let me do this fast.
ANDREW	No, I hate that. Ooh, ow.
SPIKE	You tried to record the ultimate evil? Why? In a complex effort to royally piss it off?
KENNEDY	Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh?
ANDREW	Oh, god. I never should've gone in wired. Redemption is hard.
GILES	Back to Spike's question. Why did you try to record it?
ANDREW	Ouch.
WILLOW	To study it, see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. Because, guys, we've gotta face it, we know nothing about The First.
ANDREW	Ow. Eep.
ANYA	Well, now we know not to record it. So that's something.
SPIKE	Why'd it appear to... ...this one, then? Thought it was s'posed to be pulling my strings.
DAWN	It's okay, Andrew. You did good. You stood up to it, that's really amazing.
ANDREW	Thank you. You're a peach.
ANYA	I wasn't here but I imagine it was a very manly display of hyperventilating. What did it want you to do, anyway?
ANDREW	Shoot all the girls.
DAWN	Shoot girls?
ANDREW	Not you. Just the Potentials.
DAWN	Well that's something anyway. Something tragic .
GILES	This proves my point. This is a crucial time. We need to circle our wagons and stop doing things like going out on dates while there's imminent gunplay! Willow, call Buffy, get her back here. We have to dispose of that gun and figure out our next step.
SPIKE	I can go get her--
WILLOW	I'll call.
AMANDA	Bet that's her. Sometimes you're thinking about calling someone--
WILLOW	No. It's a text message. Oh! It's from Xander. It's one of our signals.
AMANNDA	Signals?
WILLOW	It's a system we set up a while back. Like, codes. This is either the one for "I just got lucky, don't call me for a while" or "my date's a demon who's trying to kill me."
KENNEDY	You don't remember which?
WILLOW	It was long time ago!
DAWN	If we play the percentages...
GILES	Something's eating Xander's head.
ANYA	Say, that's gratifying.
ANDREW	Buffy will know what to do.
SPIKE	I'll go get her--
SPIKE	I'll go get Buffy. She's gonna be worried about the boy.
BUFFY	Oh my God, this is the best thing I ever had in my mouth.
WOOD	Isn't it good? They soak the pears in brandy. Here, you need a bite with the sauce...
WOOD	Is there a problem?
MAYA	Well, this is gonna work great.
XANDER	Look, I've... I know what happens if that Seal down there gets all excited. I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into.
MAYA	The Seal opens up and a vicious feral vampire creature comes out. A Turok- Han of my very own.
XANDER	Well, then, you do understand, but what makes you think that's, like, a good idea?
MAYA	The end is coming. The final fight. And everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil.
BUFFY	You sure he's at the high school?
SPIKE	Willow did a locator spell. Useful stuff.
WOOD	I'm not surprised. That school's at the center of everything.
BUFFY	Can't this thing go any faster?
SPIKE	Buffy, he's got it floored.
BUFFY	How much further is it?
WOOD	Ten minutes.
BUFFY	Principal Wood is the son of a Slayer, isn't that interesting?
SPIKE	Yes it is.
BUFFY	Don't see much of that.
WOOD	So, how do you two know each other?
BUFFY	Um, Spike works with me. In the struggle against evil, you know.
WOOD	Cool.
BUFFY	Hi, Xand. I'm here.
XANDER	So how's your date going?
ANYA	It's after two. I can't believe Buffy hasn't brought him home yet. His slut ate him up.
WILLOW	His slut didn't eat him up. Besides, I thought you were all angry at him.
ANYA	My feelings are changeable but intense.
ANDREW	I understand your fear, Anya. I know fear myself, you know, because I enraged that primal force.
ANYA	Yes, but you deserve to be in trouble. I didn't kill anybody. Well, not directly or irreversibly. Lately.
GILES	They're still not back?
ANYA	I'm worried. I think we need to go find them. Xander could be injured or trapped or eaten up...
GILES	It is very late. Maybe a little reconnaissance isn't out of the question.
AHN	Why is everyone up? Are the flashcard monsters attacking?
GILES	She says she can't sleep. I MADE MYSELF SOME WARM MILK. YOU CAN HAVE IT!
AHN	You're trying to kill me!
GILES	She's shy.
ANYA	Is Xander all right?
DAWN	He looks okay.
ANYA	Damn him!
WILLOW	What happened?
BUFFY	Principal Wood's a demon-fightin' son of a Slayer.
ANDREW	Neat.
WILLOW	Okay. What happened to Xander?
XANDER	What do you think happened? Another demon woman was attracted to me! But I've got the answer! Willow! Gay me up! C'mon! Let's gay!
WILLOW	What?
XANDER	You heard me. Tell me what to do. I'm mentally undressing Scott Bakula, that's a start, right?
ANDREW	Captain Archer.
XANDER	C'mon Willow, let's get this gay show on the gay road. Help me out here!
BUFFY	What if you just start attracting male demons?
DAWN	Clem always liked you.
ANYA	Serve you right.
GILES	Children. Enough.
XANDER	I'll need stylish new clothes...
GILES	STOP!
SPIKE	Anyone tell you about what happened 'round here tonight?
BUFFY	Willow did. The First is back in the mix.
SPIKES	It talked to the little boy. Said it's not time for me yet.
BUFFY	No. You have to stay.
SPIKE	You got another demon fighter now. Son of a Slayer at that.
BUFFY	That's not why I need you here.
SPIKE	That right? Why's that then?
BUFFY	Because I'm not ready for you not to be here.
SPIKE	And the principal? How's he fit in?
BUFFY	He's a guy on our side. I can't turn away from that. Something tells me I'm gonna need lots of help.
WOOD	You're not my mother.
FIRST	I give you a compliment and you don't say thank you? Did I raise you that way?
WOOD	You didn't raise me at all.
FIRST	Well, I was dead.
WOOD	You're The First. Why are you here? Why now?
FIRST	'Cause you're coming up in the world. You've been taking the demons out. Makes a mother proud.
WOOD	Think how pleased she'll be when I help take you out. Until it's time for that, I've got no use for you.
WOOD	You don't know anything.
FIRST	Is that right? You can check it out after I tell you, check the timing, reread what the witnesses said, the people in the subway station...
WOOD	Who is it?
FIRST	You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
FIRST	And what do you say?
WOOD	Thank you.

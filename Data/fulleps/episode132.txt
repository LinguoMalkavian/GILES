XANDER	It's a loop. Like the mummy hand. I'm doomed to replace these windows for all eternity. Maybe we should just board these up until things are less Hell-mouthy.
ANYA	Nothing. And nothing. And the Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...
WILLOW	Yeah, my searches aren't turning anything up either. Are you sure this thing called itself The First?
BUFFY	Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before everything else-
ANYA	Please. How many times did I hear that line in my demon days. "I'm so rotten they don't even have a name for it... I'm baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?" Or terrified. Whatever.
BUFFY	It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing before... I felt it. It was ancient and... enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue Spike soon, who knows what else The First will get him to do.
XANDER	I wish Sleeping Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.
ANYA	Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky swat attacked. Said The First was holed up at the Seal of Dan... Zal... Something.
DAWN	Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to answer any more questions.
BUFFY	Dawn-
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	Just - he'll come to when he comes to... Keep reading, okay? If we want to help Spike, we need to know how to fight this thing.
DAWN	Anya gets to hit him.
WILLOW	Here's something!
BUFFY	Hand me the Watcher's Codex again?
BUFFY	Mom?
JOYCE	Okay. Is that slang, like - "you're not for real?" Or-
BUFFY	You're The First.
JOYCE	You're so tired, baby. You're not making sense. Maybe you should get some sleep-
BUFFY	No-
JOYCE	You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.
BUFFY	Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.
JOYCE	I don't want to scare you. But I want you to take care. You need to wake up.
BUFFY	What?
XANDER	Wake up, Buff.
BUFFY	Did you see it?
XANDER	There's nothing to see. You were doing a little dream talking, that's all.
BUFFY	Oh.
XANDER	You okay? What did you see?
BUFFY	Nothing. It was nothing.
FIRST	Always liked that, didn't you?
FIRST	Kick a dolly when he's down. That was your style.
ANYA	That was something.
DAWN	Maybe if you threw hot water on him.
ANYA	Good thinking.
DAWN	Nothing.
BUFFY	What?
DAWN	Oh - I thought you were going to ask what we were doing-
BUFFY	No, I-
DAWN	Look who's awake!
ANYA	Silly Andrew you drooled all over yourself.
ANDREW	I'm - I was about to be dead, You saved me.
BUFFY	For the time being. But if you don't tell us what we need to know - I'm going to offer you to The First on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.
ANDREW	The first what?
ANYA	It's the name of the evil thing that pretended to be Warren and got you to kill Jonathan.
ANDREW	Ah. Not very ominous sounding.
DAWN	It is if you understand the context-
ANDREW	No, an evil name should be, like, Lex or Voldemort or-
BUFFY	Hey. I was intimidating here.
ANDREW	Oh - sorry. Go ahead.
BUFFY	Forget it. Where's the Seal?
ANDREW	It's around that corner. I think.
BUFFY	Better be right this time.
ANDREW	I told you I wasn't sure-
XANDER	Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of the-
BUFFY	What does it do?
ANDREW	I don't know. Something not good. It didn't work 'cause... There wasn't enough blood- (tries to leave) Okay.
DAWN	Looks like The First made another Sacrifice. Or a music video.
BUFFY	The Seal could have been activated. Maybe that's what The First wanted Spike for.
ANDREW	That was not there before. I had nothing to do with that.
XANDER	Thanks for clearing that up. 'Cause otherwise we might have thought you were up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend .
ANDREW	He's in a place of joy and peace. He told me.
XANDER	No. Nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost-
BUFFY	Guys-
ANDREW	Man, this place gives me the creeps. It's like in Wonder Woman, issue 297- 299-
XANDER	"Catacombs" Yeah. With the skeleton.
XANDER	That was cool ANDREW That was cool.
XANDER	This way. Move it.
DAWN	So what next? We found the Seal but no Spike...
BUFFY	I'm not sure. The First was camped underground last time I found it, but who knows-
WOOD	Buffy
BUFFY	Hey-
WOOD	I thought you were-
DAWN	Sick! She was. Vomiting and... oozing from various places. And-
WOOD	I remember. Please don't go on.
DAWN	But now - it's amazing. The doctor gave her some-
BUFFY	Pills. DAWN Cream.
BUFFY	Anyway I'm all better now.
WOOD	Oh - yeah. Somebody left it in the courtyard. I was just returning it.
BUFFY	That's some full service Principal- ing. Wow.
WOOD	I try.
BUFFY	Oh. And... I was just down here helping Dawnie with her project.
DAWN	For science.
BUFFY	We buried a... time capsule.
DAWN	Hello people of the future! Kids now like Red Bull and Jackass!
BUFFY	Okay. We'd better go.
WOOD	Buffy. If you are feeling better - I'd like you back at work. I've been wait-listing students who want to see you.
BUFFY	Right. Sorry about that. I've just been ill and... stuff.
WOOD	It's fine. I understand. But things are backing up.
BUFFY	No problem. I'll be back tomorrow. One-hundred percent ooze-free me.
WOOD	Good.
XANDER	How's it going?
BUFFY	Dawn's trying to find anything she can on the Seal of Danzalthar and Will's going to do a locator spell, see if she can find The First.
XANDER	Why don't you go get some rest? You've been up for, like, two days. We'll call you if we find anything.
BUFFY	I couldn't sleep. Too much going on.
XANDER	It'll be okay, Buff. We've faced this kind of stuff before.
BUFFY	You didn't see The First. I did. I felt it. This thing is-
FIRST	You only make me stronger.
BUFFY	Will-
WILLOW	I feel it. It's still in me...
BUFFY	It's not, it's gone. You're okay.
WILLOW	I don't want to hurt anybody, Buffy. Don't let it make me. Oh, God...
BUFFY	I won't. You're okay. We just, we won't use magic to fight this thing. Not until we know what we're doing.
WILLOW	I can't. I can't. I'm sorry...
XANDER	At least let me come with you.
BUFFY	I'm going alone.
XANDER	You said yourself you don't know how to fight The First. Or even where it is.
BUFFY	It's out there - and it's hurting my friends. I'll find it-
GILES	Buffy.
BUFFY	Giles?
MOLLY	Nice place. Bit of a mess.
KENNEDY	This is the Slayer? Huh.
GILES	Sorry to barge in. I'm afraid we have a slight apocalypse.
DAWN	They're all Slayers?
GILES	Potential Slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them, all over the world. Now there's only a handful - and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
BUFFY	The others were murdered.
GILES	As well as their Watchers.
BUFFY	The First - that's what it wants.
GILES	Yes. To erase all the Slayers-in- training and their Watchers, along with their methods...
BUFFY	And then Faith. Then me. And with all the potentials gone, and no way of making another... It's the end. There's no more Slayer. Ever.
WILLOW	We haven't been able to find anything on The First. No documentation.
GILES	That's because it pre-dates written history... And it rarely shows its true face. The only record of it I know was in the library of the Council.
ANYA	What about the Council? What do they say about this?
GILES	Gone.
WILLOW	What?
GILES	Obliterated. They were in session... There was an explosion.
WILLOW	So all the records are destroyed?
GILES	Annabelle-
ANYA	And blew the Council up? See, that's what happens when you're all stuffy and repressed - you over-react.
GILES	Not - I didn't... It must have been an agent of The First, after my little burglary session. The knowledge in the files had to be protected. There wasn't time for bureaucracy or debate, but the Council knows no other way.
ANDREW	Go on.
BUFFY	Can we gag him?
GILES	Very little. It can change form, but only appears in the guise of people who've passed away.
WILLOW	Our "ghosts."
GILES	Also, it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It works through the people it manipulates and its followers, The Bringers-
KENNEDY	Those freaks in the black robes.
MOLLY	Yeah. With the hoodies and the crazy alphabet eyes. I didn't see. I just heard that-
ANNABELLE	Shhh. Molly. Mr. Giles doesn't need us prattling on...
GILES	The First is unlike anything we've faced before. There's evil, and then there's the thing that made evil... The source.
BUFFY	And that's what this claims to be?
GILES	That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. To defeat it... Honestly, I don't know... but we have to find a way. If the Slayer line is eliminated, then the Hellmouth will have no guardian. The balance will be destroyed... It falls to you, Buffy. We'll do what we can - but only you have the strength to protect these girls - and the world - against what's coming.
XANDER	But no pressure.
KENNEDY	That's it? That's the plan?
GILES	Of course, we'll use all our resources, but-
KENNEDY	And if this thing is the root of all Evil, isn't the Hellmouth it's number one vacation spot? Don't you think we should be hiding our asses away on the other side of the globe?
ANNABELLE	Kennedy-
BUFFY	No, she's not wrong. We should have more muscle. That's why we have to find Spike.
ANYA	Yeah, he'll help. If he's not crazy. Or killing people. Or dead. Or, you know, all of tile above.
FIRST	That's why our kind make such good dollies.
GILES	This place, where you last saw The First, you say it was in a Christmas tree lot?
BUFFY	Under it. There was a hidden cavern, happened to be under a tree lot. Those Bringer guys were doing some kind of ritual.
I	mean, a new kind of bad.
GILES	Just in time for Christmas.
BUFFY	I didn't even realize it was December. Maybe when we get home we should decorate the rubble. You think you'll ever show up for a real visit? The kind where the world isn't about to end?
GILES	If we survive this, I promise to.
BUFFY	Good. 'Cause I miss you.
GILES	I miss you too.
ANDREW	So, how long have you followed Buffy?
XANDER	I don't "follow" her. She's my best friend.
ANDREW	Huh. She seems like a good leader. Her hair is shiny. Does she make you stab things?
WILLOW	Annabelle can sleep here, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room-
KENNEDY	Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep. Molly'll talk her ear off.
WILLOW	Okay, then Molly down here, you with Dawn and Annabelle with me.
KENNEDY	Bad idea. Annabelle snores.
WILLOW	You want to do the sleeping arrangements?
KENNEDY	Okay. You better not hog the covers.
DAWN	Does she wanna eat?
WILLOW	What? Huh? She's - she's new.
DAWN	Well Annabelle and Molly are starved and I totally burned the mac and cheese.
WILLOW	Or we can order a pizza.
ANNABELLE	As long as it's plain. I'm veggie-
MOLLY	Daft, you mean-
ANNABELLE	Just because you'll eat any kind of trash-
MOLLY	Brill! Biscuits.
DAWN	Knock yourself out. I feel a cookie problem coming on myself.
GILES	So there was an entrance to the cave above ground here?
BUFFY	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
GILES	So we'll just keep-
GILES	Good lord, are you alright?
BUFFY	Peachy. Except my knees bend backwards now. Stay up there, Giles. I'll check it out.
GILES	It's gone.
BUFFY	What was it?
BUFFY	Don't want to wake the others just yet, give us a chance to...
KENNEDY	Sorry about the British invasion.
MOLLY	We've been up for hours.
ANNABELLE	Four p.m. London time.
KENNEDY	You all right? You look...
BUFFY	I'm fine. Got in a fight, is all.
GILES	Yes. But, Buffy, are you sure we shouldn't discuss this privately?
BUFFY	You mean not in front of the Next Generation?
GILES	What you fought was a vampire. But something more as well. It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, Turok-Han are to vampires. They're ancient, primordial, ferociously strong killing machines which live off blood, single-minded as animals. They are the vampires vampires fear. And until this morning, I thought they were myth.
ANNABELLE	Did you slay it?
BUFFY	No. It's still out there. Somewhere.
MOLLY	What does it want?
BUFFY	All of us dead.
GILES	Then until sunset, Buffy, you should rest. A few hours sleep will make a world of difference.
BUFFY	No sleep today. Can't.
GILES	But you're exhausted.
BUFFY	Comes with the gig. I don't think taking on pre-historic evil involves nap time.
GILES	Buffy - how exactly do you plan to research something as widespread as The First?
BUFFY	I have the best plan ever.
BUFFY	You know, maybe the First isn't ready for modern technology... "Results one through ten out of nine hundred thousand, five hundred, seventeen." Okay. I gotta narrow this down - I'll call you back.
WOOD	"...In the Movies." (to Buffy) You're looking for evil movies?
BUFFY	I know it's not the all-time most Kosher use of office hours, but, uh, I'm facing a little downtime here and what can I say? I just love those evil, evil movies. Like "The Exorcist" or "Blair Witch".
WOOD	As opposed to, say, Rob Schneider's oeuvre.
BUFFY	Different evil.
WOOD	You okay? You've looked better.
BUFFY	Well, this isn't for the kids...
WOOD	Yeah, yeah... I'm only saying that once you see true Evil, it can have some serious afterburn. And then you can't unsee what you saw. Ever.
BUFFY	What kind of movies do you like?
WOOD	Me? Mysteries. I love finding out what's underneath it all in the end.
FIRST	A fun and funny game, without all the rules. Or any of that bothersome winning part. But, still, there are sides. You have to choose a side, Spike.
SPIKE	You're not Drusilla.
FIRST	I'm really not.
SPIKE	She was crazier 'n you.
FIRST	Dad-dy. No kicking. It's almost Christmas Day today and you've gone spoiling it. I've been so very good all year...
SPIKE	Dru... Love... Get bent.
FIRST	Stupid stubborn daddy.
BUFFY	"You've looked better," thank you, so much Mr. Principal sir...
JOYCE	Honey, what happened?
BUFFY	It's okay, Mom.
JOYCE	I tried to warn you, but... Right. The last thing you need now is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips. I'll get you some ice.
BUFFY	No. Mom, I can't.
JOYCE	Buffy, you have to heal.
BUFFY	I don't have time.
JOYCE	Are you worried about the sun going down? Because some things you can't control. The sun always goes down. The sun always comes up. Except in L.A., just of late.
BUFFY	Everyone's counting on me.
JOYCE	They do that. And I'm sorry, but these friends of yours put too much pressure on you. They always have.
BUFFY	Something Evil is coming.
JOYCE	Buffy, Evil isn't "coming." It's already here. Evil is always here. Don't you know? It's everywhere.
BUFFY	I have to stop it.
JOYCE	How are you going to do that?
BUFFY	I, I don't know. Yet, but...
JOYCE	Buffy. No matter what your friends expect of you, Evil is a part of us. All of us, it's natural And no one can stop that. No one can stop nature. Not even...
BUFFY	I'm sorry. What were we talking about?
ROGER	Only my life. You're just like all the others...
BUFFY	No. I'm different. I'm, I'm hip and relate to the young people. Don't go, uh, uh...
ROGER	"Roger?"
BUFFY	Roger. See, I knew that.
GILES	And the sun will go down in... (checks watch) ...seventeen minutes.
XANDER	Hey. Junior Slayers. Don't look so worried. I mean, sure, we may not know where Spike is, or how to fight the First, or if and when this Super- style vampire is gonna attack us all, however... House. Boarded up. All we gotta do now is trap this Ubervamp in the pantry - and it's game over.
WILLOW	Xander? Newbies. Let's ease them into the whole "jokes in the face of death" thing.
XANDER	Who's joking? That pantry thing could work. You saying M. Night Shamyalan lied to us?
BUFFY	You'll be okay.
WILLOW	Okay or even better. It's like our guarantee. Um, Buffy...?
BUFFY	No one expects you to make everything right.
WILLOW	Okay, I can't do everything, but I should be able to do something. I have so much power. But when I try to use it...
BUFFY	Don't, okay?
WILLOW	Okay.
BUFFY	I'll be okay. Okay or better. It's like my guarantee.
KENNEDY	Hey. Are we getting weapons? Trained fighters, badness coming. I've heard worse ideas.
ANNABELLE	We'll be armed when the Slayer feels we're ready.
MOLLY	I feel ready.
ANNABELLE	You're frightened. You must learn to control your fear.
KENNEDY	Hey. You know what would help with that? (to Buffy) Weapons.
BUFFY	I don't know.
KENNEDY	We're sitting ducks without them.
ANNABELLE	We're with the Slayer! Safe as houses.
KENNEDY	You see the house we're in?
ANNABELLE	It'll come straight for us, won't it?
BUFFY	Better load 'em up.
ANDREW	I've got a bad feeling about this.
XANDER	Of course you've got a "bad feeling." Dude. You're tied to a chair.
ANDREW	No. Well, yeah, but above and beyond that, I'm telling you my spider-sense is tingling. This is gonna get hairy. I'm talking weird with a beard. Better untie me.
BUFFY	And this will help us how?
ANDREW	Phht. Okay, I know what you're thinking. Andrew. Bad guy. You think I'm a super villain, like Dr. Doom, or Apokalypse, or, or... the Riddler.
BUFFY	And, when were you ever good before ?
ANDREW	Okay, technically, never. Touche .
BUFFY	How we doing on time?
GILES	Sunset should be any minute now. We've done all we can. Don't worry, everyone here understands it's you calling the shots.
BUFFY	Just hope I'm calling the right ones.
GILES	You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.
BUFFY	Oh, Giles. Not what I really needed to hear right...
MOLLY	Annabelle split.
XANDER	God almighty.
SPIKE	Never figured you for... ... existential thought, love. I mean, you hated Paris.
FIRST	You're alive for one reason, and one reason only. Because I wish it. Do you know why I wish it? Because I'm not done with you.
SPIKE	Give it up. Whatever you are - whatever you get away with - I'm out. You can't pull this puppet's strings anymore.
FIRST	And what makes you think you have a choice? What makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?
SPIKE	She does.
I	believe so. I won't lie to you, I don't know what to do in a situation like this, because there has never been a situation like this...
GILES	...which means we start back at square one.
XANDER	Which square would that be, exactly?
GILES	I'm not sure. The First pre-dates everything we've ever known, or can know. It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know it we can fight it.
BUFFY	We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll come. Can't run, can't hide... can't pretend it's not the end 'cause it is. Something has always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First.
GILES	Buffy, I know you're tired...
BUFFY	I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of Hell and it's going to swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me.
I	will kill it myself. There's only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil. And that's us.
ANYA	Nothing. And nothing. And the Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...
WILLOW	Yeah, my searches aren't turning anything up either. Are you sure this thing called itself The First?
BUFFY	Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before everything else-
ANYA	Please. How many times did I hear that line in my demon days. "I'm so rotten they don't even have a name for it... I'm baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?" Or terrified. Whatever.

BUFFY	Dawn-

DAWN	Anya gets to hit him.
WILLOW	Here's something!

JOYCE	You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.
BUFFY	Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.
JOYCE	I don't want to scare you. But I want you to take care. You need to wake up.
BUFFY	What?

If the Slayer line is eliminated, then the Hellmouth will have no guardian. The balance will be destroyed... It falls to you, Buffy. We'll do what we can - but only you have the strength to protect these girls - and the world - against what's coming.
XANDER	But no pressure.
KENNEDY	That's it? That's the plan?
GILES	Of course, we'll use all our resources, but-
KENNEDY	And if this thing is the root of all Evil, isn't the Hellmouth it's number one vacation spot? Don't you think we should be hiding our asses away on the other side of the globe?
ANNABELLE	Kennedy-
BUFFY	No, she's not wrong. We should have more muscle. That's why we have to find Spike.
ANYA	Yeah, he'll help. If he's not crazy. Or killing people. Or dead. Or, you know, all of tile above.
GILES	This place, where you last saw The First, you say it was in a Christmas tree lot?
BUFFY	Under it. There was a hidden cavern, happened to be under a tree lot. Those Bringer guys were doing some kind of ritual.
I	mean, a new kind of bad.
GILES	Just in time for Christmas.
GILES	If we survive this, I promise to.
BUFFY	Good. 'Cause I miss you.
GILES	I miss you too.
ANDREW	So, how long have you followed Buffy?
XANDER	I don't "follow" her. She's my best friend.
ANDREW	Huh. She seems like a good leader. Her hair is shiny. Does she make you stab things?
WILLOW	Annabelle can sleep here, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room-
KENNEDY	Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep. Molly'll talk her ear off.
WILLOW	Okay, then Molly down here, you with Dawn and Annabelle with me.
KENNEDY	Bad idea. Annabelle snores.
WILLOW	You want to do the sleeping arrangements?
DAWN	Does she wanna eat?
WILLOW	What? Huh? She's - she's new.
DAWN	Well Annabelle and Molly are starved and I totally burned the mac and cheese.
WILLOW	Or we can order a pizza.
ANNABELLE	As long as it's plain. I'm veggie-
MOLLY	Daft, you mean-
ANNABELLE	Just because you'll eat any kind of trash-
DAWN	Knock yourself out. I feel a cookie problem coming on myself.
GILES	So there was an entrance to the cave above ground here?
BUFFY	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
GILES	Good lord, are you alright?
BUFFY	Peachy. Except my knees bend backwards now. Stay up there, Giles. I'll check it out.
KENNEDY	Sorry about the British invasion.
MOLLY	We've been up for hours.
ANNABELLE	Four p.m. London time.
KENNEDY	You all right? You look...
GILES	Yes. But, Buffy, are you sure we shouldn't discuss this privately?
BUFFY	You mean not in front of the Next Generation?
ANNABELLE	Did you slay it?
BUFFY	No. It's still out there. Somewhere.
MOLLY	What does it want?
BUFFY	All of us dead.
GILES	Then until sunset, Buffy, you should rest. A few hours sleep will make a world of difference.
BUFFY	No sleep today. Can't.
GILES	But you're exhausted.
BUFFY	Comes with the gig. I don't think taking on pre-historic evil involves nap time.
GILES	Buffy - how exactly do you plan to research something as widespread as The First?
BUFFY	I have the best plan ever.
WOOD	"...In the Movies." (to Buffy) You're looking for evil movies?
BUFFY	I know it's not the all-time most Kosher use of office hours, but, uh, I'm facing a little downtime here and what can I say? I just love those evil, evil movies. Like "The Exorcist" or "Blair Witch".
WOOD	As opposed to, say, Rob Schneider's oeuvre.
BUFFY	Different evil.
WOOD	You okay? You've looked better.
BUFFY	Well, this isn't for the kids...
WOOD	Yeah, yeah... I'm only saying that once you see true Evil, it can have some serious afterburn. And then you can't unsee what you saw. Ever.
SPIKE	You're not Drusilla.
FIRST	I'm really not.
SPIKE	She was crazier 'n you.
FIRST	Dad-dy. No kicking. It's almost Christmas Day today and you've gone spoiling it. I've been so very good all year...
SPIKE	Dru... Love... Get bent.
FIRST	Stupid stubborn daddy.
JOYCE	Honey, what happened?
BUFFY	It's okay, Mom.
JOYCE	I tried to warn you, but... Right. The last thing you need now is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips. I'll get you some ice.
BUFFY	No. Mom, I can't.
JOYCE	Buffy, you have to heal.
BUFFY	I don't have time.
JOYCE	Are you worried about the sun going down? Because some things you can't control. The sun always goes down. The sun always comes up. Except in L.A., just of late.
BUFFY	Everyone's counting on me.
JOYCE	They do that. And I'm sorry, but these friends of yours put too much pressure on you. They always have.
BUFFY	Something Evil is coming.
JOYCE	Buffy, Evil isn't "coming." It's already here. Evil is always here. Don't you know? It's everywhere.
BUFFY	I have to stop it.
JOYCE	How are you going to do that?
BUFFY	I, I don't know. Yet, but...
JOYCE	Buffy. No matter what your friends expect of you, Evil is a part of us. All of us, it's natural And no one can stop that. No one can stop nature. Not even...
BUFFY	No. I'm different. I'm, I'm hip and relate to the young people. Don't go, uh, uh...
ROGER	"Roger?"
BUFFY	Roger. See, I knew that.
GILES	And the sun will go down in... (checks watch) ...seventeen minutes.
XANDER	Hey. Junior Slayers. Don't look so worried. I mean, sure, we may not know where Spike is, or how to fight the First, or if and when this Super- style vampire is gonna attack us all, however... House. Boarded up. All we gotta do now is trap this Ubervamp in the pantry - and it's game over.
WILLOW	Xander? Newbies. Let's ease them into the whole "jokes in the face of death" thing.
XANDER	Who's joking? That pantry thing could work. You saying M. Night Shamyalan lied to us?
BUFFY	You'll be okay.
WILLOW	Okay or even better. It's like our guarantee. Um, Buffy...?
BUFFY	No one expects you to make everything right.
WILLOW	Okay, I can't do everything, but I should be able to do something. I have so much power. But when I try to use it...
BUFFY	Don't, okay?
WILLOW	Okay.
KENNEDY	Hey. Are we getting weapons? Trained fighters, badness coming. I've heard worse ideas.
ANNABELLE	We'll be armed when the Slayer feels we're ready.
MOLLY	I feel ready.
ANNABELLE	You're frightened. You must learn to control your fear.
KENNEDY	Hey. You know what would help with that? (to Buffy) Weapons.
BUFFY	I don't know.
KENNEDY	We're sitting ducks without them.
ANNABELLE	We're with the Slayer! Safe as houses.
KENNEDY	You see the house we're in?
ANDREW	I've got a bad feeling about this.
XANDER	Of course you've got a "bad feeling." Dude. You're tied to a chair.
ANDREW	No. Well, yeah, but above and beyond that, I'm telling you my spider-sense is tingling. This is gonna get hairy. I'm talking weird with a beard. Better untie me.
BUFFY	And this will help us how?
ANDREW	Phht. Okay, I know what you're thinking. Andrew. Bad guy. You think I'm a super villain, like Dr. Doom, or Apokalypse, or, or... the Riddler.
BUFFY	And, when were you ever good before ?
ANDREW	Okay, technically, never. Touche .
BUFFY	How we doing on time?
GILES	Sunset should be any minute now. We've done all we can. Don't worry, everyone here understands it's you calling the shots.
BUFFY	Just hope I'm calling the right ones.
GILES	You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.
BUFFY	Oh, Giles. Not what I really needed to hear right...
SPIKE	Never figured you for... ... existential thought, love. I mean, you hated Paris.
FIRST	You're alive for one reason, and one reason only. Because I wish it. Do you know why I wish it? Because I'm not done with you.
SPIKE	Give it up. Whatever you are - whatever you get away with - I'm out. You can't pull this puppet's strings anymore.
FIRST	And what makes you think you have a choice? What makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?
SPIKE	She does.
I	believe so. I won't lie to you, I don't know what to do in a situation like this, because there has never been a situation like this...
GILES	...which means we start back at square one.
XANDER	Which square would that be, exactly?
GILES	I'm not sure. The First pre-dates everything we've ever known, or can know. It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know it we can fight it.
BUFFY	We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll come. Can't run, can't hide... can't pretend it's not the end 'cause it is. Something has always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First.
GILES	Buffy, I know you're tired...
BUFFY	I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of Hell and it's going to swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me.

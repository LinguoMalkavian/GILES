SPIKE	Okay. These two are dead. Why?
RONA	'Cause the black chick always gets it first?
VI	Ow. Ow.
BUFFY	What's that Rona?
RONA	I'm dead because... he's a vampire. I don't have Slayer strength, Slayer speed. It wasn't a fair fight.
SPIKE	Vi, do you really think I care if it's a fair fight?
VI	No. No sir. (searching for an answer) You don't play by the rules and I have learned a valuable lesson of some sort. Ow.
BUFFY	Okay Spike.
MOLLY	Not like you do.
BUFFY	No. Not yet. But it's there -- the potential . You have strength, speed, instinct. Learn to trust yourself. (to Rona) Rona, what did your instincts tell you to do just now?
RONA	Block his attack... Keep him off balance... gain the advantage...
BUFFY	No they didn't.
RONA	They told me to run.
BUFFY	Vi?
VI	They told me to run. They're still... sorta... telling me to run.
BUFFY	Don't fight on his terms. If your gut's telling you to run, run. Regain the higher ground. Make the fight your own.
SPIKE	Hunt. Kill.
BUFFY	Come at me. Full speed.
VI	That was like Top Gun!
BUFFY	Instinct. Understand his, but trust yours. (to the girls) You're chosen for a reason.
SPIKE	Fine. Couple'a ribs still ain't quite set right since... I'm fine.
BUFFY	Let me see.
SPIKE	No, it's --
BUFFY	Spike --
SPIKE	I'm okay, Buffy.
MOLLY	So we're supposed to like make out with him or something?
RONA	That's hot.
VI	Careful, Buffy. Just when you think it's part of the lesson he'll... hurt... your arm...
BUFFY	All right. Kennedy, Molly -- you're up. Let's go.
MOLLY	Knock it off!
BUFFY	You're all going to die.
RONA	Um... what does that mean? About The First?
BUFFY	Best we can tell? He, or, more precisely, it was putting a lot of stock in that uber-vamp thing, the Chaka Khan...
DAWN	Turok-Han.
BUFFY	...so when I kicked its ass, we figure the whole Firsty circus decided to back off. Good news is that means we probably don't have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while.
BUFFY	Xand, I know... No, I'm sorry, but... well, lock the door if you're gonna shower at my place. Of course they're curious.
AMANDA	Do people ever think you're weird?
BUFFY	Well, I guess, sure, in a charming, endearing, lovable... yes.
AMANDA	I feel like people think I'm weird. And so they pick on me. It's like an equation, I get it.
BUFFY	Just 'cause people think you're weird --
AMANDA	But I might be. Weird. I think. I think something might be...
BUFFY	Amanda. Why do you think you're weird?
AMANDA	One of the boys who picks on me. I kind of... see, if a boy picks on you, is it weird to think he's cute?
BUFFY	Oh.
AMANDA	I mean, I pick on him, too. We pick on each other. A lot. It's just the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to... you know. Pick on him... extra. More.
BUFFY	Ah... ha
AMANDA	The thing is, I can't tell... I mean, my mom says that when a boy teases you, it means he likes you.
BUFFY	Sometimes that's true.
AMANDA	My mom also says that sitting on cold surfaces gives you hemorrhoids. That's probably less true. Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other?
BUFFY	Well. Depends. Sometimes it's how people relate. Being mean to each other. Or mortal enemies, even. But, then with the... And, believe me, it leads to no good. Absolutely. No. Good. And much confusion. And then it's over. Really, definitely over. And that's confusing, too. The over part. Which it is. Over.
XANDER	I'm just saying, if you're going to go roughhousing all about, maybe there's a more appropriate place to do it than here, inside, like maybe outside. In another state. RONA We have to practice our hand-to-hand, it's what we do, maybe that thing should have been fastened a little better to the wall anyway, but no, that doesn't matter, just blame us --
VI	I still don't understand why Andrew had to stand over us yelling "Fight, little doggies, fight," because I think it only made it worse, and also it made me feel weird.
ANDREW	Why do we always have to yell ???
BUFFY	I was only gone a couple hours.
BUFFY	Look, everyone, it's Willow, perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.
WILLOW	Buffy. We just got news.
BUFFY	And she's sure?
WILLOW	Positive. Althenea says the seers definitely located another Potential Slayer here in Sunnydale. Someone who already lives here.
BUFFY	God.
ANYA	All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here? Right under our noses?
XANDER	Wait, the seers couldn't find her name? Or, like, her address or anything?
BUFFY	I was gonna take the girls out for a little show and tell tonight, maybe now I shouldn't.
ANDREW	Oh, they were so excited. You're going to break their little hearts.
BUFFY	This town is lousy with Bringers, I don't want to take the risk that they find her first.
WILLOW	No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just need to get together a few ingredients. You shouldn't skip your training, it's too important.
BUFFY	You think you can handle it?
XANDER	No problemo.
DAWN	Yeah, you guys have more important things to do.
BUFFY	Okay. Okay, I'll take them...
ANDREW	Yes!!
BUFFY	Andrew. You're not coming.
MOLLY	Crossbow! Gotta love it. Feels like I'm storming a castle.
RONA	You do a lot of that, do you?
MOLLY	I might, I owned a beauty like this. (practicing, posing) Halt!
DAWN	Okay, we're not pointing the weapons in the kitchen...
VI	It's not loaded.
DAWN	That's always the lead quote under the headline "household crossbow accident claims teen."
VI	Ooh, a mace!
DAWN	That's better.
RONA	Gotta go with the stake. Classic.
KENNEDY	Lost me there. Hey, we gearing up already?
DAWN	Oh. Right. Your little group patrol.
VI	More'n that. It's an outing.
KENNEDY	I'm thinkin' tonight? We might actually get to kill things.
DAWN	I've killed stuff sometimes...
ANDREW	I am not begging.
BUFFY	You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.
ANDREW	You don't want me to come along because you think I'm evil.
VI	He doesn't seem evil, exactly.
BUFFY	He's not evil, but when he gets close to it he picks up its flavor like a mushroom or something.
ANDREW	But I'm reformed! I'm like Vagita from Dragon Ball Z. I used to be a pure Sayan, but now I fight on the side of Goku.
BUFFY	You're not coming.
ANDREW	It's not fair. Spike just killed people and he gets to go.
BUFFY	Spike didn't have free will. You did.
ANDREW	Oh, I hate my free will.
SPIKE	This where you're all hidin'?
KENNEDY	Hey guys, we fit three more people in here and we can call the Guinness Book people.
SPIKE	We ready to go, or what?
BUFFY	Ready.
ANDREW	You wanna play Dragon Ball Z?
WILLOW	To light the aura of the new: Skin of snake and chrysalis too.
XANDER	Oh good god, what is that smell?
ANYA	I'm fairly sure that's the smell of throwing a hard-boiled egg into a fire.
XANDER	Uh-huh.
WILLOW	The smell will lead us to the Potential.
XANDER	Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.
WILLOW	She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura.
DAWN	Is it supposed to be shimmying all over like that?
WILLOW	Um... I'm not sure. I don't think so...
ANYA	Oh, sure, the fun, dance-y part is wrong, but the smell, that's just -- Look. Pretty.
WILLOW	I suck. I'm sorry, you guys. Maybe we can figure out something on the computer.
DAWN	Good call. I'll open the door and let this place air out.
XANDER	Don't worry Will. It's really no big.
WILLOW	I think it worked.
XANDER	Dawn!
WILLOW	Dawnie, are you okay?
DAWN	Did you do it wrong? Was it ambiguous in any way? Did you maybe ask about potential "sailors," 'cause I do love the water--
WILLOW	I did it right.
XANDER	Wow, she's... You're a Potential. You could be the next Slayer.
DAWN	Ooof.
ANYA	One second you're just a klutzy teenager with fake memories and a history of kleptomania and now suddenly you're a hero! A hero with a much abbreviated life span!
XANDER	This is huge. We have to think about this.
DAWN	I can't think about this. It doesn't fit in my head.
WILLOW	A Slayer. It makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about how they have the same blood or whatever?
ANYA	I never got that.
DAWN	She has to die. I mean, if I ever was the Slayer it would mean she died.
ANYA	Yes, it's like being the pope that way. Only you don't have be some old Catholic.
WILLOW	We need to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited.
XANDER	We can't She didn't take the cell with her.
DAWN	Well, sure. Because all the important people are with her.
XANDER	You're important now.
DAWN	What...
ANYA	Well, you could sit still for a second and a half maybe.
DAWN	No. I can't. I need to know what happens to my life.
WILLOW	Well, I guess Buffy trains you--
DAWN	Right. I train with the Potentials-- (catching herself) With the other Potentials. Learn to do all the stuff they're learning.
ANYA	We also need to protect you from the eyeless guys with the sharp, sharp knives.
DAWN	Bringers.
WILLOW	It's okay. We'll protect you.
DAWN	What if they saw the spell?
XANDER	Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flash cards. Big ones.
DAWN	We did a big orange powerful spell. What if they sensed it, what if they're on the way?
ANDREW	Are we gonna replace the microwave? 'Cuz I was thinking some Orville Redenbacher with the fresh butter flavor -- what's going on?
ANYA	Dawn's gonna be a Slayer.
ANDREW	Holy crap, excuse me. Plucked from ordinary life, handed a destiny...
XANDER	Say Skywalker and I smack you.
ANDREW	Does Buffy know?
XANDER	She left her phone.
ANDREW	Incommunicado.
WILLOW	We'll tell her the minute she gets home.
DAWN	Let's not.
WILLOW	What? Dawnie, she has to know.
DAWN	I know, just... not right away. Guys, listen... When Mom appeared to me... she said something...
WILLOW	Dawn--
DAWN	No. Please. She said something about Buffy and I'm thinking... I'm just not so sure that Buffy's gonna be happy for me.
WILLOW	Of course she will!
DAWN	Will she? I mean, I'm not sure I'm happy for me! Everything's different for me now!
ANYA	That's because you're part of something larger. Like getting swallowed. By something larger.
DAWN	This is... This is too big for my head again... I've gotta... I'll be...
XANDER	Nice work with the getting swallowed analogy.
ANYA	Well it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the Slayer, she'll have a short and brutal life. And if she doesn't, then her whole life smells of unfulfilled potential. The swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?
WILLOW	It's not like that. It's like... she's part of this huge power. I know what that feels like. It's wonderful.
ANDREW	Yes! I think Willow so captured it! It's like, well, it's almost like a metaphor for womanhood, isn't it? This sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve--
XANDER	I'll pay you to talk about Star Wars again.
ANYA	This is not about womanly power. This is about how Dawn just bought herself an early death.
WILLOW	We don't know that!
XANDER	Right. All we know is that everything just changed.
I	still think she needs to know.
WILLOW	...and we don't know what she meant about Buffy--
XANDER	I'm not talking about that! I mean, what do you think Buffy's gonna do with this information? Jump up and down and teach Dawn the secret handshake? She knows what this means!
ANYA	Short brutal life, sharp, sharp knives. I covered this.
XANDER	Right! You think Buffy wants that for Dawn?!
DAWN	I'm Chosen.
ANYA	He's right. We shouldn't rush her...
RONA	Hey, this is a bar!
KENNEDY	Best damn field trip I ever took.
MOLLY	Look. They're all...
VI	They're demons! It's a demon bar! Like a gay bar only with demons!
DEMON	Spike. Long time. Nice'a you to bring snacks.
SPIKE	Touch 'em and lose yer privates.
VI	I didn't like him.
RONA	We're a bunch of fifteen-year-olds in a demon bar. How much blending did you think we were gonna do?
BUFFY	That's okay. Usually, when you come to a place like this, it's 'cause you want to be seen You want to scare someone, or make contact--
MOLLY	Or maybe have a strong drink?
BUFFY	Not usually that.
KENNEDY	You don't drink?
BUFFY	Sure, I drink. I mean, no, that would be wrong.
BUFFY	Nope, go 'head. Down all the yak urine shots and pig's blood spritzers you want.
VI	Gross.
SPIKE	Got that right. Prices they charge, you should get human blood straight from the body.
BUFFY	Look, if I come here, it usually means I've gotta wring some information out of something large, scary, drunk and with a roomful of friends who don't care for the Slayer. Remember that. There's not a being in here who wouldn't gladly rip out your throat.
CLEM	Buffy! Hey girl, how you been?
BUFFY	Clem! Hey! You look great! Really toned!
KENNEDY	He's ripping out her throat right now.
CLEM	Omigod, it's so good to see you. I saw this special on the History Channel that I knew you'd love, but something went flooey with my Tivo--
BUFFY	Hey, let me talk to you for a second.
KENNEDY	You think she dated him too?
BUFFY	Clem, these are the girls. The Potentials.
CLEM	Howdy ! So, you girls're gonna deal with demons, huh? Well, lemme tell you this...
VI	I could stand a shot of that yak urine.
DAWN	Hey.
AMANDA	Hey, Dawn. Whatcha doing?
DAWN	Just walking. You?
AMANDA	Um, yeah. Just walking too.
I	guess I'll see you Monday morning?
DAWN	Yeah.
AMANDA	You alright?
DAWN	Sure! Yeah, just walking, you know.
AMANDA	I guess I... I had a bit of a, it's been a bizarre night.
DAWN	What happened? Who did that to you?
AMANDA	Nobody... exactly. I don't think you'd exactly believe me.
DAWN	Try me.
AMANDA	I was at school late because of; you know, Swing Choir, and I tore my vest, you know, the striped ones we wear, and I went by Home Sciences to sew it up...
DAWN	Uh-huh.
AMANDA	And by the time I was done, the place was empty. So it was all echoy and lonely and... Then this guy was there... or thing . And it was... It scratched at me and I kinda dodged it and it kinda hit its head?
DAWN	What kind of thing?
AMANDA	I don't know. It was messed up. In the face... ... around hereabouts.
DAWN	And when it scratched at you... did it... was it scratching with its teeth?
AMANDA	Is it real? Was it really a vampire?
DAWN	I...
AMANDA	Yeah? Well, cool.
I	don't know what to do.
DAWN	It's okay. This is deal-able. Don't worry.
AMANDA	I was thinking about getting your sister.
DAWN	My-- You know... you know something about my sister?
AMANDA	Well, I've heard people talking. A lot of 'em think she's some kind of high-functioning schizophrenic, but I also heard maybe, like maybe she could help with this kind of thing. Do you think we should go get her?
DAWN	She's out. I'll take this one.
DAWN	Maybe I should go out and try this some other way.
AMANDA	No, I gotcha.
DAWN	Whew! That was... I think I strained something. Maybe something I'll need later in life.
AMANDA	C'mon...
DAWN	Nah, I'm alright. I can do this. It's mostly instinct. I think.
AMANDA	So, if he scratched me with a tooth, am I... I'm not gonna turn into one, am I?
DAWN	Only if he slashed open one of his own veins and led you to drink deep of his blood.
AMANDA	Nope.
DAWN	Good. You're lucky he didn't hurt you way more'n that.
AMANDA	Right. He could do that. So I was thinking... We don't have to kill the vampire do we?
DAWN	What?
AMANDA	Just, suppose he got out and was maybe, like "encouraged" toward the gym? While the marching band was practicing -- because the way they look down on the swing choir -- it might be, you know, funny?
DAWN	Well, he didn't break the door down, anyway.
AMANDA	Yeah. Can they do that?
DAWN	They're very strong and although they feel pain, they don't hold back because of it.
AMANDA	I guess you're some kind of monster expert too.
DAWN	Let's just say it runs in the family.
AMANDA	It... it was... here.
DAWN	Amanda. It got out.
DAWN	I don't know. But we have to get out of here. It's just one vampire. All we have to do, is move fast, stay quiet, and remember: it could be anywhere.
AMANDA	What are you doing?
DAWN	I can never remember! It's gotta be rightside-up or upside down to work, which is it?
AMANDA	Do something!
BUFFY	Sometimes the animal hunts alone. Sometimes they run in packs. Who knows where we are?
RONA	A nest
BUFFY	Now can you tell?
KENNEDY	Only a vamp could live like this.
SPIKE	Some, yeah. I mean, as a group we're not known for our tasteful decor, but, in all fairness to the race? (kicking crate) This place is seriously lacking in style.
BUFFY	Thank you, Spike.
SPIKE	Merely saying.
BUFFY	He's got a point. The vampire can live anywhere, any way it wants. Tastes, fashions, living conditions - they can vary. But the animal inside? Always the same.
MOLLY	Where did you live?
SPIKE	What, you mean before? Well. Uh, a crypt, actually. But nicer. Bit more... dunno if "posh" is the right word, it was more like...
BUFFY	Comfy.
KENNEDY	Excuse me?
BUFFY	I mean, I'm guessing. I really wouldn't know. Moving on:
SPIKE	Work, work, work, you know this little excursion was just in danger of getting interesting.
BUFFY	Know something, Spike?
RONA	Buffy? I think we found something.
MOLLY	It's a body.
BUFFY	No. It's not a body.
DAWN	In here!
DAWN	Help me. We gotta barricade this.
AMANDA	Too big.
DAWN	Stay down.
AMANDA	Think we're safe?
BUFFY	No one's safe. Not here. Not ever. See this guy?
KENNEDY	B-but he was dead a minute ago.
BUFFY	That was a minute ago. Now?
GUY	Hey!
BUFFY	He's the enemy.
DAWN	Amanda.
AMANDA	Yes?
DAWN	Listen.
AMANDA	I'm listening.
DAWN	We're gonna get out of this. Both of us. Alive. You believe me?
AMANDA	I believe you.
DAWN	Good. I got a plan.
BUFFY	Reacting's better.
DAWN	I'm not guaranteeing it'll work.
AMANDA	Better than my idea about having him eat the marching band. Besides...
DAWN	In case you haven't noticed? I don't know what I'm doing.
AMANDA	You're getting it done.
BUFFY	The question is never "what do you think?" The question is always, "what do you know?" You gotta know. Because if you don't, you make one mistake...
BUFFY	You're dead. So what do you know? Right now, the only thing you know for sure is, you've got me.
WILLOW	C'mon sweetie, open up.
ANYA	Want me to kick down the door?
XANDER	Anya.
ANYA	What, it'd be funny, and besides, she's been sulking in there forev--
ANYA	Crap.
XANDER	Gone. We gotta find her. Before the Bringers do.
WILLOW	I can do a locator spell. But we gotta hurry.
DAWN	Amanda! Help me!
AMANDA	I-I... I can't.
DAWN	Amanda!
DAWN	Amanda!
AMANDA	What were those...?
DAWN	Amanda, listen to me. You know how you said I was special? Well, I'm not.
AMANDA	You're...
DAWN	But the thing is, you are.
AMANDA	No... no. I can't...
DAWN	You can. You've got to.
SPIKE	We phoned in. They told us to meet you here.
BUFFY	Fight now. Talk later.
AMANDA	Yeah. A little weird. Okay. One minute I'm in Swing Choir, and the next... What the hell's going on?
DAWN	She was at the doorway...
AMANDA	-- and I don't know if you're into "the drugs" but that's not my deal, all right? That cloud hit me and I got all... dizzy... and discombobulated...
DAWN	It was Willow's spell. She's the Potential Slayer.
RONA	...and I'm sure the vampire thought we were just four helpless girls. And then Vi actually yelled "We're just four helpless girls" --
VI	That was part of my plan.
RONA	But when it all started going down... (looks at the others) It was like we knew what we were doing. For real.
MOLLY	Like when you dodged that first attack and cracked him cross the jaw -- aces.
RONA	Oh no no -- that wouldn't have worked if you hadn't took his legs out --
VI	-- I hurt his arm. Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth --
MOLLY	When you staked him... seriously, the rush was like --
KENNEDY	So. You took one out solo.
MOLLY	Yeah, what was that like?
AMANDA	I don't know. I mean, when I saw that vampire -- vamp?
KENNEDY	Vampire's good too.
AMANDA	Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you know?
BUFFY	Hey.
DAWN	Yeah. I was thinking about hitting the books. Do some research on The First. It's in retreat mode right now - but you're still going to need to know how to fight it.
BUFFY	Great. Sounds good. Let's head downstairs guys. Get our newest arrival up to speed.
DAWN	What's up?
XANDER	Ah, I was just thinking about the girls. That's a harsh gig, being a Potential. Just picked out of a crowd, danger and destiny plus if you act now, death.
DAWN	They can handle it.
XANDER	Well, they're special. No doubt. And the amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know. Not even Buffy.
DAWN	Know what?
XANDER	How much harder it is for the rest of us.
XANDER	Seven years, Dawn. Working with the Slayer, watching my friends become more and more powerful... a witch, a demon, hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit but come the full moon he had wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful, all of them. And I'm the guy fixing the windows.
DAWN	You had that sexy army training for a little while, and, and the windows really do need --
XANDER	I saw what you did last night.
DAWN	I guess I sorta lost my head when I thought I was a Slayer.
XANDER	Thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale, 2003. And the minute you found out you weren't, you handed the crown over to Amanda without a moment's pause. You gave her your power.
DAWN	Power wasn't mine.
XANDER	They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie. To be the one who isn't chosen; to live so near the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes, 'cause nobody's watching me. I saw you last night, I see you working here today... You're not special. You're extraordinary.
DAWN	Maybe that's your power.
XANDER	What?
DAWN	Seeing. Knowing.
XANDER	Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape.
DAWN	Cape is good.
XANDER	Yeah.
RONA	'Cause the black chick always gets it first?
VI	Ow. Ow.
BUFFY	What's that Rona?
RONA	I'm dead because... he's a vampire. I don't have Slayer strength, Slayer speed. It wasn't a fair fight.
SPIKE	Vi, do you really think I care if it's a fair fight?
VI	No. No sir. (searching for an answer) You don't play by the rules and I have learned a valuable lesson of some sort. Ow.
BUFFY	Okay Spike.
MOLLY	Not like you do.
BUFFY	No. Not yet. But it's there -- the potential . You have strength, speed, instinct. Learn to trust yourself. (to Rona) Rona, what did your instincts tell you to do just now?
RONA	Block his attack... Keep him off balance... gain the advantage...
BUFFY	No they didn't.
RONA	They told me to run.
BUFFY	Vi?
VI	They told me to run. They're still... sorta... telling me to run.
BUFFY	Don't fight on his terms. If your gut's telling you to run, run. Regain the higher ground. Make the fight your own.
SPIKE	Hunt. Kill.
SPIKE	Fine. Couple'a ribs still ain't quite set right since... I'm fine.
BUFFY	Let me see.
SPIKE	No, it's --
BUFFY	Spike --
SPIKE	I'm okay, Buffy.
MOLLY	So we're supposed to like make out with him or something?
RONA	That's hot.
VI	Careful, Buffy. Just when you think it's part of the lesson he'll... hurt... your arm...
RONA	Um... what does that mean? About The First?
BUFFY	Best we can tell? He, or, more precisely, it was putting a lot of stock in that uber-vamp thing, the Chaka Khan...
DAWN	Turok-Han.
BUFFY	...so when I kicked its ass, we figure the whole Firsty circus decided to back off. Good news is that means we probably don't have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while.
AMANDA	Do people ever think you're weird?
BUFFY	Well, I guess, sure, in a charming, endearing, lovable... yes.
AMANDA	I feel like people think I'm weird. And so they pick on me. It's like an equation, I get it.
BUFFY	Just 'cause people think you're weird --
AMANDA	But I might be. Weird. I think. I think something might be...
BUFFY	Amanda. Why do you think you're weird?
AMANDA	One of the boys who picks on me. I kind of... see, if a boy picks on you, is it weird to think he's cute?
BUFFY	Oh.
AMANDA	I mean, I pick on him, too. We pick on each other. A lot. It's just the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to... you know. Pick on him... extra. More.
BUFFY	Ah... ha
AMANDA	The thing is, I can't tell... I mean, my mom says that when a boy teases you, it means he likes you.
BUFFY	Sometimes that's true.
AMANDA	My mom also says that sitting on cold surfaces gives you hemorrhoids. That's probably less true. Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other?
BUFFY	Well. Depends. Sometimes it's how people relate. Being mean to each other. Or mortal enemies, even. But, then with the... And, believe me, it leads to no good. Absolutely. No. Good. And much confusion. And then it's over. Really, definitely over. And that's confusing, too. The over part. Which it is. Over.
VI	I still don't understand why Andrew had to stand over us yelling "Fight, little doggies, fight," because I think it only made it worse, and also it made me feel weird.
ANDREW	Why do we always have to yell ???
BUFFY	Look, everyone, it's Willow, perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.
WILLOW	Buffy. We just got news.
BUFFY	And she's sure?
WILLOW	Positive. Althenea says the seers definitely located another Potential Slayer here in Sunnydale. Someone who already lives here.
BUFFY	God.
ANYA	All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here? Right under our noses?
XANDER	Wait, the seers couldn't find her name? Or, like, her address or anything?
BUFFY	I was gonna take the girls out for a little show and tell tonight, maybe now I shouldn't.
ANDREW	Oh, they were so excited. You're going to break their little hearts.
BUFFY	This town is lousy with Bringers, I don't want to take the risk that they find her first.
WILLOW	No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just need to get together a few ingredients. You shouldn't skip your training, it's too important.
BUFFY	You think you can handle it?
XANDER	No problemo.
ANDREW	Yes!!
BUFFY	Andrew. You're not coming.
MOLLY	Crossbow! Gotta love it. Feels like I'm storming a castle.
RONA	You do a lot of that, do you?
MOLLY	I might, I owned a beauty like this. (practicing, posing) Halt!
DAWN	Okay, we're not pointing the weapons in the kitchen...
VI	It's not loaded.
DAWN	That's always the lead quote under the headline "household crossbow accident claims teen."
VI	Ooh, a mace!
DAWN	That's better.
KENNEDY	Lost me there. Hey, we gearing up already?
DAWN	Oh. Right. Your little group patrol.
VI	More'n that. It's an outing.
KENNEDY	I'm thinkin' tonight? We might actually get to kill things.
DAWN	I've killed stuff sometimes...
ANDREW	I am not begging.
BUFFY	You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.
ANDREW	You don't want me to come along because you think I'm evil.
VI	He doesn't seem evil, exactly.
BUFFY	He's not evil, but when he gets close to it he picks up its flavor like a mushroom or something.
ANDREW	But I'm reformed! I'm like Vagita from Dragon Ball Z. I used to be a pure Sayan, but now I fight on the side of Goku.
BUFFY	You're not coming.
ANDREW	It's not fair. Spike just killed people and he gets to go.
BUFFY	Spike didn't have free will. You did.
ANDREW	Oh, I hate my free will.
SPIKE	This where you're all hidin'?
KENNEDY	Hey guys, we fit three more people in here and we can call the Guinness Book people.
SPIKE	We ready to go, or what?
BUFFY	Ready.
XANDER	Oh good god, what is that smell?
ANYA	I'm fairly sure that's the smell of throwing a hard-boiled egg into a fire.
XANDER	Uh-huh.
WILLOW	The smell will lead us to the Potential.
XANDER	Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.
WILLOW	She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura.
DAWN	Is it supposed to be shimmying all over like that?
WILLOW	Um... I'm not sure. I don't think so...
ANYA	Oh, sure, the fun, dance-y part is wrong, but the smell, that's just -- Look. Pretty.
WILLOW	I suck. I'm sorry, you guys. Maybe we can figure out something on the computer.
DAWN	Good call. I'll open the door and let this place air out.
XANDER	Dawn!
WILLOW	Dawnie, are you okay?
DAWN	Did you do it wrong? Was it ambiguous in any way? Did you maybe ask about potential "sailors," 'cause I do love the water--
WILLOW	I did it right.
XANDER	Wow, she's... You're a Potential. You could be the next Slayer.
DAWN	Ooof.
ANYA	One second you're just a klutzy teenager with fake memories and a history of kleptomania and now suddenly you're a hero! A hero with a much abbreviated life span!
DAWN	I can't think about this. It doesn't fit in my head.
WILLOW	A Slayer. It makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about how they have the same blood or whatever?
ANYA	I never got that.
DAWN	She has to die. I mean, if I ever was the Slayer it would mean she died.
ANYA	Yes, it's like being the pope that way. Only you don't have be some old Catholic.
WILLOW	We need to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited.
XANDER	We can't She didn't take the cell with her.
DAWN	Well, sure. Because all the important people are with her.
XANDER	You're important now.
ANYA	Well, you could sit still for a second and a half maybe.
DAWN	No. I can't. I need to know what happens to my life.
WILLOW	Well, I guess Buffy trains you--
DAWN	Right. I train with the Potentials-- (catching herself) With the other Potentials. Learn to do all the stuff they're learning.
ANYA	We also need to protect you from the eyeless guys with the sharp, sharp knives.
DAWN	Bringers.
WILLOW	It's okay. We'll protect you.
DAWN	What if they saw the spell?
XANDER	Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flash cards. Big ones.
DAWN	We did a big orange powerful spell. What if they sensed it, what if they're on the way?
ANDREW	Are we gonna replace the microwave? 'Cuz I was thinking some Orville Redenbacher with the fresh butter flavor -- what's going on?
ANYA	Dawn's gonna be a Slayer.
ANDREW	Holy crap, excuse me. Plucked from ordinary life, handed a destiny...
XANDER	Say Skywalker and I smack you.
ANDREW	Does Buffy know?
XANDER	She left her phone.
ANDREW	Incommunicado.
WILLOW	We'll tell her the minute she gets home.
DAWN	Let's not.
WILLOW	What? Dawnie, she has to know.
DAWN	I know, just... not right away. Guys, listen... When Mom appeared to me... she said something...
WILLOW	Dawn--
DAWN	No. Please. She said something about Buffy and I'm thinking... I'm just not so sure that Buffy's gonna be happy for me.
WILLOW	Of course she will!
DAWN	Will she? I mean, I'm not sure I'm happy for me! Everything's different for me now!
ANYA	That's because you're part of something larger. Like getting swallowed. By something larger.
XANDER	Nice work with the getting swallowed analogy.
ANYA	Well it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the Slayer, she'll have a short and brutal life. And if she doesn't, then her whole life smells of unfulfilled potential. The swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?
WILLOW	It's not like that. It's like... she's part of this huge power. I know what that feels like. It's wonderful.
ANDREW	Yes! I think Willow so captured it! It's like, well, it's almost like a metaphor for womanhood, isn't it? This sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve--
XANDER	I'll pay you to talk about Star Wars again.
ANYA	This is not about womanly power. This is about how Dawn just bought herself an early death.
WILLOW	We don't know that!
XANDER	Right. All we know is that everything just changed.
I	still think she needs to know.
WILLOW	...and we don't know what she meant about Buffy--
XANDER	I'm not talking about that! I mean, what do you think Buffy's gonna do with this information? Jump up and down and teach Dawn the secret handshake? She knows what this means!
ANYA	Short brutal life, sharp, sharp knives. I covered this.
XANDER	Right! You think Buffy wants that for Dawn?!
DAWN	I'm Chosen.
RONA	Hey, this is a bar!
KENNEDY	Best damn field trip I ever took.
MOLLY	Look. They're all...
VI	They're demons! It's a demon bar! Like a gay bar only with demons!
VI	I didn't like him.
RONA	We're a bunch of fifteen-year-olds in a demon bar. How much blending did you think we were gonna do?
BUFFY	That's okay. Usually, when you come to a place like this, it's 'cause you want to be seen You want to scare someone, or make contact--
MOLLY	Or maybe have a strong drink?
BUFFY	Not usually that.
KENNEDY	You don't drink?
BUFFY	Sure, I drink. I mean, no, that would be wrong.
BUFFY	Nope, go 'head. Down all the yak urine shots and pig's blood spritzers you want.
VI	Gross.
SPIKE	Got that right. Prices they charge, you should get human blood straight from the body.
BUFFY	Look, if I come here, it usually means I've gotta wring some information out of something large, scary, drunk and with a roomful of friends who don't care for the Slayer. Remember that. There's not a being in here who wouldn't gladly rip out your throat.
CLEM	Buffy! Hey girl, how you been?
BUFFY	Clem! Hey! You look great! Really toned!
CLEM	Omigod, it's so good to see you. I saw this special on the History Channel that I knew you'd love, but something went flooey with my Tivo--
BUFFY	Hey, let me talk to you for a second.
BUFFY	Clem, these are the girls. The Potentials.
CLEM	Howdy ! So, you girls're gonna deal with demons, huh? Well, lemme tell you this...
DAWN	Hey.
AMANDA	Hey, Dawn. Whatcha doing?
DAWN	Just walking. You?
AMANDA	Um, yeah. Just walking too.
AMANDA	You alright?
DAWN	Sure! Yeah, just walking, you know.
AMANDA	I guess I... I had a bit of a, it's been a bizarre night.
DAWN	What happened? Who did that to you?
DAWN	Try me.
AMANDA	I was at school late because of; you know, Swing Choir, and I tore my vest, you know, the striped ones we wear, and I went by Home Sciences to sew it up...
DAWN	Uh-huh.
AMANDA	And by the time I was done, the place was empty. So it was all echoy and lonely and... Then this guy was there... or thing . And it was... It scratched at me and I kinda dodged it and it kinda hit its head?
DAWN	What kind of thing?
AMANDA	I don't know. It was messed up. In the face... ... around hereabouts.
DAWN	And when it scratched at you... did it... was it scratching with its teeth?
DAWN	I...
AMANDA	Yeah? Well, cool.
DAWN	It's okay. This is deal-able. Don't worry.
AMANDA	I was thinking about getting your sister.
DAWN	My-- You know... you know something about my sister?
AMANDA	Well, I've heard people talking. A lot of 'em think she's some kind of high-functioning schizophrenic, but I also heard maybe, like maybe she could help with this kind of thing. Do you think we should go get her?
DAWN	Maybe I should go out and try this some other way.
AMANDA	No, I gotcha.
DAWN	Whew! That was... I think I strained something. Maybe something I'll need later in life.
AMANDA	C'mon...
AMANDA	So, if he scratched me with a tooth, am I... I'm not gonna turn into one, am I?
DAWN	Only if he slashed open one of his own veins and led you to drink deep of his blood.
AMANDA	Nope.
DAWN	Good. You're lucky he didn't hurt you way more'n that.
AMANDA	Right. He could do that. So I was thinking... We don't have to kill the vampire do we?
DAWN	What?
AMANDA	Just, suppose he got out and was maybe, like "encouraged" toward the gym? While the marching band was practicing -- because the way they look down on the swing choir -- it might be, you know, funny?
DAWN	Well, he didn't break the door down, anyway.
AMANDA	Yeah. Can they do that?
DAWN	They're very strong and although they feel pain, they don't hold back because of it.
DAWN	I don't know. But we have to get out of here. It's just one vampire. All we have to do, is move fast, stay quiet, and remember: it could be anywhere.
AMANDA	What are you doing?
DAWN	I can never remember! It's gotta be rightside-up or upside down to work, which is it?
AMANDA	Do something!
BUFFY	Sometimes the animal hunts alone. Sometimes they run in packs. Who knows where we are?
RONA	A nest
BUFFY	Now can you tell?
KENNEDY	Only a vamp could live like this.
SPIKE	Some, yeah. I mean, as a group we're not known for our tasteful decor, but, in all fairness to the race? (kicking crate) This place is seriously lacking in style.
BUFFY	Thank you, Spike.
SPIKE	Merely saying.
BUFFY	He's got a point. The vampire can live anywhere, any way it wants. Tastes, fashions, living conditions - they can vary. But the animal inside? Always the same.
MOLLY	Where did you live?
SPIKE	What, you mean before? Well. Uh, a crypt, actually. But nicer. Bit more... dunno if "posh" is the right word, it was more like...
BUFFY	Comfy.
KENNEDY	Excuse me?
BUFFY	I mean, I'm guessing. I really wouldn't know. Moving on:
SPIKE	Work, work, work, you know this little excursion was just in danger of getting interesting.
BUFFY	Know something, Spike?
RONA	Buffy? I think we found something.
MOLLY	It's a body.
BUFFY	No. It's not a body.
DAWN	In here!
DAWN	Help me. We gotta barricade this.
AMANDA	Too big.
DAWN	Stay down.
AMANDA	Think we're safe?
BUFFY	No one's safe. Not here. Not ever. See this guy?
KENNEDY	B-but he was dead a minute ago.
BUFFY	That was a minute ago. Now?
GUY	Hey!
BUFFY	He's the enemy.
DAWN	Amanda.
AMANDA	Yes?
DAWN	Listen.
AMANDA	I'm listening.
DAWN	We're gonna get out of this. Both of us. Alive. You believe me?
AMANDA	I believe you.
DAWN	Good. I got a plan.
BUFFY	Reacting's better.
DAWN	I'm not guaranteeing it'll work.
AMANDA	Better than my idea about having him eat the marching band. Besides...
DAWN	In case you haven't noticed? I don't know what I'm doing.
AMANDA	You're getting it done.
BUFFY	The question is never "what do you think?" The question is always, "what do you know?" You gotta know. Because if you don't, you make one mistake...
BUFFY	You're dead. So what do you know? Right now, the only thing you know for sure is, you've got me.
WILLOW	C'mon sweetie, open up.
ANYA	Want me to kick down the door?
XANDER	Anya.
ANYA	What, it'd be funny, and besides, she's been sulking in there forev--
ANYA	Crap.
XANDER	Gone. We gotta find her. Before the Bringers do.
WILLOW	I can do a locator spell. But we gotta hurry.
DAWN	Amanda! Help me!
AMANDA	I-I... I can't.
DAWN	Amanda!
AMANDA	What are you doing?
DAWN	I can never remember! It's gotta be rightside-up or upside down to work, which is it?
AMANDA	Do something!
BUFFY	Sometimes the animal hunts alone. Sometimes they run in packs. Who knows where we are?

DAWN	Amanda.
AMANDA	Yes?

AMANDA	I-I... I can't.
DAWN	Amanda!
AMANDA	You're...
DAWN	But the thing is, you are.
AMANDA	No... no. I can't...
DAWN	You can. You've got to.
SPIKE	We phoned in. They told us to meet you here.
BUFFY	Fight now. Talk later.
DAWN	She was at the doorway...
AMANDA	-- and I don't know if you're into "the drugs" but that's not my deal, all right? That cloud hit me and I got all... dizzy... and discombobulated...
RONA	...and I'm sure the vampire thought we were just four helpless girls. And then Vi actually yelled "We're just four helpless girls" --
VI	That was part of my plan.
RONA	But when it all started going down... (looks at the others) It was like we knew what we were doing. For real.
MOLLY	Like when you dodged that first attack and cracked him cross the jaw -- aces.
RONA	Oh no no -- that wouldn't have worked if you hadn't took his legs out --
VI	-- I hurt his arm. Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth --
MOLLY	When you staked him... seriously, the rush was like --
KENNEDY	So. You took one out solo.
MOLLY	Yeah, what was that like?
AMANDA	I don't know. I mean, when I saw that vampire -- vamp?
KENNEDY	Vampire's good too.
AMANDA	Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you know?
DAWN	Yeah. I was thinking about hitting the books. Do some research on The First. It's in retreat mode right now - but you're still going to need to know how to fight it.
BUFFY	Great. Sounds good. Let's head downstairs guys. Get our newest arrival up to speed.
DAWN	What's up?
XANDER	Ah, I was just thinking about the girls. That's a harsh gig, being a Potential. Just picked out of a crowd, danger and destiny plus if you act now, death.
DAWN	They can handle it.
XANDER	Well, they're special. No doubt. And the amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know. Not even Buffy.
DAWN	Know what?
XANDER	How much harder it is for the rest of us.
XANDER	Seven years, Dawn. Working with the Slayer, watching my friends become more and more powerful... a witch, a demon, hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit but come the full moon he had wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful, all of them. And I'm the guy fixing the windows.
DAWN	You had that sexy army training for a little while, and, and the windows really do need --
XANDER	I saw what you did last night.
XANDER	Thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale, 2003. And the minute you found out you weren't, you handed the crown over to Amanda without a moment's pause. You gave her your power.
DAWN	Power wasn't mine.
XANDER	They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie. To be the one who isn't chosen; to live so near the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes, 'cause nobody's watching me. I saw you last night, I see you working here today... You're not special. You're extraordinary.
DAWN	Maybe that's your power.
XANDER	What?
DAWN	Seeing. Knowing.
XANDER	Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape.
DAWN	Cape is good.
XANDER	Yeah.

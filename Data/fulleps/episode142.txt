FAITH	Okay, you guys, let's not freak out.
KENNEDY	I'm not. All I'm saying is that now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.
WOOD	Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about the losing of the necks --
ANYA	Let the woman speak the truth. We're all on death's doorstep, repeatedly ringing the bell, like maniacal Girl Scouts intent on making quota.
XANDER	I'm thinking maybe not everyone should have a say here --
GILES	What we need to do is figure out how to have constructive dialogue, without going completely mad --
AMANDA	Do you know Parliamentary Procedure? Because that's a convenient way of organizing verbal --
KENNEDY	I just wonder if those of us who've been here longer should have more of a say. What do you think, Faith? PRINCIPAL WOOD Maybe if we break down into smaller groups, this wouldn't be so chaotic.
AMANDA	When I was involved with Model UN, we found Parliamentary Procedure to be a total life saver. For example, once, when I was Uruguay --
GILES	She's going to be okay. It's -- it's all for the best.
DAWN	Yeah. But, then why do I feel like this?
GILES	Everything's going to be alright.
DAWN	I hope so.
FAITH	I hear what you're saying but --
KENNEDY	Shouldn't we get down to business and start talking about our game plan? We don't have all the time in the world here. Or maybe we do -- but that doesn't mean much anymore. WILLOW You guys? You guys? I think we're wasting our time arguing about how to argue.
AMANDA	Why don't we--
RONA	Girl, don't you mention Parliamentary Procedure.
DAWN	I second that.
FAITH	Everyone listen to me. Chill.
KENNEDY	Do we really have time to waste --
FAITH	Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed.
VI	Yeah... yeah. We'll get some rest and tomorrow, this won't seem so --
AMANDA	Vi, be quiet--
VI	what happened?
RONA	The lights went out? AMANDA I'll get some candles. If we have candles.
KENNEDY	I'll check the fuse box.
FAITH	Don't bother, all the lights on the whole street just went out.
RONA	Which means?
FAITH	That everyone from the Power Company has got the hell out of Sunnydale.
VI	I think I'm freaking out.
MAN	Get out of my house.
BUFFY	Hey.
MAN	You can't just kick me out of my own house.
BUFFY	Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays.
ANDREW	All right...I spy with my little eye something that begins with ... "T" --
SPIKE	Tapestry.
ANDREW	Hey... good one. How did you--
SPIKE	Tapestries the only things in the whole bloody room.
ANDREW	Ah. So say you... but I say, look deeper...
SPIKE	I'll look deep in your jugular, s'what I'll look deep at.
ANDREW	Don't spazz out.
SPIKE	I'm not -- don't you say another word.
ANDREW	Rock paper scissors?
SPIKE	What is wrong with you? Don't you understand what's happening here?
ANDREW	Uh, yeah. We're waiting 'til it's night again so you can ride on the motorcycle without exploding.
SPIKE	And ev'ry minute we're stuck here, the Slayer's back there, facing hell know's what...
ANDREW	You're worried about her. Come on, what's the worst thing that could happen to her? Wow, I'm imagining something really horrible. How 'bout you?
SPIKE	All right! I'll play if you want.
ANDREW	You will?
SPIKE	It's that or bash my head repeatedly against this wall.
ANDREW	Okay.. Let's see, let's see...
SPIKE	A "Y"? There's nothing here that--
ANDREW	' Yet another tapestry'!
SPIKE	Shoulda picked the bashing.
FAITH	So what do we know?
XANDER	We know we're basically the last humans left in Sunnydale.
CARIDAD	And that like, all the evil in town wants us dead.
VI	I don't want to die.
ANYA	Don't worry. It's far more likely that you'll stay alive long enough to watch most of your friends die first.
KENNEDY	We also know that Caleb told Buffy that everything's going down at the Seal. I think we should head --
FAITH	Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
KENNEDY	Faith, I'm sorry, don't you think that we should --
FAITH	I got this. So, let's go over our Rogue's Gallery, who exactly do we got here?
DAWN	There's The First. Who we can't touch.
XANDER	And our friend Mr. Reverend I-hate- women.
ANYA	Who's basically untouchable.
DAWN	And the 'Roid-rage Vamps, who are pretty much the worst, and the --
FAITH	Bringers... I think they're our weakest link.
GILES	Are you saying we should think about attacking the Bringers?
FAITH	Maybe, or -- okay, what if we kidnap one?
KENNEDY	And what, hold it ransom?
XANDER	I'll get the magazines and start ripping out letters now. "Dear The First, if you want your Bringer back -- well, we will be surprised because you have three million other ones...so please disregard this letter. Yours sincerely- -
FAITH	I'm saying, we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Get some info on The First and Caleb that way.
DAWN	I'm on board.
WOOD	How do you think we should capture one? If they don't want to be found--
KENNEDY	Okay, I'm not sure that this is such a good idea. Why try to get information when we already know about the Seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school, do some recon and then --
FAITH	No.
KENNEDY	Just like that. You're not even Listening!
WILLOW	Sweetie. You're pushing too hard.
KENNEDY	I thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.
FAITH	Things are different. Because, now? I'm your boss.
KENNEDY	Aye aye, captain.
FAITH	Okay, let's get down to business.
FIRST	I'd hoped you'd give me some better news.
CALEB	And I wish I had some.
FIRST	Is this going to do anything? Or is all of this just to make the Bringers sweat? Do the Bringers sweat?
CALEB	Actually, I think they pant, like dogs. (re: the Bringer's work) And, I don't know if this is doing any good. But we've got to try everything... what's a prophesy got on brute strength?
FIRST	You realize what will happen if the Slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
CALEB	They won't.
FIRST	That's right they won't.
CALEB	Hallelujah.
KENNEDY	I've never been the bait before. That was... Actually kind of scary.
CARIDAD	We had your back.
GILES	You did well. Your performance as a disgruntled minion was spot on.
KENNEDY	I'm method. Let's get this back to the Captain.
DAWN	Hey! So?
GILES	The Bringer's dumb.
ANYA	And you were expecting, what? A Rhodes Scholar?
GILES	Dumb as in mute. Dumb is a politically incorrect and outdated term that belies my youth in the Mesozoic Era.
WILLOW	Anyway --
FAITH	Someone ripped out its tongue.
AMANDA	Oh, gross...
XANDER	Hey, whoa there sweet-cakes, missing body parts can look pretty awesome. But this was totally gross.
DAWN	Hey.
WILLOW	Oh, yeah. I think I've read a translation of that.
DAWN	There's a translation? Oh, great! I'm reading like two words of Turkish a night when I could be... Okay, I'm over it. So the spell is for communicating with people who can't talk. Like when a person is dying and can't speak anymore, this spell would allow them to say their good-byes or y'know, gripe about how nobody ever came to visit. Do you think this'll help with Mr. No- tongue?
WILLOW	It should work... yeah, if we transmute the Bringer's internal synapses into sound waves... yep, I think so. I'll just need to get together some ingredients. It shouldn't take too long.
FAITH	Well, alright, cool. While Willow's doing that, why don't the rest of --
GILES	Spike.
SPIKE	Hey.
ANDREW	Hi, everybody. I missed you guys a lot. Sorry we took so long getting back from our mission-mission but we had to wait out the sun and hey -- Oh, cool... very Col. Nick Fury. You're lookin' good!
XANDER	Seeing slightly less good. But, thanks.
ANDREW	Well, I think we had a very successful trip. We rode on Spike's "hog", which was very cool and played some amusing games and, oh yeah, we've got some information -- but do you know what? I really need to urinate.
SPIKE	He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? Thank god I don't breathe.
DAWN	She's not here right now.
SPIKE	When's she get back?
WILLOW	While you were gone we all got together and talked out the disagreements we'd been having. And eventually, after some discussion, Buffy decided that it would be best for all of us if she took a little time off. A little breather.
SPIKE	I see. Uh-huh. Been practicing that lit'l speech long, have you? So Buffy took some time off, right in the middle of an apocalypse. And it was her decision?
XANDER	Well, we all decided.
SPIKE	Yeah, you all decided.
WILLOW	We're her friends; we only want --
SPIKE	That's ballsy of you. You're her friend and you betray her like this?
GILES	You don't understand --
SPIKE	You know, I think I do. Rupert. You used to be the big man, didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. And now she's surpassed you, and you can't handle it.
FAITH	Hey, why don't you take it down a notch or two? The time for giving speeches is over, Bat-boy.
SPIKE	Is that right?
FAITH	Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.
SPIKE	Alright.
FAITH	You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you?
SPIKE	Finally got what you always wanted, didn't you?
FAITH	I don't know.
ANDREW	Maybe you should let me rough him up a little.
XANDER	Andrew! KENNEDY Andrew, quiet!
WILLOW	I don't know, you guys; that should have worked.
GILES	Perhaps you should try again. Sometimes your conjugations are a little unusual --
ANDREW	I am a drone in the mind that is evil --
XANDER	Could you just shut up?
ANDREW	I say, I am a part of the Great Darkness --
KENNEDY	Somebody needs a reality check --
XANDER	And a muzzle --
GILES	Wait.
BRINGER	I am only a fragment of The We. We work as one to serve The First.
WILLOW	Okay, well, what are you, "The We", doing for The First?
BRINGER	We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.
KENNEDY	How? Tell me exactly what the Bringers are doing.
GILES	Kennedy, he can't see the knife.
BRINGER	We can feel the knife.
GILES	Kennedy?
BRINGER	We attend to the needs of infinite Evil. We exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of Slayer. We build an arsenal beneath the dirt. We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb. We protect --
XANDER	Wait, go back to that dirt thing.
BRINGER	We build weapons for the coming war.
ANYA	Can you do better specificity-wise than "under the dirt"?
BRINGER	At the farthest edge of town. We are everywhere. We are like the ocean's waves. We watch your efforts and are not scared. We will laugh at you as you die.
ANDREW	What the bananas!
GILES	We got something here. Let's get Faith in on this.
ANDREW	Ug! I feel used and violated and I need a lozenge.
SPIKE	Do you realize I could just walk in here, no invite needed? This town really is theirs now, isn't it?
SPIKE	No, this'll change your tune. I came here 'cause I got somethin' to tell you: You're right. You've been right since the beginning.
BUFFY	I don't feel very right. They blame me for stuff, and honestly? I can't say they're wrong.
SPIKE	You're not foolin' me.
BUFFY	What do you even mean?
SPIKE	You're not a quitter.
BUFFY	Oh... watch me.
SPIKE	Buffy, no. You were their leader and you still are. This isn't something that you gave up; it's something that they took.
BUFFY	And the difference is?
SPIKE	We can take it back.
FAITH	Sewer tunnel on the North side's closest, so guess we'll start there.
GILES	That sounds fine. What time should I tell everyone?
FAITH	How 'bout around seven? Seven sharp. So, tomorrow we fight.
GILES	Tomorrow. Good-night Faith. And Faith?
FAITH	Yeah?
GILES	You're doing just fine.
FIRST	I'd say better than 'fine'. I'd say you're doing a bang-up job.
FAITH	Get out.
FIRST	Well gosh - I think a "hello" or "nice to see you" might be a little more welcome. It's the end of humanity Faith, not the end of courtesy.
FAITH	You're wasting your time. I know who you are. What you are.
FIRST	Nobody's explained to you how this works, have they?
FIRST	I know! Most people guess Beth. But Meg was such a proper young lady. Remember when Jo burned her hair?
FAITH	I know what you're doing. It's not gonna work. But feel free to keep talking. Hell, I could listen to you yap all night.
FIRST	Hey hey hey -- language . You're a leader now. You keep throwing the "H- E-double hockey sticks" around, pretty soon these girls are going to pick up on it. Then what?
FAITH	You let me worry about the girls.
FIRST	Of course, of course... You're doing a great job with them, by the way. Much better than Buffy ever did. You were smart to kick her out.
FAITH	That's not what we... Buffy got 'em this far.
FIRST	Why are you protecting her? You think she cares about you?
FAITH	It's different now.
FIRST	No matter what you do, Buffy will always see you as a killer, not as a person. And now you have what she so desperately wants -- the respect of these girls. All she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. Stay on guard, Faith. Buffy's dangerous. If you're not careful, she'll destroy you. I'm just sayin'.
SPIKE	"No"?
BUFFY	No.
SPIKE	You mean no as in, eventually?
BUFFY	You really have trouble with that word, don't you?
SPIKE	I don't understand. I don't understand you one bit.
BUFFY	I've actually been aware of that for some time.
SPIKE	You can get them back.
BUFFY	Can, maybe. Should? I don't know I'm so tired...
SPIKE	They need you!
BUFFY	Well, I --
SPIKE	It's bloody chaos over there without you!
BUFFY	It is?
SPIKE	Yeah yeah, it's, uh --
BUFFY	How do you mean?
SPIKE	There's... junk, food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up... everyone's very scared and uh, unkempt...
BUFFY	Sounds dire.
SPIKE	Look, I didn't see a lot. I came, hit Faith a bunch of times and left.
BUFFY	Really? I mean, I'm not glad of that...
SPIKE	Say the word and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like a painful accident...
BUFFY	That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies. Every time.
SPIKE	There's always casualties in a war.
BUFFY	Casualties... it sounds so casual. These are girls. That I got killed.
SPIKE	Okay, first mistake --
BUFFY	And I can't fault them for kicking me out. I've been... I've just cut myself off from them, all of them. 'Cause I knew I was gonna lose some of them, and I didn't want to...
I	stayed that way. People try to connect to me but I just... I slip away.
SPIKE	I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.
BUFFY	Please, Spike. We never got close. That's why you wanted me -- 'cause I was unattainable.
SPIKE	You think that's all it was?
BUFFY	I don't want to go over the --
SPIKE	No. Hold on here, I've hummed along to your pity ditty, I think I should have the mic for a bit.
BUFFY	Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.
SPIKE	You're insufferable.
BUFFY	Thank you. That helped.
SPIKE	I'm not trying to cheer you up!
BUFFY	Well what are you trying to say?
SPIKE	I don't know! I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off and I just... Unattainable! That's it!
BUFFY	Okay, I'm attainable. I'm an attainathon. Can I sleep now?
SPIKE	You listen to me. I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I'd prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker; I follow my blood, which does not always rush in the direction of my head. So I've made a lot of mistakes. A lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred plus years, only one thing I've ever been sure of. You.
I	love you, it's not because I want you, or 'cause I can't have you -- it has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try... I've seen your strength, and your kindness, I've seen the best and the worst of you and I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You are a hell of a woman.
BUFFY	I don't... I don't want to be the one.
SPIKE	I don't want to be this good-looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear.
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Sure.
BUFFY	No. I mean... here. Would you just... hold me?
FIRST	Deep down, you've always wanted Buffy to accept you -- to love you, even. Why do you think that is?
FAITH	You a shrink now?
FIRST	You keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these "friends" of yours. But you're never going to find it. The truth is, nobody will ever love you. Not the way I love you.
FAITH	Get out.
FIRST	They'll forever see you as a killer.
FAITH	I said get out.
FIRST	I'll always be with you, firecracker. In everything you do.
FAITH	Shouldn't sneak up like that. Almost took your head off.
WOOD	Sorry. I knocked -
FAITH	What'd you see?
WOOD	Just you looking spooked. What happened?
FAITH	Nothing. Forget it. What's up?
WOOD	I was just going to fill you in on our weapons status.
FAITH	So - fill. Go.
WOOD	We need more. You sure you're alright?
FAITH	What? You want to rap about my problems? You hopin' to be the guy who puts the pal in principal for me?
WOOD	Okay... I came up to talk weapons; I see you, you... look kinda upset, and I ask if you're okay. Where exactly did I go wrong?
FAITH	Sorry; I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just --
WOOD	I'll leave you alone. Didn't mean to intrude.
FAITH	It was The First.
WOOD	You're really in the game now. First doesn't show unless it thinks you matter.
FAITH	Lucky me. I'm a player.
WOOD	But that's what The First does. Find your achilles heel.
FAITH	Naw. It just talked to me. It does a heel thing too?
WOOD	It's a phrase. Your weak spot.
FAITH	Ah. The school thing. I was kinda absent that decade.
WOOD	So, who was it -- The First?
FAITH	He was... like, an old boss of mine.
WOOD	Just a boss? And seein' him make's you shake like that? Wouldn't give you a raise, huh?
FAITH	Yeah, right? Nah. I know it sounds retarded, but he was like a dad to me.
WOOD	Oh. It was my mother. When it came to me. And, I mean, it was her. Right down to the perfume: patchouli and lilac.
FAITH	Sorry.
WOOD	Yeah.
FAITH	I'm just pissed at myself. I knew it was a trick...
WOOD	So did I. And I still wanted my mama to hold me like a little baby. In a manly way. Of course.
FAITH	Of course.
WOOD	Nobody wants to be alone, Faith. We all want someone who cares. To be touched that way. The First may deal in figments - but the wanting is real.
FAITH	Hitting things and a whole lotta Jack D dulls it some.
WOOD	Among other things.
FAITH	When it came to you, did The First tell you the truth?
WOOD	Yes.
FAITH	It said that we've got to watch out for Buffy. That Buffy's dangerous.
WOOD	What do you think?
FAITH	Could be. We've given B a mighty reason to be pissed off. The messed-up thing? The First is telling me to worry about her - and I just wish she was here. In a couple of hours, I'm leading these girls into some serious crap. And she's the only one...
WOOD	She's not the only one. You're a slayer too. And I think you're a leader.
FAITH	I'm an ex-con that didn't finish high school.
WOOD	I'm the principal of a school that nobody finished. And I'm totally out my league in this.
FAITH	I hear otherwise.
WOOD	So, tomorrow --
FAITH	Forget about tomorrow. This is tonight.
WOOD	Hey. You're the leader.
FAITH	Touch me.
WILLOW	Okay guys, Giles said that Faith said that we should be ready to go early in the --
KENNEDY	Looks like there's only one girl here.
WILLOW	But what about the other ones, with their sleeping bags and their head- gear and their snoring and... (smiling big) They're not here, are they?
KENNEDY	Nope.
WILLOW	That's nice.
KENNEDY	Nice and necessary. Our foreplay was threatening to turn into twelve-play.
WILLOW	No, no I just... I guess I'm kinda scared.
KENNEDY	It's probably to stupid to ask why, huh? Death, war, apocalypse --
WILLOW	Me.
KENNEDY	And then, isn't that the good part?
WILLOW	Yeah, good. Good feeling. But also...
KENNEDY	Bad stuff like unrestrained moaning and screaming with joy?
WILLOW	Well, yeah. Sort of. Yeah, with the unrestrained of it. I've been in a place where I kinda should be restrained. I've been controlling myself and if I get out of control... if I let myself go, I could just... go.
KENNEDY	You're worried you're going to turn into Big Bad Willow.
WILLOW	It's not stupid. When we kissed, I turned into a... Warren.
KENNEDY	It's not stupid. But it's not going to happen. C'mon...
WILLOW	I don't know...
KENNEDY	I guess, I -- I just want you to know that you're safe with me.
WILLOW	Yeah?
KENNEDY	I'll keep you safe. You can float around and I'll tether you down.
WILLOW	You'll be, like, my kite string?
KENNEDY	You be a kite and I'll be your kite string. Okay?
WILLOW	Okay.
ANYA	They could have a little respect, you know.
XANDER	Mmmmmm.
ANYA	I mean, they should at least acknowledge the possibility that some people might not want to listen to an a cappella concert of moaning and groaning.
XANDER	Mmmmmm.
ANYA	It's disgusting is what it is.
XANDER	Little jealous, huh?
ANYA	Well, of course! A lot jealous. If you and I are done having sex, I think everyone else should just knock it off.
FIRST	Isn't that the strangest thing?
CALEB	Well, it does throw me a tad... they're just, well they're barely more than animals, feeding off each others flesh. It's nauseating. But you, you're everywhere. You're in the hearts of little children, in the souls of the rich, you're the fire that makes people kill and hate, the cleansing fire that will cure the world of weakness. They're just sinners. You are Sin.
FIRST	I do like your sermons.
CALEB	And you're in me. Gave me strength no man can have.
FIRST	You're the only man strong enough to be my vessel. And I know you feel me, but I... I know why they grab at each other. To feel. I want to feel. I want to put my hands around an innocent neck and feel it crack. I want to bite off a young girl's face and feel the skin and gristle slither down my throat.
CALEB	Now that is truly poetical.
FIRST	We have to kill them.
CALEB	We are.
FIRST	We have to do it faster.
CALEB	Amen.
ANDREW	So it turned out that all these stone tablets basically said the same thing. The First and Caleb are trying to protect something. We don't know exactly what, but it's something powerful and they don't want the Slayers to get it. I'm thinking it could be a weapon and if we are looking for an arsena --
FAITH	You're not coming.
ANDREW	If one is looking for an arsenal, Well, what better place to find a --
FAITH	Weapon. Okay, got it. Good. Good thinking, Andrew.
ANDREW	It's a pleasure, Faith. Back to you.
FAITH	Enough. Okay, I need you four to suss out the low-down on B.
WOOD	Where do you want me, Faith?
FAITH	By your phone. I'll call you when I need you.
DAWN	What are we looking for, I mean, is there some reason we should... spy on Buffy?
FAITH	We're just making sure she's okay.
CALEB	It shouldn't be long now. Prophesies say one thing but brute strength says another. We'll get it out.
FIRST	I heard you Caleb.
CALEB	We're almost there.
FIRST	Yes. That's true. Now rouse the Bringers, get them back to work --
BUFFY	I hear you've got something of mine.
CALEB	Well, if it ain't the prodigal Slayer...
BUFFY	So where's it at? I'm gonna find it sooner or later.
CALEB	No you're not. I lay a hand on you and you're just a dead little girl.
BUFFY	So lay a hand on me. If you can.
FIRST	Caleb, this is getting embarrassing.
CALEB	Do you have to look like that?
FIRST	Will you concentrate?
CALEB	It's just a little confusing.
FIRST	Fine. Go. Kill.
AMANDA	Do you think there's rats down here? This one summer my cousin and I dissected this dead rat we found in the basement. It was so creepy, oh boy --
KENNEDY	Amanda.
FAITH	Everybody stop.
KENNEDY	Look at all this.
RONA	I don't get it. Why'd they abandon all this stuff?
FAITH	Maybe 'cause they didn't.
AMANDA	AAAAAAaaaaaaa!
CALEB	You whore.
BUFFY	Y'know, you should really watch your language. Someone who didn't know you might think you were a woman- hating prick.
RONA	Is that it? I mean, not that that wasn't fun but... eight Bringers?
VI	There's not much here actually. Not really a full arsenal, more of just an --
AMANDA	Arse? Heh, heh. Good one.
KENNEDY	Yo, Faith. Check this out.
FAITH	Okay, you guys, let's not freak out.
KENNEDY	I'm not. All I'm saying is that now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.
WOOD	Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about the losing of the necks --
ANYA	Let the woman speak the truth. We're all on death's doorstep, repeatedly ringing the bell, like maniacal Girl Scouts intent on making quota.
XANDER	I'm thinking maybe not everyone should have a say here --
GILES	What we need to do is figure out how to have constructive dialogue, without going completely mad --
AMANDA	Do you know Parliamentary Procedure? Because that's a convenient way of organizing verbal --
GILES	She's going to be okay. It's -- it's all for the best.
DAWN	Yeah. But, then why do I feel like this?
GILES	Everything's going to be alright.
DAWN	I hope so.
AMANDA	Why don't we--
RONA	Girl, don't you mention Parliamentary Procedure.
DAWN	I second that.
FAITH	Everyone listen to me. Chill.
KENNEDY	Do we really have time to waste --
FAITH	Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed.
AMANDA	Vi, be quiet--
VI	what happened?
KENNEDY	I'll check the fuse box.
FAITH	Don't bother, all the lights on the whole street just went out.
RONA	Which means?
FAITH	That everyone from the Power Company has got the hell out of Sunnydale.
MAN	You can't just kick me out of my own house.
BUFFY	Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays.
ANDREW	All right...I spy with my little eye something that begins with ... "T" --
SPIKE	Tapestry.
ANDREW	Hey... good one. How did you--
SPIKE	Tapestries the only things in the whole bloody room.
ANDREW	Ah. So say you... but I say, look deeper...
SPIKE	I'll look deep in your jugular, s'what I'll look deep at.
ANDREW	Don't spazz out.
SPIKE	I'm not -- don't you say another word.
SPIKE	What is wrong with you? Don't you understand what's happening here?
ANDREW	Uh, yeah. We're waiting 'til it's night again so you can ride on the motorcycle without exploding.
SPIKE	And ev'ry minute we're stuck here, the Slayer's back there, facing hell know's what...
ANDREW	You're worried about her. Come on, what's the worst thing that could happen to her? Wow, I'm imagining something really horrible. How 'bout you?
SPIKE	All right! I'll play if you want.
ANDREW	You will?
SPIKE	It's that or bash my head repeatedly against this wall.
ANDREW	Okay.. Let's see, let's see...
SPIKE	A "Y"? There's nothing here that--
ANDREW	' Yet another tapestry'!
SPIKE	Shoulda picked the bashing.
FAITH	So what do we know?
XANDER	We know we're basically the last humans left in Sunnydale.
CARIDAD	And that like, all the evil in town wants us dead.
VI	I don't want to die.
ANYA	Don't worry. It's far more likely that you'll stay alive long enough to watch most of your friends die first.
KENNEDY	We also know that Caleb told Buffy that everything's going down at the Seal. I think we should head --
FAITH	Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
KENNEDY	Faith, I'm sorry, don't you think that we should --
FAITH	I got this. So, let's go over our Rogue's Gallery, who exactly do we got here?
DAWN	There's The First. Who we can't touch.
XANDER	And our friend Mr. Reverend I-hate- women.
ANYA	Who's basically untouchable.
DAWN	And the 'Roid-rage Vamps, who are pretty much the worst, and the --
FAITH	Bringers... I think they're our weakest link.
GILES	Are you saying we should think about attacking the Bringers?
FAITH	Maybe, or -- okay, what if we kidnap one?
KENNEDY	And what, hold it ransom?
XANDER	I'll get the magazines and start ripping out letters now. "Dear The First, if you want your Bringer back -- well, we will be surprised because you have three million other ones...so please disregard this letter. Yours sincerely- -
FAITH	I'm saying, we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Get some info on The First and Caleb that way.
DAWN	I'm on board.
WOOD	How do you think we should capture one? If they don't want to be found--
KENNEDY	Okay, I'm not sure that this is such a good idea. Why try to get information when we already know about the Seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school, do some recon and then --
FAITH	No.
KENNEDY	Just like that. You're not even Listening!
WILLOW	Sweetie. You're pushing too hard.
KENNEDY	I thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.
FAITH	Things are different. Because, now? I'm your boss.
KENNEDY	Aye aye, captain.
FAITH	Okay, let's get down to business.
FIRST	I'd hoped you'd give me some better news.
CALEB	And I wish I had some.
FIRST	Is this going to do anything? Or is all of this just to make the Bringers sweat? Do the Bringers sweat?
CALEB	Actually, I think they pant, like dogs. (re: the Bringer's work) And, I don't know if this is doing any good. But we've got to try everything... what's a prophesy got on brute strength?
FIRST	You realize what will happen if the Slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
CALEB	They won't.
FIRST	That's right they won't.
KENNEDY	I've never been the bait before. That was... Actually kind of scary.
CARIDAD	We had your back.
DAWN	Hey! So?
GILES	The Bringer's dumb.
ANYA	And you were expecting, what? A Rhodes Scholar?
GILES	Dumb as in mute. Dumb is a politically incorrect and outdated term that belies my youth in the Mesozoic Era.
WILLOW	Anyway --
FAITH	Someone ripped out its tongue.
AMANDA	Oh, gross...
XANDER	Hey, whoa there sweet-cakes, missing body parts can look pretty awesome. But this was totally gross.
DAWN	Hey.
WILLOW	Oh, yeah. I think I've read a translation of that.
DAWN	There's a translation? Oh, great! I'm reading like two words of Turkish a night when I could be... Okay, I'm over it. So the spell is for communicating with people who can't talk. Like when a person is dying and can't speak anymore, this spell would allow them to say their good-byes or y'know, gripe about how nobody ever came to visit. Do you think this'll help with Mr. No- tongue?
WILLOW	It should work... yeah, if we transmute the Bringer's internal synapses into sound waves... yep, I think so. I'll just need to get together some ingredients. It shouldn't take too long.
FAITH	Well, alright, cool. While Willow's doing that, why don't the rest of --
ANDREW	Hi, everybody. I missed you guys a lot. Sorry we took so long getting back from our mission-mission but we had to wait out the sun and hey -- Oh, cool... very Col. Nick Fury. You're lookin' good!
XANDER	Seeing slightly less good. But, thanks.
ANDREW	Well, I think we had a very successful trip. We rode on Spike's "hog", which was very cool and played some amusing games and, oh yeah, we've got some information -- but do you know what? I really need to urinate.
DAWN	She's not here right now.
SPIKE	When's she get back?
WILLOW	While you were gone we all got together and talked out the disagreements we'd been having. And eventually, after some discussion, Buffy decided that it would be best for all of us if she took a little time off. A little breather.
SPIKE	I see. Uh-huh. Been practicing that lit'l speech long, have you? So Buffy took some time off, right in the middle of an apocalypse. And it was her decision?
XANDER	Well, we all decided.
SPIKE	Yeah, you all decided.
WILLOW	We're her friends; we only want --
SPIKE	That's ballsy of you. You're her friend and you betray her like this?
GILES	You don't understand --
SPIKE	You know, I think I do. Rupert. You used to be the big man, didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. And now she's surpassed you, and you can't handle it.
SPIKE	Is that right?
FAITH	Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.
SPIKE	Alright.
FAITH	I don't know.
WILLOW	I don't know, you guys; that should have worked.
GILES	Perhaps you should try again. Sometimes your conjugations are a little unusual --
ANDREW	I am a drone in the mind that is evil --
XANDER	Could you just shut up?
ANDREW	I say, I am a part of the Great Darkness --
KENNEDY	Somebody needs a reality check --
XANDER	And a muzzle --
GILES	Wait.
WILLOW	Okay, well, what are you, "The We", doing for The First?
BRINGER	We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.
KENNEDY	How? Tell me exactly what the Bringers are doing.
GILES	Kennedy, he can't see the knife.
BRINGER	We can feel the knife.
BRINGER	We attend to the needs of infinite Evil. We exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of Slayer. We build an arsenal beneath the dirt. We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb. We protect --
XANDER	Wait, go back to that dirt thing.
BRINGER	We build weapons for the coming war.
ANYA	Can you do better specificity-wise than "under the dirt"?
BRINGER	At the farthest edge of town. We are everywhere. We are like the ocean's waves. We watch your efforts and are not scared. We will laugh at you as you die.
GILES	We got something here. Let's get Faith in on this.
ANDREW	Ug! I feel used and violated and I need a lozenge.
SPIKE	You're not foolin' me.
BUFFY	What do you even mean?
SPIKE	You're not a quitter.
BUFFY	Oh... watch me.
SPIKE	Buffy, no. You were their leader and you still are. This isn't something that you gave up; it's something that they took.
BUFFY	And the difference is?
SPIKE	We can take it back.
FAITH	Sewer tunnel on the North side's closest, so guess we'll start there.
GILES	That sounds fine. What time should I tell everyone?
FAITH	How 'bout around seven? Seven sharp. So, tomorrow we fight.
GILES	Tomorrow. Good-night Faith. And Faith?
FAITH	Yeah?
GILES	You're doing just fine.
FAITH	Get out.
FIRST	Well gosh - I think a "hello" or "nice to see you" might be a little more welcome. It's the end of humanity Faith, not the end of courtesy.
FAITH	You're wasting your time. I know who you are. What you are.
FIRST	Nobody's explained to you how this works, have they?
FIRST	I know! Most people guess Beth. But Meg was such a proper young lady. Remember when Jo burned her hair?
FAITH	I know what you're doing. It's not gonna work. But feel free to keep talking. Hell, I could listen to you yap all night.
FIRST	Hey hey hey -- language . You're a leader now. You keep throwing the "H- E-double hockey sticks" around, pretty soon these girls are going to pick up on it. Then what?
FAITH	You let me worry about the girls.
FIRST	Of course, of course... You're doing a great job with them, by the way. Much better than Buffy ever did. You were smart to kick her out.
FAITH	That's not what we... Buffy got 'em this far.
FIRST	Why are you protecting her? You think she cares about you?
FAITH	It's different now.
FIRST	No matter what you do, Buffy will always see you as a killer, not as a person. And now you have what she so desperately wants -- the respect of these girls. All she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. Stay on guard, Faith. Buffy's dangerous. If you're not careful, she'll destroy you. I'm just sayin'.
SPIKE	"No"?
BUFFY	No.
SPIKE	You mean no as in, eventually?
BUFFY	You really have trouble with that word, don't you?
SPIKE	I don't understand. I don't understand you one bit.
BUFFY	I've actually been aware of that for some time.
SPIKE	You can get them back.
BUFFY	Can, maybe. Should? I don't know I'm so tired...
SPIKE	They need you!
BUFFY	Well, I --
SPIKE	It's bloody chaos over there without you!
BUFFY	It is?
SPIKE	Yeah yeah, it's, uh --
BUFFY	How do you mean?
SPIKE	There's... junk, food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up... everyone's very scared and uh, unkempt...
BUFFY	Sounds dire.
SPIKE	Look, I didn't see a lot. I came, hit Faith a bunch of times and left.
BUFFY	Really? I mean, I'm not glad of that...
SPIKE	Say the word and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like a painful accident...
BUFFY	That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies. Every time.
SPIKE	There's always casualties in a war.
BUFFY	Casualties... it sounds so casual. These are girls. That I got killed.
SPIKE	Okay, first mistake --
BUFFY	And I can't fault them for kicking me out. I've been... I've just cut myself off from them, all of them. 'Cause I knew I was gonna lose some of them, and I didn't want to...
SPIKE	I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.
BUFFY	Please, Spike. We never got close. That's why you wanted me -- 'cause I was unattainable.
SPIKE	You think that's all it was?
BUFFY	I don't want to go over the --
SPIKE	No. Hold on here, I've hummed along to your pity ditty, I think I should have the mic for a bit.
BUFFY	Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.
SPIKE	You're insufferable.
BUFFY	Thank you. That helped.
SPIKE	I'm not trying to cheer you up!
BUFFY	Well what are you trying to say?
SPIKE	I don't know! I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off and I just... Unattainable! That's it!
BUFFY	Okay, I'm attainable. I'm an attainathon. Can I sleep now?
SPIKE	You listen to me. I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I'd prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker; I follow my blood, which does not always rush in the direction of my head. So I've made a lot of mistakes. A lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred plus years, only one thing I've ever been sure of. You.
BUFFY	I don't... I don't want to be the one.
SPIKE	I don't want to be this good-looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear.
BUFFY	Spike?
BUFFY	No. I mean... here. Would you just... hold me?
FIRST	Deep down, you've always wanted Buffy to accept you -- to love you, even. Why do you think that is?
FAITH	You a shrink now?
FIRST	You keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these "friends" of yours. But you're never going to find it. The truth is, nobody will ever love you. Not the way I love you.
FAITH	Get out.
FIRST	They'll forever see you as a killer.
FAITH	I said get out.
FIRST	I'll always be with you, firecracker. In everything you do.
FAITH	Shouldn't sneak up like that. Almost took your head off.
WOOD	Sorry. I knocked -
FAITH	What'd you see?
WOOD	Just you looking spooked. What happened?
FAITH	Nothing. Forget it. What's up?
WOOD	I was just going to fill you in on our weapons status.
FAITH	So - fill. Go.
WOOD	We need more. You sure you're alright?
FAITH	What? You want to rap about my problems? You hopin' to be the guy who puts the pal in principal for me?
WOOD	Okay... I came up to talk weapons; I see you, you... look kinda upset, and I ask if you're okay. Where exactly did I go wrong?
FAITH	Sorry; I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just --
WOOD	I'll leave you alone. Didn't mean to intrude.
WOOD	You're really in the game now. First doesn't show unless it thinks you matter.
FAITH	Lucky me. I'm a player.
WOOD	But that's what The First does. Find your achilles heel.
FAITH	Naw. It just talked to me. It does a heel thing too?
WOOD	It's a phrase. Your weak spot.
FAITH	Ah. The school thing. I was kinda absent that decade.
WOOD	So, who was it -- The First?
FAITH	He was... like, an old boss of mine.
WOOD	Just a boss? And seein' him make's you shake like that? Wouldn't give you a raise, huh?
FAITH	Yeah, right? Nah. I know it sounds retarded, but he was like a dad to me.
WOOD	Oh. It was my mother. When it came to me. And, I mean, it was her. Right down to the perfume: patchouli and lilac.
FAITH	Sorry.
WOOD	Yeah.
FAITH	I'm just pissed at myself. I knew it was a trick...
WOOD	So did I. And I still wanted my mama to hold me like a little baby. In a manly way. Of course.
FAITH	Of course.
WOOD	Nobody wants to be alone, Faith. We all want someone who cares. To be touched that way. The First may deal in figments - but the wanting is real.
FAITH	Hitting things and a whole lotta Jack D dulls it some.
WOOD	Among other things.
FAITH	When it came to you, did The First tell you the truth?
WOOD	Yes.
FAITH	It said that we've got to watch out for Buffy. That Buffy's dangerous.
WOOD	What do you think?
FAITH	Could be. We've given B a mighty reason to be pissed off. The messed-up thing? The First is telling me to worry about her - and I just wish she was here. In a couple of hours, I'm leading these girls into some serious crap. And she's the only one...
WOOD	She's not the only one. You're a slayer too. And I think you're a leader.
FAITH	I'm an ex-con that didn't finish high school.
WOOD	I'm the principal of a school that nobody finished. And I'm totally out my league in this.
FAITH	I hear otherwise.
WOOD	So, tomorrow --
FAITH	Forget about tomorrow. This is tonight.
WOOD	Hey. You're the leader.
KENNEDY	Looks like there's only one girl here.
WILLOW	But what about the other ones, with their sleeping bags and their head- gear and their snoring and... (smiling big) They're not here, are they?
KENNEDY	Nope.
WILLOW	No, no I just... I guess I'm kinda scared.
KENNEDY	It's probably to stupid to ask why, huh? Death, war, apocalypse --
WILLOW	Me.
KENNEDY	And then, isn't that the good part?
WILLOW	Yeah, good. Good feeling. But also...
KENNEDY	Bad stuff like unrestrained moaning and screaming with joy?
WILLOW	Well, yeah. Sort of. Yeah, with the unrestrained of it. I've been in a place where I kinda should be restrained. I've been controlling myself and if I get out of control... if I let myself go, I could just... go.
KENNEDY	You're worried you're going to turn into Big Bad Willow.
WILLOW	It's not stupid. When we kissed, I turned into a... Warren.
KENNEDY	It's not stupid. But it's not going to happen. C'mon...
WILLOW	I don't know...
KENNEDY	I guess, I -- I just want you to know that you're safe with me.
WILLOW	Yeah?
KENNEDY	I'll keep you safe. You can float around and I'll tether you down.
WILLOW	You'll be, like, my kite string?
KENNEDY	You be a kite and I'll be your kite string. Okay?
WILLOW	Okay.
ANYA	They could have a little respect, you know.
XANDER	Mmmmmm.
XANDER	Mmmmmm.
ANYA	It's disgusting is what it is.
XANDER	Little jealous, huh?
ANYA	Well, of course! A lot jealous. If you and I are done having sex, I think everyone else should just knock it off.
FIRST	Isn't that the strangest thing?
CALEB	Well, it does throw me a tad... they're just, well they're barely more than animals, feeding off each others flesh. It's nauseating. But you, you're everywhere. You're in the hearts of little children, in the souls of the rich, you're the fire that makes people kill and hate, the cleansing fire that will cure the world of weakness. They're just sinners. You are Sin.
FIRST	I do like your sermons.
CALEB	And you're in me. Gave me strength no man can have.
FIRST	You're the only man strong enough to be my vessel. And I know you feel me, but I... I know why they grab at each other. To feel. I want to feel. I want to put my hands around an innocent neck and feel it crack. I want to bite off a young girl's face and feel the skin and gristle slither down my throat.
CALEB	Now that is truly poetical.
FIRST	We have to kill them.
CALEB	We are.
FIRST	We have to do it faster.
CALEB	Amen.
ANDREW	So it turned out that all these stone tablets basically said the same thing. The First and Caleb are trying to protect something. We don't know exactly what, but it's something powerful and they don't want the Slayers to get it. I'm thinking it could be a weapon and if we are looking for an arsena --
FAITH	You're not coming.
ANDREW	If one is looking for an arsenal, Well, what better place to find a --
FAITH	Weapon. Okay, got it. Good. Good thinking, Andrew.
ANDREW	It's a pleasure, Faith. Back to you.
FAITH	Enough. Okay, I need you four to suss out the low-down on B.
WOOD	Where do you want me, Faith?
FAITH	By your phone. I'll call you when I need you.
DAWN	What are we looking for, I mean, is there some reason we should... spy on Buffy?
FAITH	We're just making sure she's okay.
CALEB	It shouldn't be long now. Prophesies say one thing but brute strength says another. We'll get it out.
FIRST	I heard you Caleb.
CALEB	We're almost there.
CALEB	Well, if it ain't the prodigal Slayer...
BUFFY	So where's it at? I'm gonna find it sooner or later.
CALEB	No you're not. I lay a hand on you and you're just a dead little girl.
BUFFY	So lay a hand on me. If you can.
CALEB	Do you have to look like that?
FIRST	Will you concentrate?
CALEB	It's just a little confusing.
FIRST	Fine. Go. Kill.
AMANDA	Do you think there's rats down here? This one summer my cousin and I dissected this dead rat we found in the basement. It was so creepy, oh boy --
KENNEDY	Amanda.
CALEB	You whore.
BUFFY	Y'know, you should really watch your language. Someone who didn't know you might think you were a woman- hating prick.
VI	There's not much here actually. Not really a full arsenal, more of just an --
AMANDA	Arse? Heh, heh. Good one.

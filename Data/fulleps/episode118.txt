ANDREW	They're getting to the gate!
WARREN	I see it, I see it.
ANDREW	We're gonna lose them.
JONATHAN	We need that disk.
WARREN	Wait.
SPIKE	How you doin'?
BUFFY	Fine. You know... Same old same old.
SPIKE	(re: the dangling vamp) Here, I could take care of this guy if you want.
BUFFY	Whatever. Your call.
SPIKE	I mean, sure he don't look like much...
VAMP	Hey hey!
SPIKE	... but I'd wager he could give you a bit o'nasty. I'll save you the staking. All you gotta do is--
BUFFY	I'm not telling my friends about us.
SPIKE	Right. Well, I'll just be dropping him down to you then?
BUFFY	You tell them if you want. Go ahead. Rock the boat. Rock and roll it the hell over. My friends and I'll still be groovin' with the movin'.
SPIKE	(calling after her) In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?
BUFFY	Because I don't love you.
SPIKE	Like Hell.
TARA	Hey!
WILLOW	Look at you. All coming-out-of-class and everything.
TARA	I do that sometimes. Usually at the end part of the class.
WILLOW	Right.
TARA	(pointing awkwardly at Willow's neck) How's your... you know, after the basement deal?
WILLOW	It's between a hitch and a kink. With a side of twinge. It's okay.
TARA	And Buffy's okay too? Enjoying the refreshing sanity and so forth?
WILLOW	Ha! Yes! Refreshing san-- that's funny! She's okay. A little... freaked. I'm glad she didn't hurt you.
TARA	You too.
WILLOW	Uh, I didn't...
TARA	Only this time you stuck around.
WILLOW	Oh, um... various sounds of hesitation...
TARA	She was just a friend.
WILLOW	Friends are nice!
TARA	You rushed off before I could, you know, explain.
WILLOW	Officially, of course, I have to say that I have no idea what you're talking about.
TARA	Unofficially?
WILLOW	We should get coffee some time. Maybe some day this week after class.
TARA	I'm free tomorrow.
WILLOW	You could, you could bring your friend.
TARA	I wasn't gonna -- I mean, if you have a friend --
WILLOW	No! I'm, oh, I'm friendless.
TARA	Yeah, yeah. No friends -- I mean, I have friends....
WILLOW	Many dear friends, yeah. But --
TARA	Coffee.
WILLOW	With us. Who are... just friends.
BUFFY	Okay... can we go in that one?
DAWN	Three pairs of earrings, a change purse and a toothbrush.
BUFFY	You stole a toothbrush?
DAWN	Mother of pearl handle. Very fancy.
BUFFY	Yeah, but you stole a toothbrush . As rebellious teenagers go, you're kinda square.
DAWN	Dental hygiene is important.
BUFFY	I guess this was a kinda lame idea for a sisters-day-out. I make up for trying to kill you by taking you places you can't go in.
DAWN	No, it's my bad. I'm the one that got busted for taking stuff.
BUFFY	Hey, you didn't steal anything from the pet store, did you?
DAWN	Pocketful of goldfish. Didn't work out. No.
BUFFY	Good, then we can go look at the puppies.
DAWN	Ach. It's so awful, the puppy mills, and keeping them in those cages, people poking at them all day.
BUFFY	Yeah, but... puppies. You used to think they were cute.
DAWN	Well. yeah, I did in my fives and sixes... We could go look. 'Sides, I don't think there are any other stores left where I can show my face.
BUFFY	It'll pass. You've returned all the stuff you still had. We're paying for the rest.
DAWN	I'm paying for the rest.
BUFFY	We'll figure it out. And, you know, maybe in a couple months they'll let us visit the leather birthday jacket.
DAWN	No, no. I'm sorry.
BUFFY	I would never --
DAWN	I know. You weren't you.
BUFFY	Okay, you know what we need?
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	(re: food court ahead) Warm chocolate chip cookies. Just as warm as puppies, and somewhat tastier.
JONATHAN	Get back. You don't want to make me rush this.
WARREN	Not impressed, Padawan . When do we hit paydirt?
JONATHAN	I do this wrong, it's gonna surge and we'll be deader than an ex-girlfriend.
WARREN	What did you say?
JONATHAN	Just let me work.
WARREN	All right, do what you need to do. You get us to the goods, then watch out. It's gonna be like the whole world just spread open and gave it up for you, man.
JONATHAN	And then we're done, right? We each take our share and we call it a day?
WARREN	You that ready to get rid of us, huh?
ANDREW	I sorta feel kinda sorry for him.
WARREN	That's a weakness.
ANDREW	Um... okay.
WARREN	Look at him!
ANDREW	He's got that same look on his face, the one he had that time I highlighted in his Babylon 5 novels.
WARREN	We don't need to. Not for much longer.
ANDREW	It's gonna be that soon?
WARREN	The milk in the fridge? How long 'til it expires?
ANDREW	Well, we got it on Friday. I remember noticing that there wasn't a full two weeks on it, but we did get it into the fridge pretty quick, unless I'm thinking of the two- percent...
WARREN	Forget it. It was a thing. It's gonna be soon.
ANDREW	Oh. Wow.
XANDER	Oh my God.
XANDER	How are you?
ANYA	Um, ducky. You?
XANDER	Ahn. Please. Let me --
I	can't -- sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I'm like, oh God, is this my life? Was that me?
ANYA	Me too.
XANDER	But you have to believe me, please, that I want to make up for it, I want to take away the hurt, I love you. So much.
ANYA	I just don't understand what happened.
XANDER	I do. I'm an idiot.
ANYA	Say something... about what?
XANDER	No, no, I mean, you know, if I had been more, like, self-aware.
ANYA	If you had been more self-aware, you would have, what? been able to stop the wedding?
XANDER	I don't mean it like that, it's more like...
ANYA	Do you still want to get married?
XANDER	Ahn, it's a very complicated question.
ANYA	Actually, it's really not. Kind of an either-or deal. Do you want to get married?
XANDER	Someday, yes, very much.
I	love you so much, I'm just trying to be honest with you --
ANYA	Yes, honesty now . Congratulations, Xander, for being honest now, I wonder what the medal will say.
XANDER	Okay, clearly I'm not handling this well.
ANYA	Well, duh.
XANDER	All I want is for us to be together. I love you. I just wish we could go back to the way things were before.
ANYA	And I wish you were never born!
XANDER	I know this is all coming out wrong.
ANYA	I -- I wish you felt the pain of a thousand searing pokers boiling your heart in its own juices!
XANDER	I know, honey. I totally deserve that.
ANYA	I wish you lived in a state of constant panic! I wish you had tentacles where your beady eyes should be! I wish your intestines were twisted into knots and ripped apart inside your lousy gut!
XANDER	They are.
ANYA	Really? Right now?
XANDER	God, yes. It hurts so bad it's killing me. Anya, I love you. I want to make this work.
ANYA	Those are metaphor intestines! You're not in real pain! (to herself) What's wrong with me?
XANDER	It's not you, honey. It's me. I'm the one that --
ANYA	Gaggghh!!
XANDER	Ahn, wait. Please...
HALFREK	...no child support in, like, eleven years, not a single check, so now, every time he picks up a piece of paper that isn't a check for the child? Paper cut.
ANYA	Hmmmm?
HALFREK	Okay, did they not have listening skills in Human World?
ANYA	I'm sorry. I know. I'm just distracted.
HALFREK	What, this thing with Xander? Don't worry, you'll find a way --
ANYA	No, that's just it, I tried everything, every curse I knew, nothing worked.
HALFREK	Wait. You tried to curse him yourself?
ANYA	Well, yeah. I'm the wronged party here, of course I --
HALFREK	You can't exact justice against someone on behalf of yourself , silly! How long have you been away?
ANYA	I haven't been scorned by a man in, like, a thousand years. I never had to make a wish for myself. Isn't there some way around that?
HALFREK	Well... You could try getting someone to make the wish for you. I suppose.
DAWN	Uh, gosh. Did we open a chain? Are we the International House of something?
BUFFY	Got up early, seemed like a breakfast kind of morning, what kind of syrup you want on your pancakes?
DAWN	Syrup comes in kinds?
BUFFY	You know, I was thinking, after the mall yesterday, maybe staying in tonight might be kinda cool, so whaddya think of, like, a big video and pizza night?
DAWN	Um...
BUFFY	Oh, and do you have plans this weekend? 'Cause I was thinking maybe we could try to get to --
DAWN	Hey, I'm gonna be okay with the basement thing. Really.
BUFFY	This isn't guilt. I want us to spend time.
DAWN	Okay. Good. I like spending time --
BUFFY	But I'm cramping your teenage style.
DAWN	No --
BUFFY	I am. I'm the embarrassing mom who tries too hard. When did this happen?
DAWN	No, you're not, it's not that, it's, see, instead of you hanging out with me, maybe... maybe I could hang out with you.
BUFFY	Uh huh. And then maybe we'll invite over some strangers and ask them to feed you candy.
DAWN	You guys all went out patrolling every night when you were my age.
BUFFY	Yes, well, technically, you're one- and-a-half.
DAWN	I just... I just think I could help.
BUFFY	I'm sure you could. But it's more dangerous than I had in mind.
DAWN	But --
BUFFY	Dawn. I'm trying so hard to keep you away from that stuff. I don't want you to be around dangerous things that can kill you.
DAWN	Which would be a perfectly reasonable argument if my sister was chosen to protect the world from tax audits. But my sister is, see, you, and dangerous things that can kill me seem to find me.
BUFFY	But you don't have to go looking for them. Eat up. You'll be late for school.
TARA	Okay, wait, it was under her wig?
WILLOW	It was this thing, and it came out from inside her head.
TARA	That's disgusting. What did it look like?
WILLOW	Well... let's put it this way. If I wasn't gay before...
TARA	Gah. And this was after the invisible ray?
WILLOW	Yes.
TARA	Okay, I go away for a couple of months...
WILLOW	Oh, did I tell you about the demon eggs?
TARA	See, now I know you're just trying to make me jealous.
WILLOW	So, what, no rollicking adventures in the dorms?
TARA	It's not the same. It's not like living in a house full of family or sharing a room with someone you... you know...
WILLOW	Are friends with?
ANYA	Hey.
WILLOW	Oh my god. You're back.
TARA	We've been so worried.
ANYA	Sorry. I just needed to... I couldn't stay here. Not after that.
TARA	No! No, we totally understand.
WILLOW	But you're back now. Right?
ANYA	It's... complicated.
WILLOW	If there's anything we can do, just let us --
ANYA	Actually, there is an eensy something I could use a little help with. You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy.
DAWN	He feels awful.
ANYA	You think it's anywhere close to what I feel?
DAWN	No, but --
ANYA	What if it were you, Dawn? What if all you dreamed about was that magical day? The day when the one person you loved with all your soul would promise to cherish and protect your heart for the rest of his life? But instead he shatters it into a million jagged pieces. Bet you'd wish he'd feel more than just a weensy awful, wouldn't you?
BUFFY	I don't think he could feel any worse.
ANYA	Let's test that theory.
BUFFY	Anya, Xander's my friend. I know what he did was wrong and if it had happened to me I'd --
ANYA	-- wish his penis would explode?
TARA	It's not really so much about hating the men.
WILLOW	We're more centered around the girl on girl action.
ANYA	And men really like to watch that kind of stuff, don't they? Men like Xander.
TARA	Well, I --
ANYA	Don't you wish his eyes would explode?
DAWN	I never use that word anymore.
ANYA	Coagulate?
DAWN	W-i-s-h.
ANYA	Oh, wish? As in I wish Xander --
DAWN	Right! That word. There's vengeance demons out there that are still active, remember. Any 'I wish' could totally end in horrible grossness.
ANYA	Gimme a fer-instance.
BUFFY	I don't really think I should --
ANYA	Did I mention the whole "left at the altar" thing? Didn't leave that out, did I?
BUFFY	No, I know what he did was wrong. God. I can't imagine -- It must have been torture.
ANYA	Okay! Let's talk about torture!
ANYA	Tell me more about wishing Xander's guts and brains would go blooey.
DAWN	I didn't say that.
ANYA	Yes you did.
DAWN	No I didn't.
ANYA	I heard you.
DAWN	I swear, I didn't say that.
ANYA	Didn't say what?
DAWN	Um, I just saw you were back and wanted to talk about working off my debt. You know, my whole Sticky- Fingers-Grabby-Hands-thing?
ANYA	Oh! Right, the mad thieving. Good, yes, there 's much to do. I'm gonna put you to work, missy!
ANYA	Squish squish squish! Guys have been running roughshod over you for years. Torturing that perky little ticker. Aren't you sick of it? Don't you wish guys like that --
BUFFY	Whoa, what guys ? There have only been four -- three! Only three guys! That's barely plural.
ANYA	And didn't each of them rip your heart out? Don't men like that, as to pick an example, Xander , deserve to be punished?
WILLOW	Well, Xander is a man, so it's kinda not the surprise that he likes to watch... Girls... Why are we talking about this?
ANYA	We're comforting me.
TARA	Well, I guess it's natural for guys to be interested in --
ANYA	God! What kind of lesbian are you?! If you love men so much, go love men!
BUFFY	Anya, I know you're hurting, but --
ANYA	What? Xander doesn't deserve to suffer for what he did because he's your friend? And I'm not. Right. I get it.
BUFFY	No, that's not what I'm saying. What he did was wrong. He knows that.
ANYA	It just -- it hurts. He hurt me so much.
BUFFY	I know. He really did. I wish...
ANYA	Congratulations. They all still love you. Even after what you did to me.
XANDER	Anya, wait...
BUFFY	Okay. Not crazy about that idea.
XANDER	What are you doing? I have to go after her.
BUFFY	Or, in the Land of the Sane, you could give her some space and let her cool down.
XANDER	That's not Proactive Guy. That's Sit- Around-And-Wait-For-The-Rest-of-His- Life-To-Turn-To-Crap Guy.
BUFFY	True, but Crap Guy gets to keep all his appendages.
XANDER	So I'm just supposed to what? Walk away? That shouldn't be too hard. It's what I'm good at, isn't it?
BUFFY	Okay, see, this is why a heart to heart isn't your best course of action here. You're both upset and angry and what the hell is that creepy little thing doing in my yard? Did Willow put that there when I was dead? 'Cause if I had known, I would have crawled out of the grave sooner to kick her --
XANDER	Buffy.
BUFFY	Oh my God.
XANDER	(re: the front door) Looks like someone's been keeping an eye on all your ins and outs.
BUFFY	What the -- who --
XANDER	Okay, well, let's see. Who's obsessed with Buffy? Who likes to hang out here in the yard and keep an eye on her? Who's the guy in love with you but not getting any?
SPIKE	What's this?
BUFFY	It's a camera.
SPIKE	Yeah, I got that part. Why am I holding it?
BUFFY	Someone was using it to spy on me. On the house. Xander thinks it might've been you.
SPIKE	Oh, the great Xander thinks so! Shudder gasp! It must be true!
BUFFY	Spike --
SPIKE	That ponce has always had it for me. Every chance he gets, he sticks it --
BUFFY	Yeah, righteous indignation is absolutely the way to go here, 'cause you don't kill or lie or steal or manipulate --
SPIKE	I don't hurt you .
BUFFY	I know.
SPIKE	No, you don't. I've tried to make it clear to you, but you won't see it. Something happened to me. The way I feel... about you... It's different. No matter how hard you try to convince yourself it isn't. It's real.
BUFFY	I think it is. For you.
SPIKE	Get out.
ANYA	No, they're all, oh, poor Xander, it took so much out of him, all that running away he did. I just don't understand what's wrong with these people.
HALFREK	Did you really think they were the ones to help you?
ANYA	But --
HALFREK	Do you want retribution, Anyanka?
ANYA	I want Xander good and cursed.
HALFREK	Then you know what you have to do.
ANYA	Get a wish from someone who doesn't freaking love him.
HALFREK	Exactly.
ANYA	Yeah, but my social circle is a little limited here, what am I supposed to do, just stumble upon someone who doesn't give a fig's ass if Xander gets hurt?
SPIKE	Hey. I need a thing.
ANYA	So... what's your pleasure?
SPIKE	Fresh of out of pleasure. That's why I'm here. I need something. Numbing spell, maybe?
ANYA	Uh huh. Hang on.
I	could get him to wish -- (catching herself) Dammit, if only he were a woman. Okay, got it! If I can somehow get someone to wish that Spike were a woman, then I go to him, well, he'd be a her by then, go to her and get her to --
HALFREK	Anyanka. There's an easier way. I know you've got this whole Female Power, Take Back the Night thing, and I think that's cute, but I've been telling you for decades men need a little vengeance now and then, too.
ANYA	Oh.
HALFREK	Maybe this is your chance to try it out.
SPIKE	Sorry to bust up the little girls' night out.
ANYA	No problem. I'm ready to do business.
SPIKE	Right then. Got something that'll dull the ache a bit?
ANYA	Actually, yes. Giles left a couple of supplies here, and I think I know just the thing to help.
BUFFY	(re: the screen) How's it coming? Can you see who's getting the camera's signal?
WILLOW	Should have something once I get tapped into the fiber-optic network. We're gonna use the feedback relay to get their signal routed into our system.
XANDER	If it's not Spike, and I'm not saying I believe him, but if it's not Spike, I think we already know who's behind this.
BUFFY	Yeah. But it's not the who I want. It's the where.
WILLOW	(as she types) Can't help thinking maybe you were closer than you thought that day you went out with the addresses.
BUFFY	And they sent the Psycho Demon to interrupt me.
WILLOW	Makes sense.
BUFFY	I want. To find. These guys.
JONATHAN	Uncover.
WARREN	Well, now that we've --
JONATHAN	Yah!
SPIKE	...and then this girl says "real for you-"
ANYA	Right, but getting back to Xander-
SPIKE	Xander. Let's not waste any more breath on that wanker-
ANYA	It's just, he made a fool of me, and nobody seems to care enough to do anything.
SPIKE	I care. What he did to you, I've never stooped that low, and I'm an "evil, souless thing" according to some people-
ANYA	But shouldn't he pay? Don't you wish he had to pay in some horrible way?
SPIKE	Absolutely. (re: chip) Take him on myself if it wasn't for my little handicap.
ANYA	Right. So - hypothetically - what do you wish you could do to him?
SPIKE	You name it, pet. You're the wronged party. Something gruesome, how 'bout?
JONATHAN	(looking over) Hey! That's my blanket!
WARREN	Well, makes sense, it was your fire.
JONATHAN	But --
WILLOW	Hey. Hey, I think I got something!
ANYA	...thing about it is, none of this was my idea. I didn't ask to be human-
SPIKE	Right! An' I didn't ask for this bloody chip in my head-
ANYA	To tell the truth, all I wanted was to use him and lose him. I hadn't had a good tumble in a thousand years-
SPIKE	Me too. The using part. I just wanted to know what I was missing, move on.
ANYA	Then he was all bumpy in the right places and nice to me...
SPIKE	She was so raw. Never felt anything like it...
ANYA	Next thing I know, I'm changing to please him. I care if he cares.
SPIKE	Right.
ANYA	I'm off my guard. Happy. I'm singing in the shower and doing my sexy dance-
SPIKE	Exact- (catches himself) I have no dance.
BUFFY	Talk to me, Will.
WILLOW	Technology's pretty sophisticated, lots of booby traps and firewall stuff...
XANDER	Nerds.
WILLOW	Oh, yeah. But, you know, who is the bigger nerd, the nerd, or the nerd who breaks through his defense system? (not looking up) Okay, no one answer that, please.
BUFFY	But can you get us a location?
WILLOW	(of course I can) Hey. I'm still me. Just one -- whoa.
BUFFY	What? What?
WILLOW	There are other cameras.
ANYA	Screw em!
SPIKE	To the rafters!
ANYA	I did everything for that man. Was it ever enough?
SPIKE	Never! I was always going above and beyond. I saved the Scoobies how many times? And I can't stand the lot of you.
ANYA	Me either! I hate us! Everybody's So "nice." Nobody speaks their mind.
SPIKE	You do.. That's why you're the only one of them I wouldn't bite if I had the chance.
ANYA	Really?
SPIKE	Absolutely. I have nothing but respect for a woman who is forthright. Drusilla was always straightforward. Didn't have a single buggering clue about what was going on right in front of her, but she was straight about it. That's a virtue.
ANYA	Xander didn't think so. He thought I was rude.
SPIKE	That's because he's one of them. Uptight. Repressed.
ANYA	You think?
SPIKE	Please. It's no wonder they couldn't deal with the likes of you and me, Luv. We both should have been dead hundreds of years ago - and we're the only ones that are really alive.
WARREN	But you saw where we were supposed to go, right?
JONATHAN	Yeah, I saw it.
WILLOW	Oh my God. The Double Meat Palace. The Bronze. My classrooms on campus, Xander's site...
BUFFY	What?
WILLOW	I can tell there are more feeds, I'm just having a harder time pinpointing 'em. Here, lemme...
SPIKE	Here. Ladies last.
ANYA	Thank you.
SPIKE	Take it quick or my chivalry'll run out.
ANYA	No - thank you.
SPIKE	Intimately.
ANYA	This whole time, I've been coming on all hell bent and mad. Wanting his head you know?
SPIKE	Yeah.
ANYA	When, really, I can't sleep at night, thinking - it has to be my fault, somehow-
SPIKE	Shhhhh-
ANYA	I mean, what if he was just pretending? What if he never really wanted me, I mean the way I wanted... Oh, God... I'm sorry.
SPIKE	Now now...
ANYA	Then why?
SPIKE	The two of them, they're weak is all. Tell you one thing. They're going to miss the water now that the well's gone dry.
ANYA	Too hot to handle.
SPIKE	Too hot...
ANYA	I have one more question-
SPIKE	Hmmmmm.
ANYA	Can I see your sexy dance?
SPIKE	I'll show you mine...
ANYA	Wait. Wait. What are we doing-
SPIKE	Moving on.
WILLOW	Here, I think there are a couple more transmitters on the network, I've almost got us tapped into picture on 'em.
ANYA	You know I'm only doing this 'cause I'm lonely and I'm drunk and you smell good.
SPIKE	See? Forthright.
ANDREW	Hey. Wait.
WILLOW	I think I got the Magic Box --
WARREN	No! Shut it down! Shut it all down!
ANDREW	I'm trying, I can't find --
JONATHAN	Here, dorkface, you have to --
ANDREW	I'll get it myself-
WARREN	Guys, we have to -- holy crap.
JONATHAN	Oh my God.
WARREN	Is that the cam in the Magic Box?
JONATHAN	Oh my God.
ANDREW	What are they... oh.
WARREN	Is that --
JONATHAN	Spike.
ANDREW	(intent on the screen) He is so cool... And, I mean, the girl is hot. Too.
WARREN	Dude.
BUFFY	What?
WILLOW	Wait, Xander, no.
XANDER	Oh, God.
DAWN	Hey' guys, what's --
XANDER	I -- what is she -- ?
WILLOW	Buffy...
BUFFY	That's enough.
WILLOW	(snapping to) Here, lemme...
DAWN	So... This is it. This is the stuff you've been protecting me from? You and Spike?
BUFFY	And a lot of monsters.
DAWN	Uh huh.
BUFFY	But it's over. Spike.
DAWN	I wish you'd told me.
BUFFY	I kinda didn't admit it to myself.
DAWN	I get that.
BUFFY	What?
DAWN	I'm sure he's just confused-
BUFFY	Confused? No! Dawn - I did the breaking up. Spike was obsessed with me .
DAWN	Oh. I just thought-
BUFFY	I'm serious. He was acting like a total stalker-
WILLOW	Buffy. Xander's gone. And he took your axe.
XANDER	Get up. Get up!
SPIKE	Not gonna fight you. Chip.
XANDER	Too bad.
ANYA	Xander, no! Stop it! Stop it!
XANDER	Don't even try to deny it. 'Cause we saw it all. The whole, beautiful show.
ANYA	How...
BUFFY	Didn't take long, did it?
XANDER	(ignoring them) O-oh! Okay... then you had to do it. Because he was there. Like Mt. Everest. Like I used to be.
ANYA	And then you weren't. You left me, Xander. At the altar. I don't owe you anything.
XANDER	So you bang the first body you can find? Dead or alive?
ANYA	Where do you get off judging me-
XANDER	When this is your solution to our problems? I hurt you so you get me back? Very mature.
ANYA	No, the mature solution is to spend your whole life telling stupid, pointless jokes so no one will notice you're just a scared, insecure little boy!
XANDER	I'm not joking now. You let that evil, soulless thing touch you. You wanted me to feel something, congratulations. It worked.
SPIKE	Good enough for Buffy.
XANDER	Shut up. Leave her out of...
ANYA	Buffy.
BUFFY	Xander--
XANDER	I don't want to know this, I don't want to know any of this.
SPIKE	Stupid tossbag. You know, I wish he would --
ANYA	Don't.
WILLOW	Tara...
TARA	You can't ever put them back the way they were...
WILLOW	Are you okay?
TARA	(crossing in, sitting) I'm sorry, it's just... you know it takes time. you can't just have coffee and expect --
WILLOW	I know.
TARA	There's so much to work through. Trust has to build again, on both sides... TARA you have to learn if you're even the same people you were, if you can fit in each other's lives, it's a long and important process and can we just skip it? Can you just be kissing me now?

XANDER	You're gonna live in that small room over there, I know it looks like a closet, but it's a room now, and you're not gonna touch my food, and I shower first in the morning, if I use up all the hot water, that's your tough noogies, and I hate this plan.
BUFFY	Invitation.
XANDER	Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan?
SPIKE	Don't want your sodding food anyway.
XANDER	I just don't understand when his problems became your problems. Or, more specifically, mine.
BUFFY	The basement at the school is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.
XANDER	Why not? Crazy-basement-guy is better than stalking-Buffy-guy.
DAWN	It's true. You guys aren't... you're not starting up again with the...
BUFFY	No. No, a gallon of no. It's just - things are different. He has a soul now.
XANDER	I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.
DAWN	Yeah - what does it even mean? That Spike is all soul-having?
BUFFY	I don't know, exactly. But he's been through a lot and nobody's attacking-
SPIKE	Buffy-
BUFFY	No. It's okay. I'm just-
SPIKE	I'll go. This can't work.
BUFFY	It will. It's already working. You've been out of the basement for half an hour and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
SPIKE	Bullocks.
BUFFY	Okay. So there was that one episode in the car-
SPIKE	No - bullocks to this whole thing. I don't need you mollycoddling-
BUFFY	It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.
BUFFY	What's what?
DAWN	Last night you said that you weren't helping Spike out of pity. So what is it?
BUFFY	You ask a good question.
DAWN	Is sitting there eating egg salad some kind of zen non-answer?
BUFFY	I just... The truth is - I don't know what I feel. I think I can't stand him, but then sometimes...
DAWN	You love him?
BUFFY	No. I feel for him.
DAWN	Feel what, exactly?
BUFFY	Dawn...
DAWN	No. I'm trying to understand. I mean, nothing makes sense. First you say Spike disgusts you but, secretly, you two are doing it like bunnies. And Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you. And I'm even trying to understand that. A little. The rape part.
BUFFY	He didn't. I mean, he tried-
DAWN	Not that. I just... You guys had sex a lot, right? It's not like you were strangers. Weren't you ever... ... being kind of rough with each other? Anya said some stuff-
BUFFY	I really should've killed her. Dawn, it was complicated. But I'd broken it off with him. I didn't want to anymore.
DAWN	Oh. Oh... That must have been... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for even asking.
BUFFY	It's okay. I get the question. I've asked it myself a few times. For the record? Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away.
DAWN	To get a soul? Like that's going to make him a better man? Xander had a soul when he stood Anya up at the alter. And now he says he still wants her. You know, I don't think it's the school basement that makes people crazy.
BUFFY	I wish I had better answers. Or ones with big words you couldn't really follow.
DAWN	It's just... it seems kind of... exhausting.
BUFFY	It truly is.
DAWN	I'm telling you, I don't get why people even bother. I mean, with all the energy they waste on chasing and having and brooding, you could cure about eight-gazillion icky diseases-
BUFFY	Bye, rant-girl.
DAWN	Or you could, like, paint beautiful murals on every ugly wall in the whole world. And then paint beautiful murals on every ugly mural in the...
CHERYL	I've been thinking about it -- I think I can still cheer. I could use a chair. We all could. Like the Laker girls.
LORI	Oh honey -- you need to concentrate on getting better. Don't worry, we'll find a replacement for you tomorrow -
CHERYL	I just feel like I let you down...
LORI	Oh. Dawn.
DAWN	I was just wondering, um, you, uh, you had Mr. Gurin for English back at your old school, right?
DAWN	I have him this year.
DAWN	Right. Right, no, I like him, I just meant, you know...
DONNELL	So the tryouts tomorrow, you are gonna make the new girls jump up and down a lot, right?
LORI	Gross, you guys. A vending machine fell on Cheryl and all you can think about are new cheerleaders?
DAWN	Oh, hey, I heard someone saying they think we're gonna go all the way to the championships this year. In football.
DONNELL	Yeah, well... if you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.
DONNELL	We'll see.
DONNELL	I'm just saying...
DAWN	The quarterback is the most important member of the team. He is the rudder that guides the ship.
CHERYL	Would you really?
LORI	Oh, she's okay. She can get it herself.
DAWN	You're all a team. We can talk later, that's cool.
CANDIDATE	Goooooooooooo Razorbacks!
LORI	Okay, awesome, thank you! Up next we have... (her face sours a bit, then recovers) Dawn Summers.
LORI	Nice outfit.
DAWN	Razorbacks, Razorbacks, we're gonna play!/We got our secret weapon, his name is R.J.!
LORI	Okay. Thank you. Very spirited.
BUFFY	Come on, Dawnie, come out. Dawn. Honey. It's not that bad-
DAWN	How would you even know? R.J. is never going to notice me now!
BUFFY	From what you said, I'm pretty sure he already noticed you. What with the falling and the-
DAWN	Go away!
BUFFY	Dawn...
XANDER	Things a lot better, I see.
BUFFY	I don't think tonight is going to be good for videos, Xand.
XANDER	Right. With the wailing and the crying. Still better than a cozy evening with Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
DAWN	It is not a snit. I finally met him, the guy of my dreams, okay? And I blew it! R.J. hates me now.
BUFFY	Dawn - what's that?
DAWN	Just the end of my life.
XANDER	Remember when she had a crush on me? I miss the much cuter me crush.
BUFFY	You shredded my outfit.
DAWN	I'll buy you a new one.
BUFFY	Not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit-
XANDER	Now, now. Let's not be hasty- Not the time for... Right.
BUFFY	Dawnie. I'm sorry you feel so bad. But this won't feel so terrible in the morning. I mean, you don't even know this R.J. Not really.
DAWN	I do know him. I know his soul.
BUFFY	Really? Cause yesterday he wasn't even on your radar-
XANDER	It's the jacket.
DAWN	It isn't a crush. It's love. I love R.J.
BUFFY	Again, since yesterday? That's awfully fast.
DAWN	What, you're telling me I don't feel what I feel?
BUFFY	Of course not, no. If you say it's love...
BUFFY	I believe it seems real. To you.
DAWN	Know what? Maybe I don't want advice from the dysfunction queen. You have no idea what I'm feeling. You have no idea what real love is. If you did you wouldn't make fun of me this way.
BUFFY	What? I'm not-
DAWN	Just - go. Leave me alone.
DONNELL	Hey, Brooks, just talked to the coach.
DONNELL	I'm starting on Saturday.
DONNELL	Just time to let someone else have a turn, man. You knew this was coming.
DAWN	You can't do this to R.J.
DONNELL	Oh hey - it's you. Nice cheering the other day.
DAWN	It isn't fair, he works so hard.
DONNELL	What do you care? This is how the game is played. It's dog eat dog -- may the best man win.
DAWN	But nobody's better than R.J.
DONNELL	Yeah, well, that's not really up to you, is it?
DAWN	It all happened so fast -- I mean, one minute he was walking, the next he stumbled... And then he fell.
BUFFY	Could you have accidentally bumped into him or something?
DAWN	No. I wasn't anywhere near him.
WOOD	Why would he say you pushed him down the stairs?
DAWN	I don't know. Maybe he was embarrassed. It's hard being clumsy. 'Specially when you're popular and athletic. I bet.
WOOD	Well, it wouldn't be the first time I caught O'Donnell in a lie, to be candid.
BUFFY	Be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.
WOOD	We can deal with that after he gets out of the hospital.
DAWN	It happened really fast. He's probably just confused.
WOOD	I suppose. Let's hope so. I'm gonna have to call Coach Wheeler and break the news. Not a conversation I wanna have.
DAWN	You mean 'cause O'Donnell was gonna start on Saturday.
WOOD	Exactly. Coach'll have to go back to the drawing board.
DAWN	Least he's still got R.J. to take over.
WOOD	Well, I think we have everything we need for now. Sorry you had to be involved in this, Dawn.
DAWN	That's okay. I'm just sorry it happened.
DAWN	Hi!
DAWN	Well, yeah.
DAWN	Yes.
DAWN	We just talked. He just needed me to tell him about the accident.
DAWN	Right. Out of nowhere.
XANDER	No, Spike definitely seems a little more cogent, less...
WILLOW	No. But maybe you start feeling really bad about leaving them there.
BUFFY	Least he's showering. That's a delightful and refreshing change...
XANDER	Buff?
BUFFY	I think that's the guy.
WILLOW	What guy?
BUFFY	The guy who, according to Dawn, is, quote, the hottest, deepest, smartest, funniest and having-of-the- thickest-boy-eyelashes boy in school. Unquote.
XANDER	He don't seem so tough.
WILLOW	Yeah, but check out the fan club.
XANDER	Hmmm. Daddy like.
BUFFY	What is that blouse made of, paint?
WILLOW	Buff --
BUFFY	No, I'm glad Dawnie isn't here to see her precious boyfriend getting all... thrusty with some slut-bag hussy --
XANDER	Oh. Oh! No. Daddy - no! I wasn't... When I was looking, I wasn't... Oh, God.
WILLOW	Right there with ya.
BUFFY	So, you have plans for later, or you just gonna go down to the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	Where do I start with the bad? First - you said you were going to the library. Second - you don't go on a date without informing me first. And third - Anna Nicole Smith thinks you look tacky.
DAWN	I think I look hot. And so does R.J.
BUFFY	I bet be does. You know, maybe I should have a word with him-
DAWN	No! Don't you dare embarrass me in front of him!
BUFFY	I don't like this, Dawn. This guy has you acting crazy.
DAWN	Like you've never dressed up for a guy?
BUFFY	Not this way, no.
DAWN	Please! Besides - it's my life. I'll do what I want to.
BUFFY	I don't think so-
DAWN	Oh, so what, suddenly you're Mom now --
BUFFY	No, I'm not, and I'm glad she isn't here to see you like this.
DAWN	You just can't handle it.
BUFFY	What?
DAWN	You've always been the special one. Hot Buffy with the boyfriends - the Slayer. And now, somebody likes me. And you can't stand that I'm getting attention.
BUFFY	That's not true-
DAWN	It is. And I'm sorry, but I like the way R.J. makes me feel. I don't care if you think that makes me a slut or whatever!
BUFFY	You're not going back out on that dance floor.
DAWN	R.J.?
LORI	I saw you. I saw you with R.J.
DAWN	So? We were just dancing.
LORI	Right. I'm not stupid, you know.
DAWN	You know what's sad? A girl who can't move on when she's been dumped.
LORI	He didn't dump me!
BUFFY	First with the lap dance, now with the cat fight. Hey - wanna get drunk and barf next?
DAWN	Let me go! This isn't finished!
LORI	I'll never let you have him, bitch!
BUFFY	Well. At least someone agrees you shouldn't be dating this guy.
WOOD	... how about if you tried doing your own homework, no more getting all these impressionable young women in your classes to do it for you. Avoid detention? Sound good?
WOOD	O sweet, infectious enthusiasm!
BUFFY	Whoa, hang on there, Slappy. Not done with you yet.
I	got that guy riding my back all the time, now I gotta deal with you too?
BUFFY	I'm actually a bit more formidable than Mr. Wood, you might come to look fondly on his back-riding.
BUFFY	Sit.
BUFFY	Not the homework, Mr. Wizard. The girls. What you're doing to them. In specific, my sister.
BUFFY	aaAAAAHHHH! No more with the talky!
I	just get along really well with girls.
BUFFY	Yeah. I see how you get along. Oooh, look at me, I'm a big quarterback...
BUFFY	No. I know. But you're a leader. A captain. People look up to you and you have to keep that in mind whenever... (trails off, thinking) I bet you have to run a lot.
BUFFY	I get that. I really do. I'm there. Or, I was there, when I was in high school. Which I was. Just a couple years ago, really. I just realized, I'm basically the same age as you, not really older. At all, actually. Just like you. But with the sexual experience and stuff. R.J. I think I hear what you're saying...
BUFFY	Right. I'm glad we had this talk. You should probably... get to class.
DAWN	Ambush.
BUFFY	I just want to tell you I talked to R.J.
DAWN	You met him? Buffy, what did you do?
BUFFY	He happened to be in the office. We said a few words. And he's okay. I think he likes you.
DAWN	Really? Tell me what he said about me. Every word. Include intonation and facial expressions.
BUFFY	He thinks you're funny and pretty and interesting. Didn't have a thing to say against you.
DAWN	Yes he did. I can tell.
BUFFY	Tiniest thing. He... He might have said you... came on a little strong.
DAWN	Oh my god. I'm the Pushy Queen of Sluttown.
BUFFY	Not at all! Just lay back a little, let him come to you.
DAWN	I'm just scared while I'm laying back some other girl will sweep him up.
BUFFY	But see, we have inside info. We know he doesn't like being swept. He wants to be the sweeper. You're gonna come out the winner here, Dawn, with me looking out for you.
DAWN	Yeah, I guess so. Thanks.
TEACHER	... but we do know that six x plus y equals sixteen, so we can solve for y in terms of --
BUFFY	Hi, sorry to interrupt. We need to see R.J. Brooks down in the guidance office.
TEACHER	Oh. Well, the lesson is just --
BUFFY	It'll just take a moment. I promise I'll have him right back to you.
BUFFY	Yes, there is. There's one of you, and there's one of me. You were the one in math class, tell me what that adds up to.
DAWN	It's not coming on too strong if I just look at him...
BUFFY	What's it really like to lead a team? It's gotta be like... being a gladiator, right? Leading warriors into battle.
BUFFY	Oh, I get that! I was, kinda, juggling some stuff in high school too, which was very recent. And it's like everyone expects you to have all this free time for studying! Principal Snyder was always on me.
BUFFY	Oh Snyder was twice the terror that Wood was. Also, half. Short. He was a little short.
BUFFY	Yeah, that would be cool.
BUFFY	Not really. But... I mean, does it bother you?
XANDER	What's wrong?
DAWN	Ugh! I don't even wanna hear his name anymore!
XANDER	I just called him that guy in the jacket.
DAWN	That's what I used to call him in my head before I knew his real name!
XANDER	Dawnie? Honey? You seem... extraordinarily perturbed. Maybe I should go get Buffy --
DAWN	No . I don't ever want to see her again.
XANDER	I thought this was about the guy in, uh, that guy with the thing.
DAWN	Now it's about both of them.
XANDER	Buffy, I think Dawn needs yaaaahhh!
BUFFY	Xander, hi, this, um, this is R.J. --
XANDER	I'm sorry, it's just, checkout time was an hour ago, we were hoping to make up the bed, and, also, this is a classroom, you chowderhead.
BUFFY	Dawn, please stop crying. Please.
XANDER	Listen, you're under a love spell. That's what this has to be. Real love wouldn't make you this irrational. At least, not this fast.
BUFFY	You're right. He's right. You're under a spell. Poor little Dawnie.
WILLOW	But we're working on it. It'll all be better soon, guys. We're zeroing in on this thing.
ANYA	Yes, soon neither one of you will be in love with this boy.
BUFFY	He's not a boy!
DAWN	What do you know about our love?! It's true and real. This isn't magic, this is my heart!
ANYA	Fine.
XANDER	We'll be working.
WILLOW	I know this feels terrible. But it isn't real. Try to hold onto that.
BUFFY	Hear that? This isn't real. You're just crazy.
DAWN	It is so real! I love him! You knew how I felt, like I'd finally found something, and you betrayed me!
BUFFY	I betrayed you? You're the one who's constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover!
DAWN	Your lover?! Your lover !
WILLOW	Guys, guys...
BUFFY	I tried to get you to back away. If you'd listened to me you wouldn't've had to see what you saw!
DAWN	That's right! You lied to me! You lied to me to get me out of the way. "Lay back." "He'll like that."
BUFFY	I was trying to be kind to you, like I always do. Did you want me to tell you that he's in love with me? That your crush is hopeless?
DAWN	It's not a crush! Stop! You're not supposed to do this.
BUFFY	Why? Because he's younger than me? I'm extremely peppy and youthful!
DAWN	No. Because you were the one I trusted.
BUFFY	Dawn! Wait!
ANYA	They're crazy little lust-puppies, aren't they?
XANDER	At least the yelling went away. It was starting to sound like Christmas morning with my family.
WILLOW	Love spells. Everyone forgets how dangerous they are.
XANDER	Hey, been there.
WILLOW	Here. Something.
BUFFY	She's locked her door. That spell has her good and loopy.
WILLOW	Info on one R.J. Brooks. Buffy hurries over.
BUFFY	Ooh. Lemme see! Is there a picture?
XANDER	Family stuff... Hey, I knew his brother. He was a big jock at Sunnydale High, too. Couple years ahead of us. Used to stick chewing gum in my hair. Huh.
WILLOW	What are you thinking?
XANDER	I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but maybe he's a way in.
BUFFY	Now look for a picture.
XANDER	I'm just saying, we're tangling with a powerful spell here, and we don't know what the deal is, so keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy...
SPIKE	What? You want me to what? Kill Xander? Why? Oh right. The endless prattling.
XANDER	Fine. Just be ready. And don't let this guy charm you either. He had everyone around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.
LANCE	Yeah?
LANCE	Construction, huh. That's awesome.
XANDER	Yeah.
LANCE	So what's up with R.J.? How's he doin' at the old alpha mater?
XANDER	Good. Just, I know a girl who might be going out with him and I was wondering...
LANCE	Got it. You wanna know if he's a good guy. Truth is, he's the best. Following in my footsteps. (over his shoulder to Spike) You might not know it now, looking at me with a couple extra pounds, but back then I was quite the guy.
XANDER	Yeah, I gather R.J.'s pretty popular too.
LANCE	Gotta tell ya, there was a time I worried about R.J. Used to be all into comic books, model UN, geek stuff. No offense, Harris. And one time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. But then he, whatchacallit... blossomed. That's what it was like.
XANDER	And do you have an idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a--
SPIKE	Here, in this picture.
LANCE	No, dude, he's wearing mine. That jacket was with me all the way through high school. Gave it to him when I graduated...
XANDER	So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?
LANCE	Oh, Dad gave it to me. Made a big deal about it, too, how he met Mom wearing that jacket. She was a former Miss Arkansas. Very hot in her day.
XANDER	Wow, that's wonderful. But it's getting late...
LANCE	Hey, you guys don't have to take off if you don't want to. I've got a sort of rumpus room set up in the basement. There's air hockey and a mini-fridge. We could party.
XANDER	We really gotta go.
WILLOW	Damn love spell. I've tried every anti-love-spell spell I can find.
ANYA	Even if you found the right one, guy would probably just do an anti-anti- love-spell-spell spell.
WILLOW	What?
WILLOW	Buffy isn't here. Go away.
ANYA	No Buffy for you. Leave quickly now.
WILLOW	Man.
ANYA	Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs. If they knew he was here.
WILLOW	But you don't even know him!
ANYA	Yes, I do! I looked into him and I saw his soul!
WILLOW	He was walking away! So unless his soul is in his ass...
ANYA	A.J. is my best friend and dearest darling.
WILLOW	It's R.J. and what you were picking up on was his deep caring and devotion to me.
ANYA	To-- What ?!
DAWN	What's going on?
ANYA	Willow thinks she's in love with my boyfriend R .J.
DAWN	What?! No! You two can't do this!
BUFFY	Willow, you're a gay woman! And he isn't!
WILLOW	This isn't about his physical presence! This is about his heart!
ANYA	But his physical presence has a penis!
WILLOW	I can work around it.
DAWN	This isn't fair! How can you all be doing this to me?
BUFFY	Wait. Everyone wait. Calm down. I know what this is.
DAWN	It isn't a spell. He owns my heart.
BUFFY	Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out and we don't need you interfering.
DAWN	But he's mine.
BUFFY	Dawnie, sweetie, go to your room, okay? This isn't about you.
WILLOW	There's an easy answer to this. Just think about who loves him most. I clearly do, since I'm, you know, looking past that whole orientation thing...
DAWN	I need him.
ANYA	You gotta do better'n that! I'd kill for him!
WILLOW	You'd kill for a chocolate bar.
BUFFY	No! Yes! Kill for him! I'm a Slayer. Slay means kill. Oh! I can kill the principal!
ANYA	Hmm. That is hard to top.
WILLOW	Yeah? Well, I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.
ANYA	Yeah, right, what are you gonna do, use magic to make him into a girl?
BUFFY	Sorry, Dawnie. You're never gonna get him.
DAWN	No. Never.
XANDER	Guys! Turns out it really is the jacket and R.J. doesn't even realize what he's got... hello? Hello?
SPIKE	Thought you said they were safe.
XANDER	Where is everybody?
WILLOW	O Hecate, I call on you./I humbly ask your will be done./Hear my request, a simple change/create a daughter from a s --
XANDER	What the hell are you doing?
WILLOW	Proving that I love R.J. the most.
XANDER	Will? Honey? R.J.'s a guy.
WILLOW	Did notice that, yeah. 'S why I'm doing my spell, 'cause, you know... he doesn't have to be.
XANDER	What? You're gonna take off his--
SPIKE	Oh. Hey.
WILLOW	I'm just making him into a woman, is all. Now hand me back those crystals, I don't have much time.
XANDER	Much time before what?
WILLOW	Before Buffy and Anya and Dawn have a chance to prove they love R.J. the most.
XANDER	And how would they do that, exactly?
WILLOW	Well, Buffy's gonna kill principal Wood --
XANDER	Fine! Okay! Let's start there!
BUFFY	What're you guys doing?
WILLOW	Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.
BUFFY	I've got a principal to kill. What's going on? Who are we looking for?
BUFFY	You realize Anya is probably seducing R.J. even as we speak.
WILLOW	Oh, God. You think so?
BUFFY	I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.
WILLOW	Well, so am I, why should I miss out?
XANDER	Hey, crazy women. Look.
BUFFY	Dawn? Dawn!
WILLOW	Buffy!
XANDER	No!
BUFFY	What were you -- what is this?
DAWN	It doesn't matter.
BUFFY	This is a plan? You're gonna steal R.J. by being tri-sected?
DAWN	There's no plan. What am I, gonna compete with you? You're older, and hotter, you have sex that's rough and kill people. I don't have any of that stuff. But if I did this, then, his whole life he'd know that there was someone who loved him so much they'd give up their life.
BUFFY	Oh, Dawn.
DAWN	And it would be true forever. I was giving him my love for forever. It was all I had.
BUFFY	Dawnie... You have so much to offer any guy. I'm just older than you. Marginally. And so, yeah, of course he wants me. But he's not important. You are. No guy is worth your life. Not ever.
DAWN	R.J. is. And don't say he isn't. Look what you were willing to do!
BUFFY	No. He's not worth it. Honey, I'd give him to you in a second if I could, that's how much you're scaring me.
DAWN	But I thought you wanted him. For you.
BUFFY	Nah. Well, yeah. My god, that boy is hot! Sorry. I think I may be under a spell here.
DAWN	I hear you.
XANDER	You're sure you understand the plan?
SPIKE	Yeah. I think I got it.
ANYA	Also, burning cotton-poly blend.
BUFFY	Be honest, Xander. You didn't think about, you know, just slipping that jacket on a little bit?
XANDER	I refuse to answer on the grounds that it didn't fit.
BUFFY	So how did R.J. take the abrupt removal of his mojo?
XANDER	He was pissed, but I don't think he got that the jacket was dosed with magic. Gonna be a rude awakening.
WILLOW	Not as rude as awakening without his parts. I can't believe I almost...
BUFFY	And I can't believe I almost-
ANYA	It was a spell. We were helpless! We aren't responsible for anything we did, morally, or, you know... legally.
XANDER	True. You fell for a mystical, ancient curse. Who here hasn't made that mistake... seven, eight times?
BUFFY	Hear that? Not your fault.
DAWN	I'm just so... The way I acted... The way I talked to you. I feel so stupid. All over a spell.
BUFFY	Get ready to feel even stupider when it's not.
WILLOW	Hey, Anya, you never told us what you "can't believe you almost-"
ANYA	Almost? Who now?
WILLOW	You can't be the only not embarrassed one. What did you do?
ANYA	Oh. I wrote a poem. Epic poem. Comparing him to a daisy and a tower and a lake-
REPORTER	...with the latest on Sunnydale's late-night bandit, who is still at large. A masked thief held up a number of businesses, including-
ANYA	Okay! Who wants ice cream? My treat.
XANDER	I just don't understand when his problems became your problems. Or, more specifically, mine.
BUFFY	The basement at the school is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.
XANDER	Why not? Crazy-basement-guy is better than stalking-Buffy-guy.
DAWN	It's true. You guys aren't... you're not starting up again with the...
BUFFY	No. No, a gallon of no. It's just - things are different. He has a soul now.
XANDER	I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.
DAWN	Yeah - what does it even mean? That Spike is all soul-having?
BUFFY	I don't know, exactly. But he's been through a lot and nobody's attacking-
SPIKE	Buffy-
BUFFY	No. It's okay. I'm just-
SPIKE	I'll go. This can't work.
BUFFY	It will. It's already working. You've been out of the basement for half an hour and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
SPIKE	Bullocks.
BUFFY	Okay. So there was that one episode in the car-
SPIKE	No - bullocks to this whole thing. I don't need you mollycoddling-
BUFFY	It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.
BUFFY	What's what?
DAWN	Last night you said that you weren't helping Spike out of pity. So what is it?
BUFFY	You ask a good question.
DAWN	Is sitting there eating egg salad some kind of zen non-answer?
BUFFY	I just... The truth is - I don't know what I feel. I think I can't stand him, but then sometimes...
DAWN	You love him?
BUFFY	No. I feel for him.
DAWN	Feel what, exactly?
BUFFY	Dawn...
DAWN	No. I'm trying to understand. I mean, nothing makes sense. First you say Spike disgusts you but, secretly, you two are doing it like bunnies. And Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you. And I'm even trying to understand that. A little. The rape part.
BUFFY	He didn't. I mean, he tried-
DAWN	Not that. I just... You guys had sex a lot, right? It's not like you were strangers. Weren't you ever... ... being kind of rough with each other? Anya said some stuff-
BUFFY	I really should've killed her. Dawn, it was complicated. But I'd broken it off with him. I didn't want to anymore.
DAWN	Oh. Oh... That must have been... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for even asking.
BUFFY	It's okay. I get the question. I've asked it myself a few times. For the record? Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away.
DAWN	To get a soul? Like that's going to make him a better man? Xander had a soul when he stood Anya up at the alter. And now he says he still wants her. You know, I don't think it's the school basement that makes people crazy.
BUFFY	I wish I had better answers. Or ones with big words you couldn't really follow.
DAWN	It's just... it seems kind of... exhausting.
BUFFY	It truly is.
DAWN	I'm telling you, I don't get why people even bother. I mean, with all the energy they waste on chasing and having and brooding, you could cure about eight-gazillion icky diseases-
BUFFY	Bye, rant-girl.
CHERYL	I've been thinking about it -- I think I can still cheer. I could use a chair. We all could. Like the Laker girls.
LORI	Oh honey -- you need to concentrate on getting better. Don't worry, we'll find a replacement for you tomorrow -
CHERYL	I just feel like I let you down...
LORI	Oh. Dawn.
DAWN	I was just wondering, um, you, uh, you had Mr. Gurin for English back at your old school, right?
DAWN	I have him this year.
DAWN	Right. Right, no, I like him, I just meant, you know...
DONNELL	So the tryouts tomorrow, you are gonna make the new girls jump up and down a lot, right?
LORI	Gross, you guys. A vending machine fell on Cheryl and all you can think about are new cheerleaders?
DAWN	Oh, hey, I heard someone saying they think we're gonna go all the way to the championships this year. In football.
DONNELL	Yeah, well... if you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.
DONNELL	We'll see.
DONNELL	I'm just saying...
DAWN	The quarterback is the most important member of the team. He is the rudder that guides the ship.
CHERYL	Would you really?
LORI	Oh, she's okay. She can get it herself.
DAWN	How would you even know? R.J. is never going to notice me now!
BUFFY	From what you said, I'm pretty sure he already noticed you. What with the falling and the-
DAWN	Go away!
BUFFY	Dawn...
XANDER	Things a lot better, I see.
BUFFY	I don't think tonight is going to be good for videos, Xand.
XANDER	Right. With the wailing and the crying. Still better than a cozy evening with Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
BUFFY	Dawn - what's that?
DAWN	Just the end of my life.
BUFFY	You shredded my outfit.
DAWN	I'll buy you a new one.
BUFFY	Not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit-
XANDER	Now, now. Let's not be hasty- Not the time for... Right.
BUFFY	Dawnie. I'm sorry you feel so bad. But this won't feel so terrible in the morning. I mean, you don't even know this R.J. Not really.
DAWN	I do know him. I know his soul.
BUFFY	Really? Cause yesterday he wasn't even on your radar-
XANDER	It's the jacket.
DAWN	It isn't a crush. It's love. I love R.J.
BUFFY	Again, since yesterday? That's awfully fast.
DAWN	What, you're telling me I don't feel what I feel?
BUFFY	Of course not, no. If you say it's love...
BUFFY	I believe it seems real. To you.
DAWN	Know what? Maybe I don't want advice from the dysfunction queen. You have no idea what I'm feeling. You have no idea what real love is. If you did you wouldn't make fun of me this way.
BUFFY	What? I'm not-
DAWN	Just - go. Leave me alone.
DONNELL	Hey, Brooks, just talked to the coach.
DONNELL	I'm starting on Saturday.
DONNELL	Just time to let someone else have a turn, man. You knew this was coming.
DONNELL	Oh hey - it's you. Nice cheering the other day.
DAWN	It isn't fair, he works so hard.
DONNELL	What do you care? This is how the game is played. It's dog eat dog -- may the best man win.
DAWN	But nobody's better than R.J.
DONNELL	Yeah, well, that's not really up to you, is it?
BUFFY	Could you have accidentally bumped into him or something?
DAWN	No. I wasn't anywhere near him.
WOOD	Why would he say you pushed him down the stairs?
DAWN	I don't know. Maybe he was embarrassed. It's hard being clumsy. 'Specially when you're popular and athletic. I bet.
WOOD	Well, it wouldn't be the first time I caught O'Donnell in a lie, to be candid.
BUFFY	Be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.
WOOD	We can deal with that after he gets out of the hospital.
DAWN	It happened really fast. He's probably just confused.
WOOD	I suppose. Let's hope so. I'm gonna have to call Coach Wheeler and break the news. Not a conversation I wanna have.
DAWN	You mean 'cause O'Donnell was gonna start on Saturday.
WOOD	Exactly. Coach'll have to go back to the drawing board.
DAWN	Least he's still got R.J. to take over.
DAWN	Hi!
DAWN	Well, yeah.
DAWN	Yes.
DAWN	We just talked. He just needed me to tell him about the accident.
DAWN	Right. Out of nowhere.
WILLOW	No. But maybe you start feeling really bad about leaving them there.
BUFFY	Least he's showering. That's a delightful and refreshing change...
BUFFY	I think that's the guy.
WILLOW	What guy?
BUFFY	The guy who, according to Dawn, is, quote, the hottest, deepest, smartest, funniest and having-of-the- thickest-boy-eyelashes boy in school. Unquote.
XANDER	He don't seem so tough.
WILLOW	Yeah, but check out the fan club.
XANDER	Hmmm. Daddy like.
BUFFY	What is that blouse made of, paint?
WILLOW	Buff --
BUFFY	No, I'm glad Dawnie isn't here to see her precious boyfriend getting all... thrusty with some slut-bag hussy --
XANDER	Oh. Oh! No. Daddy - no! I wasn't... When I was looking, I wasn't... Oh, God.
BUFFY	So, you have plans for later, or you just gonna go down to the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?
DAWN	What?
BUFFY	Where do I start with the bad? First - you said you were going to the library. Second - you don't go on a date without informing me first. And third - Anna Nicole Smith thinks you look tacky.
DAWN	I think I look hot. And so does R.J.
BUFFY	I bet be does. You know, maybe I should have a word with him-
DAWN	No! Don't you dare embarrass me in front of him!
BUFFY	I don't like this, Dawn. This guy has you acting crazy.
DAWN	Like you've never dressed up for a guy?
BUFFY	Not this way, no.
DAWN	Please! Besides - it's my life. I'll do what I want to.
BUFFY	I don't think so-
DAWN	Oh, so what, suddenly you're Mom now --
BUFFY	No, I'm not, and I'm glad she isn't here to see you like this.
DAWN	You just can't handle it.
BUFFY	What?
DAWN	You've always been the special one. Hot Buffy with the boyfriends - the Slayer. And now, somebody likes me. And you can't stand that I'm getting attention.
BUFFY	That's not true-
DAWN	It is. And I'm sorry, but I like the way R.J. makes me feel. I don't care if you think that makes me a slut or whatever!
BUFFY	You're not going back out on that dance floor.
LORI	I saw you. I saw you with R.J.
DAWN	So? We were just dancing.
LORI	Right. I'm not stupid, you know.
DAWN	You know what's sad? A girl who can't move on when she's been dumped.
LORI	He didn't dump me!
BUFFY	First with the lap dance, now with the cat fight. Hey - wanna get drunk and barf next?
DAWN	Let me go! This isn't finished!
LORI	I'll never let you have him, bitch!
WOOD	... how about if you tried doing your own homework, no more getting all these impressionable young women in your classes to do it for you. Avoid detention? Sound good?
WOOD	O sweet, infectious enthusiasm!
BUFFY	Whoa, hang on there, Slappy. Not done with you yet.
I	got that guy riding my back all the time, now I gotta deal with you too?
BUFFY	I'm actually a bit more formidable than Mr. Wood, you might come to look fondly on his back-riding.
BUFFY	Sit.
BUFFY	Not the homework, Mr. Wizard. The girls. What you're doing to them. In specific, my sister.
BUFFY	aaAAAAHHHH! No more with the talky!
BUFFY	No. I know. But you're a leader. A captain. People look up to you and you have to keep that in mind whenever... (trails off, thinking) I bet you have to run a lot.
BUFFY	I get that. I really do. I'm there. Or, I was there, when I was in high school. Which I was. Just a couple years ago, really. I just realized, I'm basically the same age as you, not really older. At all, actually. Just like you. But with the sexual experience and stuff. R.J. I think I hear what you're saying...
BUFFY	Right. I'm glad we had this talk. You should probably... get to class.
BUFFY	I just want to tell you I talked to R.J.
DAWN	You met him? Buffy, what did you do?
BUFFY	He happened to be in the office. We said a few words. And he's okay. I think he likes you.
DAWN	Really? Tell me what he said about me. Every word. Include intonation and facial expressions.
BUFFY	He thinks you're funny and pretty and interesting. Didn't have a thing to say against you.
DAWN	Yes he did. I can tell.
BUFFY	Tiniest thing. He... He might have said you... came on a little strong.
DAWN	Oh my god. I'm the Pushy Queen of Sluttown.
BUFFY	Not at all! Just lay back a little, let him come to you.
DAWN	I'm just scared while I'm laying back some other girl will sweep him up.
BUFFY	But see, we have inside info. We know he doesn't like being swept. He wants to be the sweeper. You're gonna come out the winner here, Dawn, with me looking out for you.
DAWN	Yeah, I guess so. Thanks.
BUFFY	Hi, sorry to interrupt. We need to see R.J. Brooks down in the guidance office.
TEACHER	Oh. Well, the lesson is just --
BUFFY	It'll just take a moment. I promise I'll have him right back to you.
BUFFY	Yes, there is. There's one of you, and there's one of me. You were the one in math class, tell me what that adds up to.
BUFFY	What's it really like to lead a team? It's gotta be like... being a gladiator, right? Leading warriors into battle.
BUFFY	Oh, I get that! I was, kinda, juggling some stuff in high school too, which was very recent. And it's like everyone expects you to have all this free time for studying! Principal Snyder was always on me.
BUFFY	Oh Snyder was twice the terror that Wood was. Also, half. Short. He was a little short.
BUFFY	Yeah, that would be cool.
BUFFY	Not really. But... I mean, does it bother you?
DAWN	Ugh! I don't even wanna hear his name anymore!
XANDER	I just called him that guy in the jacket.
DAWN	That's what I used to call him in my head before I knew his real name!
DAWN	No . I don't ever want to see her again.
XANDER	I thought this was about the guy in, uh, that guy with the thing.
DAWN	Now it's about both of them.
BUFFY	Xander, hi, this, um, this is R.J. --
XANDER	Listen, you're under a love spell. That's what this has to be. Real love wouldn't make you this irrational. At least, not this fast.
BUFFY	You're right. He's right. You're under a spell. Poor little Dawnie.
WILLOW	But we're working on it. It'll all be better soon, guys. We're zeroing in on this thing.
ANYA	Yes, soon neither one of you will be in love with this boy.
BUFFY	He's not a boy!
DAWN	What do you know about our love?! It's true and real. This isn't magic, this is my heart!
ANYA	Fine.
XANDER	We'll be working.
WILLOW	I know this feels terrible. But it isn't real. Try to hold onto that.
BUFFY	Hear that? This isn't real. You're just crazy.
DAWN	It is so real! I love him! You knew how I felt, like I'd finally found something, and you betrayed me!
BUFFY	I betrayed you? You're the one who's constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover!
DAWN	Your lover?! Your lover !
WILLOW	Guys, guys...
BUFFY	I tried to get you to back away. If you'd listened to me you wouldn't've had to see what you saw!
DAWN	That's right! You lied to me! You lied to me to get me out of the way. "Lay back." "He'll like that."
BUFFY	I was trying to be kind to you, like I always do. Did you want me to tell you that he's in love with me? That your crush is hopeless?
DAWN	It's not a crush! Stop! You're not supposed to do this.
BUFFY	Why? Because he's younger than me? I'm extremely peppy and youthful!
DAWN	No. Because you were the one I trusted.
ANYA	They're crazy little lust-puppies, aren't they?
XANDER	At least the yelling went away. It was starting to sound like Christmas morning with my family.
WILLOW	Love spells. Everyone forgets how dangerous they are.
XANDER	Hey, been there.
WILLOW	Here. Something.
WILLOW	Info on one R.J. Brooks. Buffy hurries over.
BUFFY	Ooh. Lemme see! Is there a picture?
XANDER	Family stuff... Hey, I knew his brother. He was a big jock at Sunnydale High, too. Couple years ahead of us. Used to stick chewing gum in my hair. Huh.
WILLOW	What are you thinking?
XANDER	I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but maybe he's a way in.
BUFFY	Now look for a picture.
XANDER	I'm just saying, we're tangling with a powerful spell here, and we don't know what the deal is, so keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy...
SPIKE	What? You want me to what? Kill Xander? Why? Oh right. The endless prattling.
XANDER	Fine. Just be ready. And don't let this guy charm you either. He had everyone around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.
LANCE	Construction, huh. That's awesome.
XANDER	Yeah.
LANCE	So what's up with R.J.? How's he doin' at the old alpha mater?
XANDER	Good. Just, I know a girl who might be going out with him and I was wondering...
LANCE	Got it. You wanna know if he's a good guy. Truth is, he's the best. Following in my footsteps. (over his shoulder to Spike) You might not know it now, looking at me with a couple extra pounds, but back then I was quite the guy.
XANDER	Yeah, I gather R.J.'s pretty popular too.
LANCE	Gotta tell ya, there was a time I worried about R.J. Used to be all into comic books, model UN, geek stuff. No offense, Harris. And one time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. But then he, whatchacallit... blossomed. That's what it was like.
XANDER	And do you have an idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a--
XANDER	So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?
LANCE	Oh, Dad gave it to me. Made a big deal about it, too, how he met Mom wearing that jacket. She was a former Miss Arkansas. Very hot in her day.
XANDER	Wow, that's wonderful. But it's getting late...
LANCE	Hey, you guys don't have to take off if you don't want to. I've got a sort of rumpus room set up in the basement. There's air hockey and a mini-fridge. We could party.
XANDER	We really gotta go.
WILLOW	Damn love spell. I've tried every anti-love-spell spell I can find.
ANYA	Even if you found the right one, guy would probably just do an anti-anti- love-spell-spell spell.
WILLOW	What?
WILLOW	Buffy isn't here. Go away.
ANYA	No Buffy for you. Leave quickly now.
WILLOW	Man.
ANYA	Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs. If they knew he was here.
WILLOW	But you don't even know him!
ANYA	Yes, I do! I looked into him and I saw his soul!
WILLOW	He was walking away! So unless his soul is in his ass...
ANYA	A.J. is my best friend and dearest darling.
WILLOW	It's R.J. and what you were picking up on was his deep caring and devotion to me.
ANYA	To-- What ?!
DAWN	What's going on?
ANYA	Willow thinks she's in love with my boyfriend R .J.
DAWN	What?! No! You two can't do this!
BUFFY	Willow, you're a gay woman! And he isn't!
WILLOW	This isn't about his physical presence! This is about his heart!
ANYA	But his physical presence has a penis!
WILLOW	I can work around it.
DAWN	This isn't fair! How can you all be doing this to me?
DAWN	It isn't a spell. He owns my heart.
BUFFY	Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out and we don't need you interfering.
DAWN	But he's mine.
BUFFY	Dawnie, sweetie, go to your room, okay? This isn't about you.
WILLOW	There's an easy answer to this. Just think about who loves him most. I clearly do, since I'm, you know, looking past that whole orientation thing...
DAWN	I need him.
ANYA	You gotta do better'n that! I'd kill for him!
WILLOW	You'd kill for a chocolate bar.
BUFFY	No! Yes! Kill for him! I'm a Slayer. Slay means kill. Oh! I can kill the principal!
ANYA	Hmm. That is hard to top.
WILLOW	Yeah? Well, I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.
ANYA	Yeah, right, what are you gonna do, use magic to make him into a girl?
XANDER	Guys! Turns out it really is the jacket and R.J. doesn't even realize what he's got... hello? Hello?
SPIKE	Thought you said they were safe.
XANDER	Where is everybody?
XANDER	Will? Honey? R.J.'s a guy.
WILLOW	Did notice that, yeah. 'S why I'm doing my spell, 'cause, you know... he doesn't have to be.
XANDER	What? You're gonna take off his--
SPIKE	Oh. Hey.
XANDER	Much time before what?
WILLOW	Before Buffy and Anya and Dawn have a chance to prove they love R.J. the most.
XANDER	And how would they do that, exactly?
WILLOW	Well, Buffy's gonna kill principal Wood --
XANDER	Fine! Okay! Let's start there!
BUFFY	What're you guys doing?
WILLOW	Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.
BUFFY	I've got a principal to kill. What's going on? Who are we looking for?
BUFFY	You realize Anya is probably seducing R.J. even as we speak.
WILLOW	Oh, God. You think so?
BUFFY	I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.
WILLOW	Well, so am I, why should I miss out?
XANDER	Hey, crazy women. Look.
BUFFY	What were you -- what is this?
DAWN	It doesn't matter.
DAWN	There's no plan. What am I, gonna compete with you? You're older, and hotter, you have sex that's rough and kill people. I don't have any of that stuff. But if I did this, then, his whole life he'd know that there was someone who loved him so much they'd give up their life.
BUFFY	Oh, Dawn.
DAWN	And it would be true forever. I was giving him my love for forever. It was all I had.
BUFFY	Dawnie... You have so much to offer any guy. I'm just older than you. Marginally. And so, yeah, of course he wants me. But he's not important. You are. No guy is worth your life. Not ever.
DAWN	R.J. is. And don't say he isn't. Look what you were willing to do!
BUFFY	No. He's not worth it. Honey, I'd give him to you in a second if I could, that's how much you're scaring me.
DAWN	But I thought you wanted him. For you.
BUFFY	Nah. Well, yeah. My god, that boy is hot! Sorry. I think I may be under a spell here.
DAWN	I hear you.
XANDER	You're sure you understand the plan?
SPIKE	Yeah. I think I got it.
ANYA	Also, burning cotton-poly blend.
BUFFY	Be honest, Xander. You didn't think about, you know, just slipping that jacket on a little bit?
XANDER	I refuse to answer on the grounds that it didn't fit.
BUFFY	So how did R.J. take the abrupt removal of his mojo?
XANDER	He was pissed, but I don't think he got that the jacket was dosed with magic. Gonna be a rude awakening.
WILLOW	Not as rude as awakening without his parts. I can't believe I almost...
BUFFY	And I can't believe I almost-
ANYA	It was a spell. We were helpless! We aren't responsible for anything we did, morally, or, you know... legally.
XANDER	True. You fell for a mystical, ancient curse. Who here hasn't made that mistake... seven, eight times?
BUFFY	Hear that? Not your fault.
DAWN	I'm just so... The way I acted... The way I talked to you. I feel so stupid. All over a spell.
BUFFY	Get ready to feel even stupider when it's not.
WILLOW	Hey, Anya, you never told us what you "can't believe you almost-"
ANYA	Almost? Who now?
WILLOW	You can't be the only not embarrassed one. What did you do?
ANYA	Oh. I wrote a poem. Epic poem. Comparing him to a daisy and a tower and a lake-

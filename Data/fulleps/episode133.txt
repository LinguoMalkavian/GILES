BUFFY	Try picking on somebody my own size.
RONA	You--You're her.
BUFFY	Her's me.
RONA	I thought... They told me I'd be safe here.
BUFFY	Right. Well... You are. I mean, you will be. Safer. With me around.
RONA	Whoa, whoa, next time? You sayin' I'm gonna get attacked again?
BUFFY	Welcome to the Hellmouth.
KENNEDY	Flooring it. In the bag. 'Cause nice, big, comfy bed right here. I mean, you oughta know. Your bed.
WILLOW	Yeah. No, that's okay. I like it down here. It's... firm.
KENNEDY	Funny, you look a little uncomfortable. Or is it just me?
WILLOW	It's... I'm just a little uneasy with Buffy being out.
KENNEDY	Right. How many girls arriving this time?
WILLOW	Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers-in- waiting to send 'em our way, I expect we'll be seeing more soon enough.
KENNEDY	So... you're saying I should enjoy having this bed to myself as long as I can.
WILLOW	It's starting to get crowded around here. Can't remember the last time I had a bathroom to myself.
KENNEDY	Guess you didn't grow up with any siblings.
WILLOW	Just one and only me. What about you?
KENNEDY	Got a half-sister. Didn't share a bathroom though. Her bedroom was in a different wing of the house.
WILLOW	Wing? Your house... had wings?
KENNEDY	Oh. Yeah. Just a couple. Few. Our summer home in the Hamptons didn't have any at all. Well... one. Actually.
WILLOW	Huh. That's... huh.
KENNEDY	Never mind my deal... What's your story, Willow? I mean, witchcraft... Wow. Sounds... new-agey.
WILLOW	No. Safe to say what I practice is definitely old -agey.
KENNEDY	So... Show me a trick.
WILLOW	A trick?
KENNEDY	Y'know, pull a rabbit outta something. Or make something float.
WILLOW	Yeah, listen, Kennedy... it's almost morning. We really need to get some sleep.
KENNEDY	Hey, if I wanted to sleep, I'd be downstairs catching Z's with the other girls.
MOLLY	Meanwhile, she's the one that goes scampering off. Right into that Turok-Han vampire. Poor Annie.
EVE	Great. So the Slayer who's supposed to protect us let her get killed.
MOLLY	She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish. Buffy can't be faulted for arriving too late.
CHLOE	Not like she could've stopped it. Supervampire messed her up pretty good.
VI	No lie. She still looked like a big bruise when I got here and that was already, like, the day after.
EVE	And why isn't she back yet? Buffy. She left to get the new girl over an hour ago. Maybe she ran into trouble. You don't think maybe she was too late again?
MOLLY	Maybe--
XANDER	Potential Slayers can function without sleep. Me, I'm no good without my usual ninety minutes.
ANDREW	Keep the chatter down. Or... speak up so I can hear you. I'm bored. Episode One bored.
BUFFY	Oh. You're all still up.
XANDER	Who needs sleep?
BUFFY	Everybody, this is Rona.
ANDREW	Hey, Rona.
RONA	Um... Why's that guy tied to a chair?
XANDER	The question you'll soon be asking is why isn't he gagged?
GILES	Molly, take our new houseguest to the kitchen. I'm sure she's hungry after her journey.
RONA	Bit what well?
ANYA	That's English for "hungry."
RONA	Oh. Here I thought "hungry" was English for "hungry."
GILES	Everything all right?
BUFFY	She had a welcoming committee.
XANDER	So The First knows... Potential Slayers are making their way here.
GILES	I'll have to warn the coven to be more cautious.
GILES	I don't know, Buffy. I've exhausted the few resources I have left with little result. The Watchers' records are still really all we have to go on.
ANYA	I made the rounds, myself. Tried to dig up anything useful from the demon community.
XANDER	They're a community now? What's next, a ladies' auxiliary?
ANYA	The few that didn't attack me don't know anything or aren't talking. Either way, we got squat.
BUFFY	Squat's not gonna cut it. What about the Turok-Han?
XANDER	The vampire Time forgot?
BUFFY	Time might've forgotten, but I sure as hell won't. Stakes don't kill it. Anything in the ancient myths about what does? Sunlight? Fire? Germs?
EVE	Spike. Sorry. I'm confused... He's that vampire that's been killing people, right? He's who you're worried about saving?
BUFFY	It's not... You don't know-- It's more complicated than that, Chloe.
CHLOE	I'm Chloe. She's Eve.
EVE	It's just... we've been talking and... well, do we'all have a plan? Any kind of plan... y'know... to keep us from dying?
BUFFY	We're working on it.
GILES	There is one avenue we haven't tried yet... Beljoxa's Eye.
ANYA	Giles...
XANDER	And, exactly, what part of town is that avenue in?
ANYA	I told you, no.
BUFFY	What's a Botoxa's eye?
GILES	Beljoxa. An oracle-like creature. Exists in a dark dimension.
ANYA	An eternal vortex, more like.
BUFFY	Fun.
ANYA	Not really. No.
GILES	The thing is, only demons can open a gateway to it.
ANYA	Excuse me. Ex -demon here.
GILES	Still have friends in the fold. Well, murderous acquaintances, anyway.
ANYA	There's no reason to think the Beljoxa's Eye is going to have the answers we're looking for.
BUFFY	I'll take anything I can get. Anya. Please. We're running out of time. Spike's running out of time.
FIRST	Dreaming of me, again, aren't you? Poor Spike. You really still think I believe in you? Be realistic. I don't even believe in myself. Least not enough to risk my skin to save your ass. Not enough to face that .
SPIKE	Sh-she'll come... for... me.
FIRST	No. I won't.
ANYA	Why not?
GUY	You got the nerve to ask me that?
ANYA	C'mon, Torg, that was a lifetime ago.
TORG	Three . But who's counting? You broke my heart, Anyanka.
ANYA	Don't be so dramatic, Torg. You don't even have a heart. Six spleens. Two stomachs. Half a brain, maybe, but no heart.
TORG	Don't mock this. That night we shared was important to me.
ANYA	It was one date. Wasn't even a date. We just happened to be invited to the same massacre... And you hit on me after I'd had a few.
TORG	I remember. You wore pink.
ANYA	Those were entrails--
GILES	I'm sorry. Could we possibly skip the recriminations of past--
ANYA	Okay, Torg. Look... Just open this one little gateway to the Beljoxa's Eye for me and... And I'll... You and I... can... go to... I'll have sex with you again.
TORG	Uch, please. You're human. The way you look now... Wouldn't touch you for all the kittens in Korea.
ANYA	You-- You're rejecting my offer of sexual bribery?! Not that I wanted to sleep with you, but what am I, a leper in this town?! I can't even give it away!
TORG	Come back when you're a leper.
GILES	Perhaps this might persuade you... Help us and the Slayer won't kill all your clientele and burn your establishment to the ground.
TORG	Ek'vola mok't Beljoxa do'kar.
ANYA	It's my hair, right? Not attractive.
GILES	C'mon.
ANYA	Buckle up.
ANYA	God! I hate this place!
GILES	Where's the Beljoxa's Eye?!
EYE	Here.
ANYA	Oh, hi!
WILLOW	Hello?... No, Giles isn't here right-- Yeah, this is Willow... Althenea, hi! How's the coven? I miss you guys. Still working out that Pleiadian spirit conjuring-- What? Oh... Okay... When?
ANDREW	Ow! Watch it. That's my joystick hand.
XANDER	Not touchin' that one.
BUFFY	Okay, listen up, Andrew. I don't exactly know what to do with you just yet. Except that we don't have time to babysit a hostage.
XANDER	Especially a hostage that's gotten more than a little ripe.
BUFFY	But I'm here to tell you... If you try anything or try to run, I'll... Did you see the movie "Misery?"
ANDREW	Six times. But the book was scarier 'cause instead of crushing his foot with a sledgehammer, Kathy Bates chopped it off with--
WILLOW	Word from the underground. Another Potential arrived in town the day before yesterday. She's at the Sunspot Motel, near the highway.
XANDER	Day before yesterday? Why are we just finding out about it now?
WILLOW	Bringers killed her Watcher before he could tell anyone he sent her. If it wasn't for a particularly powerful seer in the coven, we wouldn't even know about it now.
BUFFY	Okay. Still a couple of hours of daylight left. You guys should be safe. I'll go get her.
XANDER	I'll go with you.
ANDREW	Let's do it.
DAWN	Where they going?
WILLOW	Bringing another newbie in from the cold.
DAWN	Another one?
WILLOW	The more the better, I figure. We need all the help we can get.
DAWN	Help, sure. That's cool, but...
WILLOW	What?
DAWN	Just not sure more scared, Slayer wannabes translates as better.
EVE	What are we'all doing here?
KENNEDY	It's called "training." Didn't your Watcher ever teach you the word?
RONA	I never had a Watcher. Only just found out what I was... or what I might be... after those crazy-ass monks came after me.
EVE	I meant why are we bothering? It's not like we can make a difference.
MOLLY	Got to train. Keep our reflexes-- (drops the stake) sharp.
KENNEDY	We have to be ready. If something comes down--
CHLOE	Something's already come down.
EVE	She's right. And what are we supposed to do about it? I mean... I've never even seen a real vampire in my life, much less slayed one.
VI	I've seen one. Well... My Watcher once showed me a photograph of one. A blurry photograph.
EVE	That's what I'm sayin'. Not one of us is remotely prepared to be activated as the new Chosen one.
KENNEDY	I feel pretty prepared.
RONA	Excuse the newness of me, but, just so I understand... If Buffy dies...
EVE	Well, when Buffy dies... I mean, nobody lives forever, right?
RONA	One of us...
EVE	Gets activated, uh huh.
MOLLY	I prefer "called."
EVE	Whatever. You become the Slayer. With the weight of the world on your shoulders. The future of the whole human race in your hands.
CHLOE	It won't be me. I mean, not now. I mean... I'm too young.
KENNEDY	Doesn't work that way. In fact, the younger the better. In fact... I'm starting to think it might be too late for me.
EVE	Never too late. Could be anyone. Especially since there's so few of us left. They'll just run through each of us... One after the other...
XANDER	We sure this is it?
BUFFY	Clerk said this is the only check-in they've had in a week. Tourism must be down.
XANDER	And right in the middle of Apocalypse season.
BUFFY	Hello...?
XANDER	Break the door down.
BUFFY	She's cold. Been dead for days.
XANDER	Poor kid. Made it all the way to Sunnydale. Just to get herself killed. If only we'd--
EVE	Just my personal opinion, but...
WILLOW	Buffy!?
DAWN	What is it--?
KENNEDY	Who... get away from who?
EVE	What's the problem, officer?
BUFFY	I said, get away from them. Now!
DAWN	Buffy, what did Eve do?
XANDER	That's not Eve.
BUFFY	Eve's dead.
RONA	I... I don't understand...
FIRST	Oops. One more down. Oh, well. Can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? Thanks for the slumber party, girls. It's been real fun these past coupla nights. Learned a whole--
BUFFY	Shut up and get out.
FIRST	Or you'll do what?
ANDREW	I... need to go wash up again.
GILES	I refuse to believe that! There has to be some way to destroy it!
ANYA	Okay, we tried. Let's go, Giles.
GILES	You're saying The First will succeed in wiping out the line of Slayers!
ANYA	Yes! We all have that! It's called memory! Can you help us with something a little more... demony?
GILES	If The First has been around for all time... why hasn't it attempted something like this before?! Why now?!
GILES	Opportunity?!
ANYA	Why? Something The First did?!
GILES	Then what caused the disruption?! What is responsible for letting this happen?!
VI	We should run--
KENNEDY	And go where?
DAWN	Annabelle ran. Look what it got her--
BUFFY	It's safer in than out.
MOLLY	How can you say that? It was here, Buffy. In the house. Living with us for days--
CHLOE	And you didn't even know it--
XANDER	None of us knew it--
VI	It could still be here. It could be any one of us--
WILLOW	No. The First can only take the form of dead people--
RONA	Yeah, well, there'll be plenty more of those soon enough.
BUFFY	Hey!
ANDREW	She's right! Where would the Justice League be if they hadn't put aside their differences to stop the Imperium and his shapeshifting alien horde?
BUFFY	Don't help me.
XANDER	Buff... Sun goes down, Ubervamp's on its way. So, plan'd be nice about now.
BUFFY	Will... Sorry, but I gotta ask...
WILLOW	I know. We need a barrier.
BUFFY	A major one. Something tells me this vamp doesn't need an invite to get in the house. Can you do it?
WILLOW	I'll try.
RONA	Try?
KENNEDY	You heard her.
XANDER	You sure about Willow doing the hocus pocus again, Buff? I mean, last time--
BUFFY	We don't have a lot of choices, Xander.
CHLOE	And what if it doesn't work? What if that monster gets through?
BUFFY	Then we'll deal with it.
RONA	Deal? Fight, you mean... How we supposed to do that?
VI	And with what?
KENNEDY	With whatever it takes. Right?
MOLLY	Buffy... You fought the Turok-Han. And it almost killed you--
CHLOE	And you're the real Slayer.
RONA	What chance do we have?
MOLLY	Honestly. You staked that thing and it didn't die.
DAWN	No, but that doesn't-
VI	Maybe it can't be killed.
DAWN	That mean we shouldn't try?
RONA	There's that word again.
KENNEDY	Hey, it's a good word. I like that word. Means not giving up.
XANDER	What?
KENNEDY	I said... Trying is good.
XANDER	I just thought it bared repeating.
FIRST	...For all good children to say, "good night."
FIRST	I just love having you all to myself.
DAWN	There's more of them now.
XANDER	And two others out back.
MOLLY	Why aren't they doing anything? Attacking?
BUFFY	They don't want in. They're here to make sure we don't get out.
RONA	Like this'll do any good. I mean, what's the point?
KENNEDY	It's this end, right here. Stick that in the bad guys. Any more questions?
BUFFY	Know how to use that?
KENNEDY	Since I was eight.
ANDREW	Can I have something?
WILLOW	Facing my fear... I'm facing my fear... Hear that, fear? I'm facing you...
KENNEDY	Wow...
WILLOW	Just testing.
KENNEDY	Oh. Right. Heard this voodoo once turned you into the big, scary. Big, scary Willow... That's something I'd almost like to see some--
WILLOW	No. You wouldn't.
KENNEDY	Said "almost."
WILLOW	Last time I tried a spell... The First... it... had me. Got inside. I felt it. In every fiber of my being. Pure, undiluted evil. I could taste it.
KENNEDY	How's Evil taste?
WILLOW	A little chalky.
DAWN	Something's happening...
RONA	Oh, my god.
BUFFY	Here it comes.
WILLOW	Caerimonia Minerva, saepio saepire saepsi...
ANDREW	Um... Deflector shields... Deflector shields up!
BUFFY	Willow--?
WILLOW	...Saepio impedimentum!
CHLOE	It's working!
VI	For the moment.
BUFFY	Will?
WILLOW	It's-- It's... strong.
KENNEDY	It's hurting her.
BUFFY	Hang on, Will.
WILLOW	I... don't know--
DAWN	She can't hold it.
RONA	What do we do? What do we do?!
BUFFY	Run. Everybody! Run!
BUFFY	C'mon.
GILES	Are you all ri--?
ANYA	I just... still don't understand how Buffy's death mucked up the Slayer mojo. Not like she hasn't died before.
GILES	It's not her dying. The Beljoxa's Eye was clear... in its enigmatic way... It's because she lives. Again. Buffy's not responsible for that.
ANYA	NO. It's our fault. Willow and me and Xander and... and Tara. We brought her back... We're the reason The First is here. The reason all those girls were murdered--
GILES	Anya--
ANYA	So the whole world would've been better off if Buffy had stayed dead?!
XANDER	No Bringers following. Guess they're leaving us for old snaggletooth.
WILLOW	Where is the Turok-Han?
BUFFY	Right behind us. Time to split up.
MOLLY	Split up?... We're splitting up? Is that wise?
BUFFY	You take the others... find a safe location.
XANDER	I know a place.
DAWN	What are you going to do?
BUFFY	Try to slow the Turok down. Lead him away from you guys. Get him to chase me.
DAWN	Buffy, you can't take that thing on yourself.
KENNEDY	I'll stay.
BUFFY	No --
ANDREW	Hey! I need that!
BUFFY	Willow, you and Xander, get everybody out of here... Now!
WILLOW	C'mon...
XANDER	Hafta go, Dawnie.
MOLLY	Where are we?
XANDER	Future site of the new Public Library. Opening May, 2003 If I ever get back to work.
RONA	This what you call a safe location?
VI	It's the middle of nothing.
WILLOW	It'll do. Everybody, spread out. Take positions...
ANDREW	Um... What's my position?
WILLOW	And don't make a sound.
RONA	That's the plan?! Spread out?!
DAWN	Xander...?
RONA	That thing is gonna kill Buffy, then come for us. For all we know, it's killing her right now.
KENNEDY	Or it could just skip that part and come straight here.
CHLOE	Oh, god... Oh, no.. no no no...
DAWN	Buffy?
MOLLY	What's she doing?
WILLOW	Just watch...
BUFFY	Think you've won, don't you? Got us trapped... Now you're all pumped up, ready for the slaughter. You and your boss, The First.
I	don't know whether I can beat you or not, but whatever happens, we finish it here. And now.
ANDREW	Two men enter, one man leaves.
DAWN	This... You planned this. Letting the barrier fail. Bringing us here. You and Buffy...
XANDER	What?
KENNEDY	I said... Trying is good.
XANDER	I just thought it bared repeating.
RONA	It's killing her.
MOLLY	We... We have to do something.
WILLOW	Wait.
BUFFY	See...
SPIKE	A... knife, now, is it?... What.. What'll that--? Y-you can't... hurt me. You're just... just a bloody figment, you are. Just a--
RONA	You--You're her.
BUFFY	Her's me.
RONA	I thought... They told me I'd be safe here.
BUFFY	Right. Well... You are. I mean, you will be. Safer. With me around.
RONA	Whoa, whoa, next time? You sayin' I'm gonna get attacked again?
KENNEDY	Flooring it. In the bag. 'Cause nice, big, comfy bed right here. I mean, you oughta know. Your bed.
WILLOW	Yeah. No, that's okay. I like it down here. It's... firm.
KENNEDY	Funny, you look a little uncomfortable. Or is it just me?

CHLOE	It won't be me. I mean, not now. I mean... I'm too young.
KENNEDY	Doesn't work that way. In fact, the younger the better. In fact... I'm starting to think it might be too late for me.
EVE	Never too late. Could be anyone. Especially since there's so few of us left. They'll just run through each of us... One after the other...
XANDER	We sure this is it?
BUFFY	Clerk said this is the only check-in they've had in a week. Tourism must be down.
XANDER	And right in the middle of Apocalypse season.
DAWN	Buffy, what did Eve do?
XANDER	That's not Eve.
BUFFY	Eve's dead.
FIRST	Oops. One more down. Oh, well. Can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? Thanks for the slumber party, girls. It's been real fun these past coupla nights. Learned a whole--
BUFFY	Shut up and get out.
GILES	I refuse to believe that! There has to be some way to destroy it!
ANYA	Okay, we tried. Let's go, Giles.
GILES	You're saying The First will succeed in wiping out the line of Slayers!
ANYA	Yes! We all have that! It's called memory! Can you help us with something a little more... demony?
GILES	If The First has been around for all time... why hasn't it attempted something like this before?! Why now?!
GILES	Opportunity?!
ANYA	Why? Something The First did?!
GILES	Then what caused the disruption?! What is responsible for letting this happen?!
VI	We should run--
KENNEDY	And go where?
DAWN	Annabelle ran. Look what it got her--
BUFFY	It's safer in than out.
MOLLY	How can you say that? It was here, Buffy. In the house. Living with us for days--
CHLOE	And you didn't even know it--
XANDER	None of us knew it--
VI	It could still be here. It could be any one of us--
WILLOW	No. The First can only take the form of dead people--
RONA	Yeah, well, there'll be plenty more of those soon enough.
ANDREW	She's right! Where would the Justice League be if they hadn't put aside their differences to stop the Imperium and his shapeshifting alien horde?
BUFFY	Will... Sorry, but I gotta ask...
WILLOW	I know. We need a barrier.
BUFFY	A major one. Something tells me this vamp doesn't need an invite to get in the house. Can you do it?
WILLOW	I'll try.
RONA	Try?
KENNEDY	You heard her.
XANDER	You sure about Willow doing the hocus pocus again, Buff? I mean, last time--
BUFFY	We don't have a lot of choices, Xander.
CHLOE	And what if it doesn't work? What if that monster gets through?
BUFFY	Then we'll deal with it.
RONA	Deal? Fight, you mean... How we supposed to do that?
VI	And with what?
KENNEDY	With whatever it takes. Right?
MOLLY	Buffy... You fought the Turok-Han. And it almost killed you--
CHLOE	And you're the real Slayer.
RONA	What chance do we have?
MOLLY	Honestly. You staked that thing and it didn't die.
DAWN	No, but that doesn't-
VI	Maybe it can't be killed.
DAWN	That mean we shouldn't try?
RONA	There's that word again.
KENNEDY	Hey, it's a good word. I like that word. Means not giving up.
XANDER	What?
KENNEDY	I said... Trying is good.
XANDER	I just thought it bared repeating.
XANDER	And two others out back.
MOLLY	Why aren't they doing anything? Attacking?
BUFFY	Know how to use that?
WILLOW	Just testing.
KENNEDY	Oh. Right. Heard this voodoo once turned you into the big, scary. Big, scary Willow... That's something I'd almost like to see some--
KENNEDY	Said "almost."
WILLOW	Last time I tried a spell... The First... it... had me. Got inside. I felt it. In every fiber of my being. Pure, undiluted evil. I could taste it.
KENNEDY	How's Evil taste?
WILLOW	A little chalky.
WILLOW	Caerimonia Minerva, saepio saepire saepsi...
ANDREW	Um... Deflector shields... Deflector shields up!
BUFFY	Willow--?
CHLOE	It's working!
VI	For the moment.
KENNEDY	It's hurting her.
BUFFY	Hang on, Will.
WILLOW	I... don't know--
DAWN	She can't hold it.
RONA	What do we do? What do we do?!
GILES	Are you all ri--?
ANYA	I just... still don't understand how Buffy's death mucked up the Slayer mojo. Not like she hasn't died before.
GILES	It's not her dying. The Beljoxa's Eye was clear... in its enigmatic way... It's because she lives. Again. Buffy's not responsible for that.
ANYA	NO. It's our fault. Willow and me and Xander and... and Tara. We brought her back... We're the reason The First is here. The reason all those girls were murdered--
GILES	Anya--
ANYA	So the whole world would've been better off if Buffy had stayed dead?!
XANDER	No Bringers following. Guess they're leaving us for old snaggletooth.
WILLOW	Where is the Turok-Han?
BUFFY	Right behind us. Time to split up.
MOLLY	Split up?... We're splitting up? Is that wise?
BUFFY	You take the others... find a safe location.
XANDER	I know a place.
DAWN	What are you going to do?
BUFFY	Try to slow the Turok down. Lead him away from you guys. Get him to chase me.
DAWN	Buffy, you can't take that thing on yourself.
KENNEDY	I'll stay.
BUFFY	No --
ANDREW	Hey! I need that!
BUFFY	Willow, you and Xander, get everybody out of here... Now!
MOLLY	Where are we?
XANDER	Future site of the new Public Library. Opening May, 2003 If I ever get back to work.
RONA	This what you call a safe location?
VI	It's the middle of nothing.
WILLOW	It'll do. Everybody, spread out. Take positions...
ANDREW	Um... What's my position?
WILLOW	And don't make a sound.
RONA	That's the plan?! Spread out?!
DAWN	Xander...?
RONA	That thing is gonna kill Buffy, then come for us. For all we know, it's killing her right now.
DAWN	Buffy?
MOLLY	What's she doing?
XANDER	What?
KENNEDY	I said... Trying is good.
XANDER	I just thought it bared repeating.
RONA	It's killing her.
MOLLY	We... We have to do something.
WILLOW	Wait.

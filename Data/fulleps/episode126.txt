XANDER	Hey!
BUFFY	Sorry.
DAWN	I think that thing had a child-lock. I'm all cricky. You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I was in the kid coffin for--
XANDER	Thirty-three minutes. Since when did we go to all this effort for one lousy vampire, make that one lousy potential vampire?
BUFFY	Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how. Look, I know it's my job and not yours--
XANDER	No, no, I'm sorry. I want to help. I guess I'm a bit stressed out these days. Sorry to take it out on you.
BUFFY	No big. I'm kinda stressed myself.
DAWN	Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying. She's here. But not here, "part of the gang" here. And hopefully not here, "under my feet 'cause she's in another time- dimension" here.
BUFFY	There's Willow, there's the looming humongo bad, and.. it's a school night. I should be home in bed, cuddling up to my insomnia and worrying how I'm going to mess up tomorrow.
DAWN	You'll do fine. You'll be a great counselor.
BUFFY	But this week is going to be my first time really talking to kids. What if their problems are all weird and tricky? What if I can't help them?
XANDER	I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. You're perfect for this job.
BUFFY	Yeah, right. Check out perfect me taking my sister on a fun, educational outing to the--
DAWN	Dead body.
XANDER	I dunno, amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean, like natural causes dead.
BUFFY	The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
XANDER	Maybe she cut herself shaving. And then died, naturally, of embarrassment.
WOMAN	I. Am. Not. Peaceful.
BUFFY	That I can help with.
AMANDA	Hello?
BUFFY	Come in!
AMANDA	Mr. Miller sent me here.
BUFFY	Do you know why?
AMANDA	I'm not sure. Maybe 'cause this guy was picking on me.
MATTHEW	I don't want to say I was popular or whatever, but you know, people liked me. It sucks being new.
BUFFY	But this is a new school. Everyone here is new.
MATTHEW	Yeah, but lots of them know each other from before. I don't have anywhere to sit at lunch. It's stupid. I don't know why I came here--
BUFFY	It's not stupid. It's like the teacher's lounge for me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do in there. I mean, lounge of course, but it's weird. I feel awkward, just like you do.
MATTHEW	So, what you're saying is, it doesn't get any better?
TOMAS	I don't want to talk to you, okay?
BUFFY	Okay. That's fine.
TOMAS	I'm serious! I'm not talking to you!
BUFFY	Okay.
AMANDA	He said all sorts of things. Stuff about how my clothes are all cheap and I look like a blue-light special.
BUFFY	I'm sorry Amanda.
AMANDA	And then my mom had to go and call him at his house. Telling him that he shouldn't make fun of me, just 'cause she's not rich and she's a single mom and all that. I don't need him knowing my life story.
BUFFY	It's awful being teased. But the thing is, bullies like that? They're just--
AMANDA	Insecure?
MATTHEW	So what am I supposed to do, stick a sign on my back that says, "Befriend me?"
BUFFY	Nothing so drastic. Just tomorrow at lunch, you look for someone who's sitting alone. And you sit down next to them.
MATTHEW	Yeah? I don't know.
BUFFY	You could picture them in their underwear, but it might ruin your appetite.
MATTHEW	Yeah, maybe.
BUFFY	You've got to stick up for yourself. Let this bully know that you won't take any sh--guff, from him. Any guff.
AMANDA	I'm glad you said that.
BUFFY	Well, it's true.
AMANDA	Well, 'cause that's what I did. stood up for myself. The other day after class? I jumped him in the parking lot and slammed his stupid-ass insecure face right into the pavement.
BUFFY	You, what ?
AMANDA	I guess that's the other reason Mr. Miller wanted me to see you. I'm glad someone understands me. Do you think I should pound on him some more?
XANDER	I bet she's giving them great advice.
WILLOW	Absolutely. Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just wish she believed it. She's stressing over the whole "college- drop-out-not-actually-qualified" thing. Plus, knowing there's a salivating hellmouth right under their feet... and the whole...
XANDER	"From beneath you it devours."
WILLOW	I know. It's going to be bad. Real bad. And I wonder, will I... If it comes, when it comes, will I be able to help?
XANDER	I think you will.
WILLOW	I don't know. I don't know what I can do. And frankly, I'm scared of what I might do.
XANDER	I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail.
WILLOW	Right. Ouch.
XANDER	So you choke up, then you have control, but no power. It could take ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control; it's a trade-off.
WILLOW	That's actually not a bad analogy. Except, I'm less worried about hitting my thumb and more worried about going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' skulls open like coconuts.
XANDER	Right. Ouch.
WILLOW	Sorry. I don't know, Xander. Being back here? I'm not sure I'm ready.
XANDER	You are, I mean it'll take time.
WILLOW	Hey.
TOMAS	I'm scared.
NICHOLS	I hate to miss Bio., but I thought it was best that I come talk to you.
BUFFY	So, what's on your mind?
NICHOLS	On my mind?
BUFFY	Are you worried about school, friends, girls, your parents--
NICHOLS	Yeah, that's it. My parents.
BUFFY	What about them?
NICHOLS	Um... issues of divorce.
BUFFY	Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.
NICHOLS	Mine are still happily married. It's hard. I feel left out. And...uh, I'm also concerned about... girls!
BUFFY	Yeah.
TOMAS	My brother's joining up with the Marines.
BUFFY	He sounds like he's pretty tough, your brother.
TOMAS	Yeah. He's, you know, a man. And I'm just, messed up.
BUFFY	You're not messed up. It's not messed up to worry about your brother.
TOMAS	Yeah. I mean, what if he... doesn't come back? What if he gets blown up? I can't sleep 'cause of this.
BUFFY	Have you talked to your brother? Told him how you feel?
TOMAS	Nah. I don't want to. I don't want to talk to him, okay?
BUFFY	Okay.
TOMAS	I'm not going to talk to him!
BUFFY	So, Josh, what's on your mind?
JOSH	Um, I'm worried that I'm gay.
BUFFY	Okay, first of all, I think it's great that you would talk to me about this. And you should know there's nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.
JOSH	I know. It's just, I'm not positive. So I was thinking, why don't you go out on a date with me and I can find out for sure?
BUFFY	It sounds like it's difficult for you. Like maybe your sister makes it hard for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, and that she doesn't let you make your own decisions--
DAWN	Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.
BUFFY	I understand. That must be hard.
ANYA	It is hard. I know, it is. But, honestly? I bet you'll feel better if you talk about it. A lot better.
LULU	You don't mind?
ANYA	Talk to me.
LULU	I just. I just can't believe he forgot. We've been going out for six years and he forgot my birthday.
ANYA	Ucch. And he didn't do anything? No flowers, no card, no dinner at an extravagantly over-priced restaurant?
LULU	Nothing. And all day long, I kept thinking he was about to surprise me... And I guess he did 'cause - Surprise! - He forgot.
ANYA	What a creepazoid. It's like he didn't just forget your birthday, but the day on which, in keeping with modern American tradition, one's life is celebrated. One's very self. (then; dire) He didn't celebrate your self.
LULU	He didn't, did he?
ANYA	You know what? I think you deserve vengeance.
LULU	Vengeance.
ANYA	How old are you?
LULU	What? I'm... thirty. Why?
ANYA	Just wishful thinking... But imagine if he was forced, for thirt--
LULU	Please don't say that... number. I can't bear to think about it.
ANYA	Did he know this? That you're freaked about being--
LULU	Older? Maybe, yeah. I mean, I did tell him I didn't want to make a big deal about it.
ANYA	No big deal. Like no cake, no party, no presents, no big deal?
LULU	I may have said something like that. But I didn't say no card ! I wouldn't have minded a card. As long as it had no specifics, you know, no mention that I'm...
ANYA	Thirty isn't old. Believe me. But anyway, this boyfriend of yours - it sounds like maybe he was just trying to do what you wanted.
LULU	Yeah. But it wasn't what I wanted. It was what I said I wanted but, I guess it wasn't what I really wanted.
ANYA	But he tried. I mean, he tried to respect your wishes.
LULU	Yeah, he did. It's kind of sweet if you think about it. But now I'm sad I didn't have a party.
ANYA	It's not too late. You could just celebrate being twenty-nine again.
LULU	I could do that. Yeah. Maybe I could get a piñata.
ANYA	Knock yourself out.
LULU	Thanks, you've been a big help.
ANYA	Wait...
BUFFY	So you're not doing your homework.
CASSIE	I guess not. It all seems kind of, whatever.
BUFFY	I know high school can be frustrating. But if you just get through it, then you can go to college or join the French Foreign Legion or anything you want.
CASSIE	Yeah. Well, I'm not going to do all that stuff.
BUFFY	Okay, so no French Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean, all the changing your name and being indentured for years and occupying Algeria.
CASSIE	It's just, I'm not graduating from high school.
BUFFY	Why not?
CASSIE	I like that shirt. Where did you--
BUFFY	Don't change the subject, Cassie why wouldn't you graduate?
CASSIE	Because next Friday I'm gonna die.
BUFFY	What?
CASSIE	Can we talk, about something else?
BUFFY	No. We have to talk about this.
CASSIE	Just, never mind...
BUFFY	Cassie, what makes you feel like this?
CASSIE	Feel like what?
BUFFY	Like you want to... hurt yourself.
CASSIE	I'm not going to commit suicide, if that's what you're saying. No way.
BUFFY	Okay. Then, what, what are you saying?
CASSIE	Look, I don't mean to be a pain, you seem really nice, and I know you just want to help, but I'm just wasting your time.
BUFFY	No, you're not. This is why I'm here. Tell me why you think you're going to die.
CASSIE	I don't think it; I know it. I just, know .
BUFFY	What do you mean, you know? Are you saying you know someone wants to hurt you? Has someone threatened you?
CASSIE	No. I just know next Friday I'm going to die. Some things, I just know. I don't know how I do, I just do. Like, I know there's gonna be coins.
BUFFY	Coins?
CASSIE	Lots of coins. Weird ones. And I know you'll go someplace, dark... underground. I don't know...
BUFFY	What do you mean, underground?
CASSIE	And I know you'll try to help.
BUFFY	Cassie, I don't understand what you're--
CASSIE	But you can't, okay?
BUFFY	I--
CASSIE	Thanks for being nice. And I really do like that shirt. The color's good for you. You should put on a sweater so it doesn't get stained.
BUFFY	Cassie, wait--
CASSIE	I gotta go.
BUFFY	What am I supposed to do?
WOOD	You did what you were supposed to. You reported the situation to me.
BUFFY	And?
WOOD	And...
BUFFY	The hood?
WOOD	Beverly Hills. Which is a hood. (off her discomfort) The point is - I was talking big because I was scared. I couldn't bust a move in high school, let alone an ass. Most of the time that's what it is when students act out. Fear, pain...
BUFFY	But sometimes, sometimes it's not just talk, right?
WOOD	One in a hundred, maybe two hundred, they're for real.
BUFFY	So what do we do? How do we help her?
WOOD	Every time there's a threat like this, we do the same dance.
BUFFY	It's not enough. I want to, I don't know what. I need to do something. I need to make this better.
BUFFY	I have a job for you.
MIKE	What're you drawing?
CASSIE	Don't you have a history test to study for?
MIKE	Why don't you design a tattoo for me?
CASSIE	A tattoo? Yeah, right. I can just picture that.
MIKE	C'mon, design something and we can get matching tattoos. Maybe like a snake with some fire coming out of it's mouth.
CASSIE	Or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when you flex?
MIKE	Now you're talking. Like a sexy hula girl, but a sexy snake hula girl.
CASSIE	You're so ridiculous.
MIKE	So... I was kind of thinking maybe we should go to that dance after all.
CASSIE	What do you mean "after all"? I told you I don't want to go.
MIKE	I assumed you were kidding.
CASSIE	It'd probably just be lame anyway.
MIKE	Yeah, but lame is funny. And maybe fun. If we're, you know, hanging out together.
CASSIE	We hang out all the time.
MIKE	Right. And therefore, we should hang out at the Winter Formal.
DAWN	Hey.
CASSIE	Right. Hey, Dawn. I like your ashtray work.
DAWN	Thanks. They can also be used as jewelry holders.
CASSIE	That's the genius. There was an assignment but I didn't write it down. Something to do with glazes -
MIKE	As scintillating as this pottery talk is, I'd better go and actually study. I'm Mike, by the way. Cassie talks about your ashtrays all the time.
DAWN	Hi. Sorry. I didn't mean to-
MIKE	Don't worry about it. I gotta hit the books if I'm going to ace this test like it deserves to be aced. It was nice meeting you though. Cass, I'll see you later?
CASSIE	Hey Mike! You're going to get a B.
MIKE	A-plus baby, A-plus.
DAWN	Is that any good?
CASSIE	Yeah, actually, yeah.
DAWN	What do you have to read it for?
CASSIE	Oh, just for me I guess. I've pretty much stopped reading my school assignments. I just read what I want.
DAWN	That's so cool. I'd do that, but my sister would be down my neck in a second.
CASSIE	Summers. Hey, is your sister Ms. Summers the counselor?
DAWN	Yeah, lucky me, huh?
CASSIE	Nah, she's nice. I saw her this morning actually.
DAWN	Oh yeah? What about?
CASSIE	Oh, I don't care.
DAWN	So. Mike's a cutie. Are you guys going to that dance?
CASSIE	I don't think so.
DAWN	Oh, I...I mean, didn't he ask you?
CASSIE	Only like a hundred and five times.
DAWN	You said no?
CASSIE	A hundred and six times. I, I can't go. I'm not going to be around that night.
BUFFY	Cassie's records all show the same story - Good grades, good kid. Then suddenly, not so good grades, absenteeism, comments about apathy and depression.
XANDER	So, the question is, what changed?
BUFFY	Right. If she did have some kind of psychic vision, that would explain it. I mean, it's hard to do homework if you think you're about to die.
WILLOW	You really think this girl is some kind of precog?
BUFFY	I don't know. Maybe. I told you how she--
XANDER	Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. I'm not saying you don't have Slayer Grace? But it's not the first time.
WILLOW	Maybe, just maybe, you're trying so hard to help, that you're seeing paranormal where there's just normal. Depressed normal, but normal.
BUFFY	Maybe. But, maybe not.
WILLOW	Want me to check medical records?
BUFFY	Her doctor already sent them.
XANDER	Strep throat, ear infections, yeast infection, none of my business. No real info here.
BUFFY	We got zip. And we're running out of days.
WILLOW	Have you Googled her?
XANDER	Willow! She's seventeen!
WILLOW	It's a search engine. Look.
XANDER	A day and a half of researching and we finally try looking up her .
BUFFY	Wow. Lotta poems here.
XANDER	Poems. Always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
WILLOW	The sheets above me cool my skin/ like dirt on a mad woman's grave/
XANDER	Okay... Death really is on her brain.
DAWN	We all deal with death...
XANDER	But this girl isn't just dealing. She's giving death a long sloppy word kiss. She has a yen for the big dirt nap.
WILLOW	I don't know. A lot of teenagers post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. I even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day.
XANDER	Love poems?
WILLOW	I'm over you now, Sweetie.
XANDER	Love poems.
WILLOW	Look, all I'm saying is this is normal teen stuff, You join chat rooms, you write poems, you post Doogie Howser fan fic. It's normal. Right? Let's see if there're any other sites.
DAWN	You guys are way off track. I got a hunch on this one.
WILLOW	I think we've seen most of this. Here's something, oh no, it's " Phillip Newton."
BUFFY	That's her dad. Open that.
DAWN	I'm telling you I got this case cracked wide open. I got the suspect fingered. I told you about Mike Warburton, right?
BUFFY	The one who asked her to the dance?
DAWN	Right. The one who keeps asking her to the dance. I'm thinking, who likes to be rejected? Nobody. I'm thinking, some people can't handle rejection. I'm thinking--
WILLOW	I got something here!
BUFFY	Her dad's a drunk.
XANDER	A violent drunk?
BUFFY	We better find out. Here's his address. Xand, you got your keys?
DAWN	You guys! Listen up. I'm telling you, I'm liking Mike Warburton for the perp. Let's collar him before he lawyers up!
BUFFY	Buffy the Vampire Slayer would just kick down this door.
XANDER	And Buffy the counselor?
BUFFY	Waits.
NEWTON	That's right.
BUFFY	I work at your daughter's school. I need to talk to you.
NEWTON	Is she screwing up her grades again? She's not the sharpest apple in the barrel.
BUFFY	She's having some problems. But it's kind of you I want to talk about.
NEWTON	What about?
BUFFY	I know you got picked up by the police a couple times. Are you still drinking a lot?
NEWTON	What's that got to do with Cassie?
XANDER	You tell us.
NEWTON	What's this, "You tell us"? Who do you two think you are, McMillan and Wife?
XANDER	He looked at me. He just said "wife" and looked at me.
BUFFY	Xander. Mr. Newton, I don't know exactly how to ask this...
NEWTON	Ask what? Look, I let you into my house, but I'm tired and I got things to do.
XANDER	Yeah, you look real busy--
BUFFY	Frankly, we're worried that you might drink too much and hurt Cassie.
NEWTON	Oh, I see. That's all, You come in here in the middle of the night, into my home, and start accusing me of beating on my daughter? That's all ?
BUFFY	We just want to make sure--
NEWTON	Well, that's a lie. Who told you-- Did Cassie's mother put you up to this? 'Cause I pay my support, okay? To the dime. She just wants to take away the one weekend a month I get to see my girl.
BUFFY	Which is when?
NEWTON	What?
BUFFY	Which weekend is it?
NEWTON	I just had her. Last weekend. Look, I may not be the greatest dad in the world. But I don't beat up my girl. I don't-
BUFFY	Will you see her this Friday?
NEWTON	Not unless my ex-wife gets a personality transplant.
BUFFY	Okay.
NEWTON	Okay, what? Okay, now you'll yet out of my house?
BUFFY	Yeah. Yeah, we will.
NEWTON	Is that a threat?
BUFFY	Shouldn't it be a comfort?
CASSIE	It's not him. He's not the one who does it. (to Buffy) Thank you for trying. But I probably shouldn't have told you anything. You're making such a big deal and I want it all to just...go away.
XANDER	Are you talking about... killing yourself?
CASSIE	No! Of course not.
BUFFY	Then fight. Try.
CASSIE	There's no point. I told you-
BUFFY	See, that doesn't sound like someone who really wants to live.
CASSIE	How can you say that? You think I want this? That I don't care?
I	don't know... fall in love.
BUFFY	Cassie, no. You will. You will. You just have to tell us what you know. Everything about this... Please, please, help us.
CASSIE	I can't. I just know. It's going to happen. I don't know why and I don't know how. But something out there is going to kill me.
WOOD	Hey, how we doing?
BUFFY	Oh!
WOOD	Sorry, didn't mean to...
BUFFY	It's okay. I just didn't sleep much.
WOQD	It's been a long week, huh?
BUFFY	I sit alone at my window sill/ Trees Crackle/ sunshine blares...
I	sit alone, a snake/
I	sit alone and laugh.
BUFFY	Spike! What are you doing?
SPIKE	Nothing. If I don't move. If I don't think. If I don't listen to the voices. Then I won't hurt. Much.
BUFFY	I've got to ask you something.
SPIKE	Don't. Can't hear any more voices.
BUFFY	Spike, there's a girl. She's in danger and I need your help. Now.
SPIKE	I can't, I can't hear you.
BUFFY	Do you know anything? Spike? Is there something, something evil, in the school... down here maybe? Do you know anything?
SPIKE	Yes.
BUFFY	Spike! Stop it! What did you do?
SPIKE	I hurt you Buffy and I will pay. I am paying. Because I hurt the girl.
BUFFY	Spike. No. Not me.
SPIKE	Don't! Don't leave me! Stay here, and help me be quiet.
BUFFY	No, I'm not... I think it's worse when I'm here.
MIKE	No hall pass. I got a free period.
BUFFY	You look kinda upset. Something on your mind?
MIKE	Nah, not really.
I	knew this stuff cold. Pisses me off.
BUFFY	Do you get pissed off a lot?
MIKE	What? No--
BUFFY	Let me cut to the chase here, alright? I hear you can't get a date to the Winter Formal.
MIKE	Um, okay. Look, I know it's your job to talk to kids with problems, but honestly? I'm not one of them. I'm fine. (off her stern look) Anyway, it's no big deal. I got this friend I really want to go with ... but, I don't know. I guess she doesn't see me that way. She makes me crazy--
BUFFY	Crazy?
MIKE	Yeah, Sometimes I wanna -- Hey, that's funny, you're Dawn's sister, right?
BUFFY	Dawn is my sister, That's right.
MIKE	That's so weird. I was just thinking about her. I was thinking, if Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.
BUFFY	You wouldn't be mad at Cassie? With her rejecting you like that?
MIKE	Nah. She's a girl. Making boys crazy is like her job description.
BUFFY	You're asking my sister to the prom? And she's your second choice?
WOOD	Looks like someone's got a coin collection.
MARTIN	You wanted to see me?
BUFFY	You have locker number 174?
MARTIN	Yeah. Why?
BUFFY	I want you to tell me what this is, and what it has to do with a girl called Cassie Newton.
MARTIN	I-I don't know. It's late. I'm going to miss my bus.
BUFFY	I know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around. You need to talk to me. Now.
CASSIE	Well, I guess this is good-bye.
DAWN	No! I mean, hey, I'll walk you home.
CASSIE	That's okay. I'm going to my mom's. It's kind of far.
DAWN	Far sounds good.
CASSIE	Dawn. I know what's going on here.
DAWN	Uh, what?
CASSIE	Buffy told you about me, didn't she? She told you to pretend to be my friend.
DAWN	No! Maybe? Cassie, she was scared. She wanted to help you.
CASSIE	Well, she can't--
DAWN	Maybe she can. She's... different than you think. She's got powers... of helping and she was worried. And now I'm worried. But I wasn't. Pretending. At all. I wanted to be your friend.
CASSIE	You are my friend.
DAWN	Yeah?
CASSIE	Yeah. Just remember, I'm not as stupid as I look.
DAWN	I'm glad.
CASSIE	Listen, Dawn, what happens now? It's not your fault, okay?
NICHOLS	Summers.
DAWN	What is it, Peter?
NICHOLS	I was just wondering if anyone asked you to the Winter Formal.
DAWN	What? Um, no. Not exactly.
NICHOLS	Oh yeah? Well, I was just doing a poll. See ya!
DAWN	That guy is such an ass-- Cassie? Cassie!
MARTIN	Believe me, I'd tell you it I knew anything. I just... don't.
BUFFY	You know why I came back here to Sunnydale High?
MARTIN	To creep me out?
BUFFY	To help. I'm a counselor here because I want to help. I know what it's like to walk these halls and feel lost. Alone... All I want to do is make things better. Connect. And I'm gonna connect with your face if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.
MARTIN	I, please...
CULT	All present?
FIGURES	All present.
NICHOLS	Then we begin.
NICHOLS	O'Keefe, did you take care of the fire exits?
NICHOLS	Fine. No one's getting in.
NICHOLS	The sacrifice.
BUFFY	Okay, that is going on your permanent record.
NICHOLS	It's that counselor. What's she--?
NICHOLS	Back off!
BUFFY	Okay, do you know how lame this is?
NICHOLS	That lame demon?
BUFFY	No!
BUFFY	Spike!
SPIKE	Here to help. No hurting the girl.
BUFFY	You untie her. I'll take...
NICHOLS	Who... are... you?
SPIKE	I'm a bad man.
CASSIE	She'll tell you. Someday she'll tell you.
BUFFY	Are you okay?
NICHOLS	You can't be dead! Where's my infinite riches?
BUFFY	Sorry, my office hours are ten to four.
BUFFY	It's all okay now.
CASSIE	And you will.
BUFFY	Cassie! Cassie!
WILLOW	How was her mother?
BUFFY	Okay. As okay as... she said their family had a history of heart irregularities... but that she never told Cassie. Cassie didn't know that she had, a hole, a hole in her heart.
WILLOW	Cassie didn't know? Then it was fate?
XANDER	She was going to die no matter what, wasn't she? No matter what you did.
BUFFY	She just knew. She was... special. And I failed her.
WILLOW	Buffy, you tried to help.
BUFFY	And I couldn't, I didn't. It's... there're all these kids, you know, and they hurt so bad. I almost forgot, somehow, I almost forgot how much high school hurts.
DAWN	She was my friend.
BUFFY	Oh, Dawnie, I'm so sorry. I failed for you too.
DAWN	Uh-uh. No. You didn't, 'cause you tried. You listened and you tried. She died 'cause of her heart, not 'cause of you She was my friend 'cause of you. I guess maybe sometimes you can't help.
BUFFY	So then what? What do you do when you know that? What do you do when you know maybe you can't help?
DAWN	I think that thing had a child-lock. I'm all cricky. You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I was in the kid coffin for--
XANDER	Thirty-three minutes. Since when did we go to all this effort for one lousy vampire, make that one lousy potential vampire?
BUFFY	Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how. Look, I know it's my job and not yours--
XANDER	No, no, I'm sorry. I want to help. I guess I'm a bit stressed out these days. Sorry to take it out on you.
BUFFY	No big. I'm kinda stressed myself.
DAWN	Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying. She's here. But not here, "part of the gang" here. And hopefully not here, "under my feet 'cause she's in another time- dimension" here.
DAWN	You'll do fine. You'll be a great counselor.
BUFFY	But this week is going to be my first time really talking to kids. What if their problems are all weird and tricky? What if I can't help them?
XANDER	I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. You're perfect for this job.
BUFFY	Yeah, right. Check out perfect me taking my sister on a fun, educational outing to the--
DAWN	Dead body.
XANDER	I dunno, amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean, like natural causes dead.
BUFFY	The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
AMANDA	Hello?
BUFFY	Come in!
AMANDA	Mr. Miller sent me here.
BUFFY	Do you know why?
AMANDA	I'm not sure. Maybe 'cause this guy was picking on me.
BUFFY	But this is a new school. Everyone here is new.
MATTHEW	Yeah, but lots of them know each other from before. I don't have anywhere to sit at lunch. It's stupid. I don't know why I came here--
BUFFY	It's not stupid. It's like the teacher's lounge for me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do in there. I mean, lounge of course, but it's weird. I feel awkward, just like you do.
TOMAS	I'm serious! I'm not talking to you!
BUFFY	Okay.
AMANDA	He said all sorts of things. Stuff about how my clothes are all cheap and I look like a blue-light special.
BUFFY	I'm sorry Amanda.
AMANDA	And then my mom had to go and call him at his house. Telling him that he shouldn't make fun of me, just 'cause she's not rich and she's a single mom and all that. I don't need him knowing my life story.
BUFFY	It's awful being teased. But the thing is, bullies like that? They're just--
AMANDA	Insecure?
BUFFY	Nothing so drastic. Just tomorrow at lunch, you look for someone who's sitting alone. And you sit down next to them.
MATTHEW	Yeah? I don't know.
BUFFY	You could picture them in their underwear, but it might ruin your appetite.
MATTHEW	Yeah, maybe.
BUFFY	You've got to stick up for yourself. Let this bully know that you won't take any sh--guff, from him. Any guff.
AMANDA	I'm glad you said that.
BUFFY	Well, it's true.
AMANDA	Well, 'cause that's what I did. stood up for myself. The other day after class? I jumped him in the parking lot and slammed his stupid-ass insecure face right into the pavement.
BUFFY	You, what ?
AMANDA	I guess that's the other reason Mr. Miller wanted me to see you. I'm glad someone understands me. Do you think I should pound on him some more?
XANDER	I bet she's giving them great advice.
WILLOW	Absolutely. Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just wish she believed it. She's stressing over the whole "college- drop-out-not-actually-qualified" thing. Plus, knowing there's a salivating hellmouth right under their feet... and the whole...
XANDER	"From beneath you it devours."
WILLOW	I know. It's going to be bad. Real bad. And I wonder, will I... If it comes, when it comes, will I be able to help?
XANDER	I think you will.
WILLOW	I don't know. I don't know what I can do. And frankly, I'm scared of what I might do.
XANDER	I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail.
WILLOW	Right. Ouch.
XANDER	So you choke up, then you have control, but no power. It could take ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control; it's a trade-off.
WILLOW	That's actually not a bad analogy. Except, I'm less worried about hitting my thumb and more worried about going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' skulls open like coconuts.
XANDER	Right. Ouch.
WILLOW	Sorry. I don't know, Xander. Being back here? I'm not sure I'm ready.
XANDER	You are, I mean it'll take time.
BUFFY	So, what's on your mind?
NICHOLS	On my mind?
BUFFY	Are you worried about school, friends, girls, your parents--
NICHOLS	Yeah, that's it. My parents.
BUFFY	What about them?
NICHOLS	Um... issues of divorce.
BUFFY	Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.
NICHOLS	Mine are still happily married. It's hard. I feel left out. And...uh, I'm also concerned about... girls!
BUFFY	Yeah.
BUFFY	He sounds like he's pretty tough, your brother.
TOMAS	Yeah. He's, you know, a man. And I'm just, messed up.
BUFFY	You're not messed up. It's not messed up to worry about your brother.
TOMAS	Yeah. I mean, what if he... doesn't come back? What if he gets blown up? I can't sleep 'cause of this.
BUFFY	Have you talked to your brother? Told him how you feel?
TOMAS	Nah. I don't want to. I don't want to talk to him, okay?
BUFFY	Okay.
TOMAS	I'm not going to talk to him!
BUFFY	So, Josh, what's on your mind?
JOSH	Um, I'm worried that I'm gay.
BUFFY	Okay, first of all, I think it's great that you would talk to me about this. And you should know there's nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.
JOSH	I know. It's just, I'm not positive. So I was thinking, why don't you go out on a date with me and I can find out for sure?
DAWN	Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.
BUFFY	I understand. That must be hard.
ANYA	Talk to me.
LULU	I just. I just can't believe he forgot. We've been going out for six years and he forgot my birthday.
ANYA	Ucch. And he didn't do anything? No flowers, no card, no dinner at an extravagantly over-priced restaurant?
LULU	Nothing. And all day long, I kept thinking he was about to surprise me... And I guess he did 'cause - Surprise! - He forgot.
ANYA	What a creepazoid. It's like he didn't just forget your birthday, but the day on which, in keeping with modern American tradition, one's life is celebrated. One's very self. (then; dire) He didn't celebrate your self.
LULU	He didn't, did he?
ANYA	You know what? I think you deserve vengeance.
LULU	Vengeance.
ANYA	How old are you?
LULU	What? I'm... thirty. Why?
ANYA	Just wishful thinking... But imagine if he was forced, for thirt--
LULU	Please don't say that... number. I can't bear to think about it.
ANYA	Did he know this? That you're freaked about being--
LULU	Older? Maybe, yeah. I mean, I did tell him I didn't want to make a big deal about it.
ANYA	No big deal. Like no cake, no party, no presents, no big deal?
LULU	I may have said something like that. But I didn't say no card ! I wouldn't have minded a card. As long as it had no specifics, you know, no mention that I'm...
ANYA	Thirty isn't old. Believe me. But anyway, this boyfriend of yours - it sounds like maybe he was just trying to do what you wanted.
LULU	Yeah. But it wasn't what I wanted. It was what I said I wanted but, I guess it wasn't what I really wanted.
ANYA	But he tried. I mean, he tried to respect your wishes.
LULU	Yeah, he did. It's kind of sweet if you think about it. But now I'm sad I didn't have a party.
ANYA	It's not too late. You could just celebrate being twenty-nine again.
LULU	I could do that. Yeah. Maybe I could get a piñata.
ANYA	Knock yourself out.
BUFFY	So you're not doing your homework.
CASSIE	I guess not. It all seems kind of, whatever.
BUFFY	I know high school can be frustrating. But if you just get through it, then you can go to college or join the French Foreign Legion or anything you want.
CASSIE	Yeah. Well, I'm not going to do all that stuff.
BUFFY	Okay, so no French Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean, all the changing your name and being indentured for years and occupying Algeria.
CASSIE	It's just, I'm not graduating from high school.
BUFFY	Why not?
CASSIE	I like that shirt. Where did you--
BUFFY	Don't change the subject, Cassie why wouldn't you graduate?
CASSIE	Because next Friday I'm gonna die.
CASSIE	Can we talk, about something else?
BUFFY	No. We have to talk about this.
CASSIE	Just, never mind...
BUFFY	Cassie, what makes you feel like this?
CASSIE	Feel like what?
BUFFY	Like you want to... hurt yourself.
CASSIE	I'm not going to commit suicide, if that's what you're saying. No way.
BUFFY	Okay. Then, what, what are you saying?
CASSIE	Look, I don't mean to be a pain, you seem really nice, and I know you just want to help, but I'm just wasting your time.
BUFFY	No, you're not. This is why I'm here. Tell me why you think you're going to die.
CASSIE	I don't think it; I know it. I just, know .
BUFFY	What do you mean, you know? Are you saying you know someone wants to hurt you? Has someone threatened you?
CASSIE	No. I just know next Friday I'm going to die. Some things, I just know. I don't know how I do, I just do. Like, I know there's gonna be coins.
BUFFY	Coins?
CASSIE	Lots of coins. Weird ones. And I know you'll go someplace, dark... underground. I don't know...
BUFFY	What do you mean, underground?
CASSIE	And I know you'll try to help.
BUFFY	Cassie, I don't understand what you're--
BUFFY	I--
CASSIE	Thanks for being nice. And I really do like that shirt. The color's good for you. You should put on a sweater so it doesn't get stained.
BUFFY	Cassie, wait--
CASSIE	I gotta go.
BUFFY	What am I supposed to do?
WOOD	You did what you were supposed to. You reported the situation to me.
BUFFY	And?
WOOD	And...
BUFFY	The hood?
WOOD	Beverly Hills. Which is a hood. (off her discomfort) The point is - I was talking big because I was scared. I couldn't bust a move in high school, let alone an ass. Most of the time that's what it is when students act out. Fear, pain...
BUFFY	But sometimes, sometimes it's not just talk, right?
WOOD	One in a hundred, maybe two hundred, they're for real.
BUFFY	So what do we do? How do we help her?
WOOD	Every time there's a threat like this, we do the same dance.
CASSIE	Don't you have a history test to study for?
MIKE	Why don't you design a tattoo for me?
CASSIE	A tattoo? Yeah, right. I can just picture that.
MIKE	C'mon, design something and we can get matching tattoos. Maybe like a snake with some fire coming out of it's mouth.
CASSIE	Or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when you flex?
MIKE	Now you're talking. Like a sexy hula girl, but a sexy snake hula girl.
CASSIE	What do you mean "after all"? I told you I don't want to go.
MIKE	I assumed you were kidding.
CASSIE	It'd probably just be lame anyway.
MIKE	Yeah, but lame is funny. And maybe fun. If we're, you know, hanging out together.
CASSIE	We hang out all the time.
MIKE	Right. And therefore, we should hang out at the Winter Formal.
DAWN	Hey.
CASSIE	Right. Hey, Dawn. I like your ashtray work.
DAWN	Thanks. They can also be used as jewelry holders.
CASSIE	That's the genius. There was an assignment but I didn't write it down. Something to do with glazes -
MIKE	As scintillating as this pottery talk is, I'd better go and actually study. I'm Mike, by the way. Cassie talks about your ashtrays all the time.
DAWN	Hi. Sorry. I didn't mean to-
MIKE	Don't worry about it. I gotta hit the books if I'm going to ace this test like it deserves to be aced. It was nice meeting you though. Cass, I'll see you later?
CASSIE	Hey Mike! You're going to get a B.
MIKE	A-plus baby, A-plus.
DAWN	Is that any good?
CASSIE	Yeah, actually, yeah.
DAWN	What do you have to read it for?
CASSIE	Oh, just for me I guess. I've pretty much stopped reading my school assignments. I just read what I want.
DAWN	That's so cool. I'd do that, but my sister would be down my neck in a second.
CASSIE	Summers. Hey, is your sister Ms. Summers the counselor?
DAWN	Yeah, lucky me, huh?
CASSIE	Nah, she's nice. I saw her this morning actually.
DAWN	Oh yeah? What about?
CASSIE	Oh, I don't care.
DAWN	So. Mike's a cutie. Are you guys going to that dance?
CASSIE	I don't think so.
DAWN	Oh, I...I mean, didn't he ask you?
CASSIE	Only like a hundred and five times.
DAWN	You said no?
CASSIE	A hundred and six times. I, I can't go. I'm not going to be around that night.
BUFFY	Cassie's records all show the same story - Good grades, good kid. Then suddenly, not so good grades, absenteeism, comments about apathy and depression.
XANDER	So, the question is, what changed?
BUFFY	Right. If she did have some kind of psychic vision, that would explain it. I mean, it's hard to do homework if you think you're about to die.
WILLOW	You really think this girl is some kind of precog?
BUFFY	I don't know. Maybe. I told you how she--
XANDER	Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. I'm not saying you don't have Slayer Grace? But it's not the first time.
WILLOW	Maybe, just maybe, you're trying so hard to help, that you're seeing paranormal where there's just normal. Depressed normal, but normal.
BUFFY	Maybe. But, maybe not.
WILLOW	Want me to check medical records?
BUFFY	Her doctor already sent them.
XANDER	Strep throat, ear infections, yeast infection, none of my business. No real info here.
BUFFY	We got zip. And we're running out of days.
WILLOW	Have you Googled her?
XANDER	Willow! She's seventeen!
WILLOW	It's a search engine. Look.
XANDER	A day and a half of researching and we finally try looking up her .
BUFFY	Wow. Lotta poems here.
XANDER	Poems. Always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
WILLOW	The sheets above me cool my skin/ like dirt on a mad woman's grave/
XANDER	Okay... Death really is on her brain.
DAWN	We all deal with death...
XANDER	But this girl isn't just dealing. She's giving death a long sloppy word kiss. She has a yen for the big dirt nap.
WILLOW	I don't know. A lot of teenagers post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. I even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day.
XANDER	Love poems?
WILLOW	I'm over you now, Sweetie.
XANDER	Love poems.
WILLOW	Look, all I'm saying is this is normal teen stuff, You join chat rooms, you write poems, you post Doogie Howser fan fic. It's normal. Right? Let's see if there're any other sites.
WILLOW	I think we've seen most of this. Here's something, oh no, it's " Phillip Newton."
BUFFY	That's her dad. Open that.
DAWN	I'm telling you I got this case cracked wide open. I got the suspect fingered. I told you about Mike Warburton, right?
BUFFY	The one who asked her to the dance?
DAWN	Right. The one who keeps asking her to the dance. I'm thinking, who likes to be rejected? Nobody. I'm thinking, some people can't handle rejection. I'm thinking--
WILLOW	I got something here!
BUFFY	Her dad's a drunk.
XANDER	A violent drunk?
BUFFY	We better find out. Here's his address. Xand, you got your keys?
BUFFY	Buffy the Vampire Slayer would just kick down this door.
XANDER	And Buffy the counselor?
BUFFY	Waits.
NEWTON	That's right.
BUFFY	I work at your daughter's school. I need to talk to you.
NEWTON	Is she screwing up her grades again? She's not the sharpest apple in the barrel.
BUFFY	She's having some problems. But it's kind of you I want to talk about.
NEWTON	What about?
BUFFY	I know you got picked up by the police a couple times. Are you still drinking a lot?
NEWTON	What's that got to do with Cassie?
XANDER	You tell us.
NEWTON	What's this, "You tell us"? Who do you two think you are, McMillan and Wife?
XANDER	He looked at me. He just said "wife" and looked at me.
BUFFY	Xander. Mr. Newton, I don't know exactly how to ask this...
NEWTON	Ask what? Look, I let you into my house, but I'm tired and I got things to do.
NEWTON	Oh, I see. That's all, You come in here in the middle of the night, into my home, and start accusing me of beating on my daughter? That's all ?
BUFFY	We just want to make sure--
NEWTON	Well, that's a lie. Who told you-- Did Cassie's mother put you up to this? 'Cause I pay my support, okay? To the dime. She just wants to take away the one weekend a month I get to see my girl.
BUFFY	Which is when?
NEWTON	What?
BUFFY	Which weekend is it?
NEWTON	I just had her. Last weekend. Look, I may not be the greatest dad in the world. But I don't beat up my girl. I don't-
BUFFY	Will you see her this Friday?
NEWTON	Not unless my ex-wife gets a personality transplant.
BUFFY	Okay.
NEWTON	Okay, what? Okay, now you'll yet out of my house?
BUFFY	Yeah. Yeah, we will.
NEWTON	Is that a threat?
BUFFY	Shouldn't it be a comfort?
CASSIE	It's not him. He's not the one who does it. (to Buffy) Thank you for trying. But I probably shouldn't have told you anything. You're making such a big deal and I want it all to just...go away.
XANDER	Are you talking about... killing yourself?
CASSIE	No! Of course not.
BUFFY	Then fight. Try.
CASSIE	There's no point. I told you-
BUFFY	See, that doesn't sound like someone who really wants to live.
CASSIE	How can you say that? You think I want this? That I don't care?
BUFFY	Cassie, no. You will. You will. You just have to tell us what you know. Everything about this... Please, please, help us.
CASSIE	I can't. I just know. It's going to happen. I don't know why and I don't know how. But something out there is going to kill me.
BUFFY	Oh!
WOOD	Sorry, didn't mean to...
BUFFY	It's okay. I just didn't sleep much.
WOQD	It's been a long week, huh?
SPIKE	Nothing. If I don't move. If I don't think. If I don't listen to the voices. Then I won't hurt. Much.
BUFFY	I've got to ask you something.
SPIKE	Don't. Can't hear any more voices.
BUFFY	Spike, there's a girl. She's in danger and I need your help. Now.
SPIKE	I can't, I can't hear you.
BUFFY	Do you know anything? Spike? Is there something, something evil, in the school... down here maybe? Do you know anything?
SPIKE	I hurt you Buffy and I will pay. I am paying. Because I hurt the girl.
BUFFY	Spike. No. Not me.
SPIKE	Don't! Don't leave me! Stay here, and help me be quiet.
BUFFY	No, I'm not... I think it's worse when I'm here.
MIKE	No hall pass. I got a free period.
BUFFY	You look kinda upset. Something on your mind?
MIKE	Nah, not really.
I	knew this stuff cold. Pisses me off.
BUFFY	Do you get pissed off a lot?
MIKE	What? No--
BUFFY	Let me cut to the chase here, alright? I hear you can't get a date to the Winter Formal.
MIKE	Um, okay. Look, I know it's your job to talk to kids with problems, but honestly? I'm not one of them. I'm fine. (off her stern look) Anyway, it's no big deal. I got this friend I really want to go with ... but, I don't know. I guess she doesn't see me that way. She makes me crazy--
BUFFY	Crazy?
MIKE	Yeah, Sometimes I wanna -- Hey, that's funny, you're Dawn's sister, right?
BUFFY	Dawn is my sister, That's right.
MIKE	That's so weird. I was just thinking about her. I was thinking, if Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.
BUFFY	You wouldn't be mad at Cassie? With her rejecting you like that?
MIKE	Nah. She's a girl. Making boys crazy is like her job description.
MARTIN	You wanted to see me?
BUFFY	You have locker number 174?
MARTIN	Yeah. Why?
BUFFY	I want you to tell me what this is, and what it has to do with a girl called Cassie Newton.
MARTIN	I-I don't know. It's late. I'm going to miss my bus.
BUFFY	I know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around. You need to talk to me. Now.
DAWN	No! I mean, hey, I'll walk you home.
CASSIE	That's okay. I'm going to my mom's. It's kind of far.
DAWN	Far sounds good.
CASSIE	Dawn. I know what's going on here.
DAWN	Uh, what?
CASSIE	Buffy told you about me, didn't she? She told you to pretend to be my friend.
DAWN	No! Maybe? Cassie, she was scared. She wanted to help you.
CASSIE	Well, she can't--
CASSIE	You are my friend.
DAWN	Yeah?
CASSIE	Yeah. Just remember, I'm not as stupid as I look.
DAWN	I'm glad.
CASSIE	Listen, Dawn, what happens now? It's not your fault, okay?
NICHOLS	Summers.
DAWN	What is it, Peter?
NICHOLS	I was just wondering if anyone asked you to the Winter Formal.
DAWN	What? Um, no. Not exactly.
BUFFY	You know why I came back here to Sunnydale High?
MARTIN	To creep me out?
BUFFY	To help. I'm a counselor here because I want to help. I know what it's like to walk these halls and feel lost. Alone... All I want to do is make things better. Connect. And I'm gonna connect with your face if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.
MARTIN	I, please...
NICHOLS	O'Keefe, did you take care of the fire exits?
NICHOLS	Fine. No one's getting in.
NICHOLS	The sacrifice.
BUFFY	Okay, that is going on your permanent record.
NICHOLS	It's that counselor. What's she--?
BUFFY	Okay, do you know how lame this is?
BUFFY	Spike!
SPIKE	Here to help. No hurting the girl.
BUFFY	You untie her. I'll take...
NICHOLS	Who... are... you?
SPIKE	I'm a bad man.
BUFFY	Sorry, my office hours are ten to four.
WILLOW	How was her mother?
BUFFY	Okay. As okay as... she said their family had a history of heart irregularities... but that she never told Cassie. Cassie didn't know that she had, a hole, a hole in her heart.
WILLOW	Cassie didn't know? Then it was fate?
XANDER	She was going to die no matter what, wasn't she? No matter what you did.
BUFFY	She just knew. She was... special. And I failed her.
WILLOW	Buffy, you tried to help.
BUFFY	And I couldn't, I didn't. It's... there're all these kids, you know, and they hurt so bad. I almost forgot, somehow, I almost forgot how much high school hurts.
DAWN	She was my friend.
BUFFY	Oh, Dawnie, I'm so sorry. I failed for you too.
DAWN	Uh-uh. No. You didn't, 'cause you tried. You listened and you tried. She died 'cause of her heart, not 'cause of you She was my friend 'cause of you. I guess maybe sometimes you can't help.
BUFFY	So then what? What do you do when you know that? What do you do when you know maybe you can't help?

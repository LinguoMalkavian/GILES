FORREST	Think any of them are going to show? 'Cause the party'll be lame if we lack for hotties. Hey. Professor. You with me?
RILEY	(not looking up) No, I'm with this large pile of ungraded papers due at three o'clock
FORREST	How are you going to learn anything if you keep doing schoolwork? Oh. Check her out. Is she hot or is she hot?
RILEY	She's Buffy.
FORREST	Buffy. I like that. "That girl's so hot, she's Buffy."
RILEY	It's her name Forrest.
FORREST	You've established first contact? Excellent, what do you think of her?
RILEY	I never really thought of what I think about her.
FORREST	A girl that cute in the face and you've formed no opinion?
RILEY	No, I mean.. .She's all right ,I guess. She's just kind of, I dunno... Peculiar.
FORREST	Peculiar.
RILEY	Uh huh.
FORREST	Hey Graham. What do you think of the blond chick? Mattressable, n'est pas?
RILEY	I don't dislike her. She just never feels like she's really there when you talk to her. I like girls you can get a grip on.
FORREST	I'll bet you do.
RILEY	Not that way. Just a little less ready for takeoff all the time.
GRAHAM	Maybe she's Canadian.
FORREST	Didn't she go out with Parker Abrams for like thirty seconds?
RILEY	(a bit bothered by that) Abrams? Yeah, there's a sign of good taste...
FORREST	Okay. But you've got to admit she's a major league hottie.
RILEY	I'm not denying she's easy on the eyes, I'm just saying...
FORREST	Hell yes! I bet there's a lot of guys who'd like to get their hands on her.
GILES	There, based on Buffy's description, I believe the men we're after look something like ... this.
XANDER	The latest in fall fascism, I like it. A little full in the hips for my taste, but...
GILES	I think we can safely assume they're human. So, no need to research.
XANDER	No studying... damn!
GILES	Not very much, I'm afraid. It seems, once Again, you and I won't be needed to help Buffy.
XANDER	Really?
GILES	Really.
XANDER	Well, then how about this: we whip out the Ouija board, light a few candles, summon some ancient unstoppable evil - Mayhem Mayhem Mayhem - we show up, kick its ass.
GILES	That might be unethical.
BUFFY	Hey guys. Ooh, look. It's my late night stormtrooper pal.
GILES	It's just for reference. But you'd say it's fairly accurate?
BUFFY	That's your man.
GILES	Your man, actually. You are patrolling tonight?
BUFFY	Nope. I am going to a party tonight. Hopefully, a "no fighting, no biting" kind of deal.
GILES	Someone's got to find out what those people are --
BUFFY	Giles, I'm in a dorm now filled with what the young people these days call "young people". The girls in my hall want to party, I'm taking Willow, try to cheer her up.
XANDER	How's Will doing with the ...?
BUFFY	... The black hole of despair she's lived in since Oz left? She's dealing, I'm helping. It's hard. Ergo, party.
GILES	Buffy, I appreciate your loyalty to a friend, but this...
BUFFY	(re: sketch) Look. No horns, no claws, no slime. The bad guy's just a guy, so you two can take patrol. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to pick out something slutty for tonight.
GILES	Well, looks like we got our work cut out for us after all.
XANDER	Sweet.
SPIKE	Uh-huh. And who are you, mate?
TOM	(laughs eerily) I'm a rat. I'm a lab rat - like the others (scared whisper) They're gonna kill us, you know.
SPIKE	And how are "they" going to do that?
TOM	They starve you. And when you're ready to bite your own arm, they shoot out one of those packets. You drink, and the next thing you know - you're gone. That's when they do the experiments.
SPIKE	And "they" are .... the government? Nazis? A major cosmetics company?
TOM	Who cares? All I know is, one minute I'm running from the Slayer, and the next thing, I'm here...
SPIKE	The Slayer. I knew it. I KNEW IT!
TOM	She took apart my crew and drove me straight to these guys.
SPIKE	She set me up, too!
BUFFY	Stupid pen...
WILLOW	Ballpoints are tricky.
WILLOW	Hey. Riley. Hi. Um, I noticed you left a name off the role call today. Osbourne. Daniel Osbourne? Oz.
RILEY	He's not in this class anymore. I heard he dropped out.
WILLOW	Oh, you heard way wrong then. He's not gone. He just left temporarily - to work out a few things. That sounds lame in its vagueness I know, but I assure you, Oz will be back.
WALSH	Not to my class he won't.
WILLOW	Oh, but...
WALSH	It is. To you. But, since I'm neither a freshman or a narcissist, I have the whole class to consider. If your friend can't respect my schedule, I think it's best he not come back.
BUFFY	You know, for someone who teaches human behavior? You might try showing some.
WALSH	It's not my job to coddle my students.
BUFFY	That's right. A human being in pain has nothing to do with your job.
WALSH	I like her.
RILEY	Really? You don't think she's a little peculiar?
XANDER	Here we go. Gear for tonight. If some commando squad's out there fully loaded, these babies might give us the edge we'll need.
GILES	Very impressive. Where'd it all come from?
XANDER	Requisitioned it back when I was military guy.
GILES	That was over two years ago. Are you sure you're still a hundred percent?
XANDER	You kidding? I put the "semper" in semper fi. Maybe I can't assemble an M-16 blindfolded like I used to. Or pass weapons drill for the mobile infantry...
GILES	I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.
XANDER	Fear not. Hand to hand? I'm still the man. Let's hit it. Remember: Whoever these guys trained with, there's no way they're ready to deal with ...
XANDER	(swallowing shame) Yeah, Mom?
GILES	Raspberry fruit punch?
RILEY	So she says, "You teach human behavior, maybe you ought to show some."
FORREST	You are lying. She said this to Walsh?
RILEY	Hope to die.
FORREST	Oh, like you've never wanted to tell the Professor off.
PARKER	Forrest, what's up?
FORREST	What's the scoop on Buffy Summers? Is she cool?
PARKER	Buffy? She's all right, I guess. I mean, kinda whiney...
FORREST	How's that?
PARKER	Well, you know, clingy... I mean we got a little physical - well, fully physical - and then she's all over me, you know, like we're betrothed or something.
FORREST	But fun was had, yeah?
PARKER	Oh yeah! The word is stamina.
RILEY	I can't believe I did that.
FORREST	Welcome to the club! You have any idea how much trouble you could've gotten into? If Parker reported you -
GRAHAM	He won't. He's too embarrassed.
RILEY	I hit him.
FORREST	What the hell for?
RILEY	He was just being so crude...
FORREST	Please! You've heard me say much grosser things than that --
RILEY	-- and a lot of those were about your own mom! What is it that...
FORREST	You're kind of like a moron.
RILEY	So you knew that I had feelings for her.
GRAHAM	Everybody knows, man...
FORREST	'Oh, she's peculiar...' Dead giveaway, Buddy! --She's strange, she bothers me...'
RILEY	I'm always the last to know.
FORREST	So whatchya gonna do?
RILEY	Guess I'm gonna see a girl. And smiling, he takes off.
SPIKE	Sorry, can't stay. Gotta go see a girl.
SPIKE	Aaah!!!
TOM	Let me out!
SPIKE	Bit busy just now ...
TOM	I know where the exit is. You spring me, you're free. You don't, and you're dead.
SPIKE	New plan: we split up.
WILLOW	Oh. Riley. Hi.
RILEY	Hi. Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting anything really depressing.
WILLOW	What's up?
RILEY	Right to the point. Okay. I was thinking of asking out Buffy.
WILLOW	She's not here.
RILEY	I know. See, I don't know much about Buffy. But I'm interested in what she likes, and so far, the only thing that I know she likes is you.
WILLOW	But what do you want me to do?
RILEY	Just tell me something. Anything, some kind of clue to ... here let me help you with that.
WILLOW	(big sigh) Okay. Let's say I help. And you start a conversation. It goes great. You like Buffy. She likes you. You spend time together. Feelings grow deeper, and one day without even realizing it, you find you're in love. Time stops and it feels like the whole world's made for you two and you two alone until the day one of you leaves the other and rips the still-beating heart from the other who's now a broken, hollow mockery of the human condition.
RILEY	Yep. That's the plan.
WILLOW	I figured it was.
RILEY	Look, if you wanna tell me to go to hell that's okay... Maybe this is the last thing you wanna talk about. I just feel like -- well I've never courted anyone like Buffy before. I don't think I've ever met anyone like Buffy before.
WILLOW	Why should I trust you?
RILEY	I was just hoping you'd think I have an honest face.
WILLOW	I've seen honest faces. They usually come attached to liars.
RILEY	All right, I guess I'm not gonna win here. I appreciate you wanting to protect your friend. I guess she kind of brings that out in people. Whatever's causing that music, I uh, hope it works out.
WILLOW	She likes cheese.
RILEY	What?
WILLOW	I'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but Buffy? She likes cheese.
RILEY	That's a start.
WILLOW	And she has a stuffed piggy named Mr. Gordo, loves Ice Capades without the irony and she's dragging me to a party at Lowell House tonight.
RILEY	Oh you're going! That's my house. I live there.
WILLOW	Then that will give you a chance to interact. But don't get fresh!
RILEY	Fresh? I don't even know if we like each other yet. Does she ever talk about me? Has she ever ?
WILLOW	(polite smile) Sorry.
RILEY	That's discouraging. Still, I feel like I've got a fighting chance with my new accomplice.
WILLOW	I'm not your accomplice.
RILEY	No, no, course not.
WILLOW	I'm not.
RILEY	You're not.
WILLOW	We're clear?
RILEY	We're clear.
HARMONY	Spike? Spike, is that really you?
SPIKE	It's me, baby, your man is...
HARMONY	Bastard! You dumped me and staked me and hurt me and left me and...
SPIKE	I know, sugar, but you're forgetting one other thing I did. I missed you.
HARMONY	Really?
SPIKE	Never, my little foam latte. Your blondie bear is here to stay.
HARMONY	Where have you been? No. Wait, don't tell me. I'm just glad you're back. This time it's for good, right?
SPIKE	Forever and ever, mon petit creme brulee.
HARMONY	Ooh. Italian.
SPIKE	Uh, yeah. And get used to it. Big Daddy's home. We're gonna go wherever you want, do whatever you want, kill whoever you want. Starting with the slayer. And after that, it's all you and me, my little... ... mentholated pack of smokes.
HARMONY	Spikey. Leave the Slayer alone. You know she'll only slap you around. I can do that
SPIKE	Ow! No, see ... ow. The head, love, watch the head, watch ...
GILES	Oh, shut up.
XANDER	Just setting the mood, big guy.
GILES	I don't think I ever fully appreciated how Buffy deals with this every night.
XANDER	Buffster's the champ. Way she deals with the boredom. The violence. And all without these tasty little cucumber sandwiches to keep her going...
GILES	Still, it's nice to be able to make oneself useful. I dare say we'll see some action before the night is through.
XANDER	Commandos'll never see us coming. We're shadows, we're the wind, unseen and un--
FRESHMAN	You guys know which way's Mather House?
BUFFY	Looks cool.
WILLOW	Uh huh.
BUFFY	'Cause we could go...
WILLOW	No, no. we're here for fun.
BUFFY	Hey! Our whole dorm is here, of course. You wanna...?
WILLOW	You go, I need a soda.
BUFFY	You want me to --
WILLOW	I'm okay. Really.
RILEY	So, what do I do?
WILLOW	You ask her to dance.
RILEY	Right. Dance. Wait. No.
WILLOW	(looking at him) What's wrong?
RILEY	I can't dance.
WILLOW	Then talk. Keep eye contact, funny is good, but don't be glib and remember: if you hurt her, I will beat you to death with a shovel.
RILEY	'Scuse me. Pardon. Hi. Buffy?
BUFFY	Yeah.
RILEY	Wow. Some theories, huh?
XANDER	Harmony.
HARMONY	Xander.
XANDER	That's close enough.
HARMONY	I can kill you where you stand.
XANDER	Bring it on, then.
HARMONY	Ooh! Sissy kicker!
XANDER	Ow - ooh - quit - cut it out ... !
HARMONY	I'm just - just - just - so gonna bite you ... ow!
XANDER	Okay, stop. Stop. We both just stop. Okay?
HARMONY	I will if you will.
XANDER	On three, okay? Ready, one, two ..
HARMONY	My fire? Oh, right. Like I'd ever listen to the... "Sex Pistols." Eww. This crap belongs to Spike.
XANDER	Spike?
HARMONY	(lighting a match) Can you believe him? Comes back, with all these big promises, not that I believed him but he could have spent one night but no everything was "Slayer this" and "Slayer that," he probably killed her already but still I'm not taking him back. I just want to know why is it men always ...
RILEY	I can't believe it. I choked.
WILLOW	You really, really did.
RILEY	You don't understand. I'm good at things. That's what I do. Work hard, apply myself, get it done.
WILLOW	You failed extremely well.
RILEY	That's a great comfort to me.
WILLOW	You have to relax. You're not proposing -- I sincerely hope -- you're just making contact. Getting a reaction. Any reaction is okay, except projectile vomiting and what are the chances of --
RILEY	Are you okay?
WILLOW	The song...
RILEY	It's a tape of some bands from last year's party. Associations?
WILLOW	(small voice) Big.
RILEY	Bad?
WILLOW	Thank you. Now go find Buffy.
RILEY	There's no hurry... If you want to talk...
WILLOW	I want you to tell Buffy that I went home and not to worry about me. Which will at least give you something to say.
RILEY	Thanks.
WILLOW	You'll do fine.
RILEY	Hey, Willow said to say she took off. She's okay. Kind of blue, but said not to worry.
BUFFY	Thanks.
RILEY	You know, I wanted to ask you something.
BUFFY	Ask away.
XANDER	Buffy! I've been looking all over for you. We...
BUFFY	Business. Right, Excuse us?
RILEY	No problem.
FORREST	Denied.
RILEY	It's not like she blew me off, she just left with another guy, is all.
FORREST	We need you downstairs anyway.
FORREST	You know I hate to say this but they're probably on their way to make crazy naked sex.
RILEY	Is that necessary?
FORREST	I'm only protecting you, buddy. I don't want you mooning over some freshman for the next three months.
VOICE	Retinal scan accepted.
GRAHAM	I like her. I'm on your side here.
RILEY	I know you are, Graham...
RILEY	... and that's what gives me the strength to put up with this comedian.
FORREST	Dude - straight tip - I know about girls.
RILEY	Exactly! Girls, plural. I'm talking about one girl.
VOICE	Initiative Vocal code match complete. Special Agent - Finn Riley. Identity number seven, five, three, two, nine.
RILEY	Problem is, what kind of girl's gonna go out with a guy who's acting all Joe Regular by day...
GRAHAM	Maybe a peculiar one.
RILEY	(genuinely touched) Thank you, Graham.
WALSH	Suit up, gentlemen. We have a code red. Hostile Seventeen has escaped.
WALSH	Here's what we know and it isn't much: hostile Seventeen broke restraints at exactly ten forty- seven p.m.
FORREST	That's a big head start...
WALSH	Gets bigger every time you interrupt me. It was bagged and tagged locally, so assume it knows the area. The creature has every advantage right now. Fail to recapture it, and everything we've worked for, the Initiative itself - could end tonight.
RILEY	Nobody's failing on my watch.
WALSH	Glad to hear it.
RILEY	We start with a basic mobilization pattern, three teams. Sweep and search, just like practice. Thorough but fast, C-Team ...
BUFFY	Doesn't Spike get that this is my town?
GILES	He's resilient...
BUFFY	And it's my night off!
XANDER	I'm sure he'd pick another night if he knew you were busy with the Teutonic boy toy.
BUFFY	What's that supposed to mean?
XANDER	Nothing.
BUFFY	Riley's a doof. He's not Teutonic.
GILES	We have to assume you're Spike's main target, Buffy.
BUFFY	Fine. He's worn out his welcome. Tonight, I kill him.
GILES	You have a plan?
BUFFY	I am the plan. If Spike wants me? I go alone, lead him away from the popular spots, and give him what he wants.
XANDER	Wait. Take this.
BUFFY	A flare gun? Xander, if I see Spike I'm staking him, not signaling ships at sea.
XANDER	You get into trouble...
BUFFY	I'll flare.
XANDER	And we'll come a-runnin'.
GILES	I'm sure of it.
SPIKE	Hello, gorgeous.
RILEY	What've we got?
GRAHAM	Civilian, sir.
RILEY	Damn.
GRAHAM	She's compromising the area.
FORREST	At least she's not making crazy naked sex.
RILEY	Told you. We have to clear her out, and fast.
FORREST	Maybe not. Just thinking. If you were Hostile Seventeen, living on that crap we feed 'em, what would you rather eat than that?
RILEY	You want to use the girl I have a crush on as bait?
FORREST	I can tag a hostile at fifty yards.
RILEY	Denied.
FORREST	She'd be safe the entire ...
RILEY	I said denied, agent!
FORREST	Did you just pull rank on me?
RILEY	You got a problem with that?
FORREST	No, sir.
GRAHAM	So? How do we get her out of there?
BUFFY	Riley! What are you doing here?
RILEY	Didn't get a chance to say goodbye at the party, you left so fast. You know, with your friend who's a boy.
BUFFY	Who, Xander? Oh, he's not ... anyone I want to talk about. You know, I don't want you taking this the wrong way, but I need a little alone time now. Alone.
RILEY	Why?
BUFFY	I need space.
RILEY	We're outdoors.
BUFFY	I mean emotionally.
RILEY	You know there's plenty of space back in your room. Why don't I take you?
BUFFY	Whoa! It's a free campus. Who died and made you John Wayne?
RILEY	I'm trying to help you.
BUFFY	You think I need help? Believe me, I don't. And if you were a real gentleman you would go. Far, far away by now. Well? Go on. Shoo!
RILEY	Are you drunk?
BUFFY	Yes. Report me.
RILEY	I'm taking you home.
BUFFY	Maybe I'm taking you home, ever thought of that? What is it, you think boys can take care of themselves and girls need help?
RILEY	Yeah.
BUFFY	Oh, that is so Teutonic.
RILEY	Look, Buffy, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
BUFFY	And as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
RILEY	Gotta go.
BUFFY	See ya.
RILEY	Tell me we're tracking.
GRAHAM	Honing a signal ... got it. Heading west.
RILEY	It better be the hostile.
FORREST	All units converge, all units converge, hard target sighted, heading one two alpha niner.
RILEY	Let's bag it before this gets ugly.
WILLOW	Come in.
SPIKE	I'll give you a choice: Now, I'm going to kill you. No choice in that. But ......
WILLOW	I'll scream.
SPIKE	Bonus.
SPIKE	I don't understand. This sort of thing has never happened to me before.
WILLOW	Maybe you were nervous.
SPIKE	I felt all right when we started. Let's try again. He suddenly lunges at Willow, mouth open.
WILLOW	You're probably just trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
SPIKE	Not to me, it doesn't!
WILLOW	It's me, isn't it?
SPIKE	What are you talking about?
WILLOW	You came looking for Buffy, then settled. You didn't want to bite me, I just happened to be around.
SPIKE	Don't be ridiculous. Why, I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
WILLOW	Really?
SPIKE	Thought about it.
WILLOW	When?
SPIKE	Remember last year? You had on that fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath...
WILLOW	I never would have guessed. You play the blood-lust kind of cool.
SPIKE	I hate being obvious. All fang-y and *grrr.* Takes all the mystery out.
WILLOW	But if you could, you'd ...
SPIKE	If I could, yeah.
WILLOW	You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.
SPIKE	Don't patronize me.
GRAHAM	And ... getting a picture ... signatures locked.
RILEY	What have we got?
GRAHAM	Humans of the freshman variety. Ninety-eight six, ninety-eight six, and ... bingo.
FORREST	Vampire.
RILEY	Call in a standard triangle flanking manoeuver. We're going in. (into radio) I need a lockdown on grid six.
SPIKE	I'm only a hundred and twenty-six.
WILLOW	You're being too hard on yourself. Why don't we both just wait half an hour and try again? Or .....
RILEY	Hold your fire!
GRAHAM	It's on me!
RILEY	Bag and tag it - we're gone.
FORREST	Sir!
RILEY	Leave her.
FORREST	We can't neglect quarantine, sir!
GRAHAM	Stop her!
FORREST	She's contained.
FORREST	Yaahhh!! I'm blind!
GRAHAM	What the hell is that?
BUFFY	Go.
SPIKE	Too weird.
FORREST	Hostile's escaped, sir!
GRAHAM	Orders?
RILEY	Abort!
WALSH	I'm sure you'll understand if I seem far from happy.
RILEY	Yes ma'am. If you read my report you'll see...
WALSH	Hostile Seventeen's found an accomplice who's smart, aggressive, and somehow escapes description.
FORREST	Whoever he was, the guy was big.
GRAHAM	Strong, too.
RILEY	Whoever or whatever.
WALSH	I'm not interested in guesswork, gentlemen. Call me old-fashioned, I like results. This report ..
RILEY	The implant works. Hostile Seventeen can't hurt any living creature, in any way without intense neurological pain. We'll bag it.
WALSH	Yes, you will. Dismissed.
RILEY	Hey.
BUFFY	Hi.
RILEY	Listen, sorry about last night.
BUFFY	No, I was rude -
RILEY	No -
BUFFY	Just felt like being alone. Sometimes, at night, it's nice to be out by yourself.
RILEY	I hear that. Gotta be careful though. Lotta strange... people out there.
BUFFY	Oh yeah.
RILEY	How's Willow doing?
BUFFY	Okay. 'Course that stupid fraternity prank on our hall didn't help any.
RILEY	That's right, you guys live in Stevenson.
BUFFY	How'd you know that?
RILEY	Well, Willow and I were... I thought she might be able to help me on a project.
BUFFY	Really? That work out?
RILEY	Don't know yet.
BUFFY	Was there something -- at the party, you wanted to tell me something?
RILEY	Oh yes. Very important stuff. Interesting, a little edgy, daring views on... I don't remember any of it now, but you would have been fascinated, possibly very moved... Did Willow tell you I like cheese?
BUFFY	You're a little peculiar.
RILEY	I can live with that.
RILEY	Gotta go.
BUFFY	See ya.

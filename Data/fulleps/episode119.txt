WILLOW	When did morning happen?
TARA	After the moon went down.
WILLOW	Mmm. I forgot how good this could feel. Us. Together. Without the magic.
TARA	There was plenty of magic, Will.
WILLOW	It's getting late.
TARA	You want to get up?
WILLOW	No. God, no. I was just thinking about Buffy.
TARA	Oh. She's still not back?
WILLOW	I didn't hear her. She wouldn't talk about what happened at the magic shop when she got home last night. She just wanted to know how close I got to tracing the camera signal back to the Empire of the Nerds. And then she left again.
TARA	I'm sure she'll be okay.
WILLOW	I'm not worried about her going up against Warren and the others. I know this is going to sound crazy, but... I think there might be something going on. With Buffy and Spike.
WILLOW	She looked so hurt when she saw him with Anya. I think maybe --
TARA	They've been sleeping together.
WILLOW	I don't know if I'd go that far.
TARA	No, I mean she told me they've been sleeping together.
WILLOW	They're sleeping together? The naked kind of together?
TARA	I'm sorry I didn't say anything. I promised her I wouldn't.
WILLOW	Does everyone else know? Am I the only one she didn't --
TARA	No, god. She didn't even mean to tell me. It just came out.
WILLOW	How could she hide something like that from me?
TARA	I think she was afraid of the look you'd get on your face. Kinda like the one you're wearing now.
WILLOW	No, I'm not -- I'm just trying to understand.
TARA	So is she.
WILLOW	She probably really needs someone to talk to.
TARA	Probably.
TARA	We were kinda busy. Maybe we didn't hear her come home.
WILLOW	Buffy?
DAWN	Is she back yet?
WILLOW	Not yet. But I'm sure she'll be back soon. Everything's fine. Go back to bed.
DAWN	It's ten o'clock.
WILLOW	Oh, umm...
DAWN	You don't think she'd hurt Spike. Do you?
WILLOW	(surprised, hurt) She told you about Spike?
DAWN	It was kinda obvious last night.
WILLOW	(totally not) Yeah, I totally knew.
DAWN	It must have hurt so much. Seeing him and Anya like that. And poor Xander... Everything's so screwed up.
WILLOW	It's gonna be all right. It's just... complicated. When people have such strong feelings for each other, sometimes they --
TARA	Is she back yet -- Oh. Hey.
DAWN	You -- you two -- Oh my god!
DAWN	Oh my god oh my god oh my god!
TARA	Think that's my cue to put some clothes on.
DAWN	No! I'm totally not here. You guys do whatever you want. I'll watch TV. Really loud. In the basement. Where I can't hear. Anything. Oh my god! Oh my god!
DAWN	I love you guys!
BUFFY	(calling them out) All right. Let's make this quick.
BUFFY	Okay. Now that's gonna cost you.
WILLOW	We're here! Ready for action -- uh, bad guy fighting action.
BUFFY	Oh, guys, you didn't have to -- I mean, if you want to be alone --
WILLOW	No, we're good.
TARA	We're better than good.
BUFFY	Great.
WILLOW	(not listening) Super...
DAWN	(to Buffy, overblown) Oh I love you so much!
BUFFY	I love you more!
WILLOW	Okay. We'll stop.
DAWN	You better not.
BUFFY	We're just jealous. True love.
DAWN	Marriage.
BUFFY	Baby carriage.
DAWN	(eyeing Willow and Tara) How does that one work exactly?
TARA	So, em, nerds. How are them? They?
BUFFY	Well. I found their lair, but they must've know we were tracing their signal. They left in hurry -- their van was gone, but everything else was still there.
WILLOW	We should go back. Tara and I could Sherlock around and --
BUFFY	There's nothing left. Giant buzz saws. It was a thing. This was all I could save. I know it's not much, but we need to look for anything that might tell us where they're going, what they're planning.
TARA	Umm, this might take awhile.
BUFFY	Anything we can do to fast forward? We need to find Warren and the others before anyone else gets hurt.
WILLOW	Should we call Xander?
BUFFY	I don't think he's in the Scooby space. Let's give him same time.
DAWN	Maybe they've heard something in the demon bars about those guys. Spike could help find out.
BUFFY	Spike's not -- He's not a part of the group.
DAWN	So he's not going to be around anymore?
BUFFY	I don't know, Dawn. Not for a while.
TARA	What about Anya? She might be able to help with some of the demon texts.
BUFFY	I'm guessing she's not feeling all researchy right now.
ANYA	I know how you feel. Maybe I can help.
BLOND	How could Carl do that to me? That bastard!
ANYA	He's a man. Look no further.
BLOND	But with my sister? She's not even pretty.
ANYA	Well, it's not always about looks. Or a beating heart. Sometimes intimate sweaty relations with the wrong person just seems like a good idea at the time.
BLOND	She's fat! He cheated on me with my fat ugly sister!
ANYA	Likes 'em fleshy, huh? Bet you wish he'd bloat up a couple thousand pounds and pop like a big ol' meat zeppelin, don't ya?
BLOND	He said he loved me!
ANYA	Oh, gee, then I guess he must have meant it, 'cause hey -- guys never say anything they don't really mean, do they?
BLOND	But we --
ANYA	They say, "I love you," and you think it's true.
BLOND	Who's Anya?
ANYA	Then you get all excited with the tingly anticipation, but wait! Not so fast! There's the apocalypse and the back from the grave and the blah blah blah and by the time you're finally standing in that beautifully expensive white dress you've dreamed of wearing ever since you became human, he's gone all heebie-jeebie and decides he'd rather just go steady.
BLOND	Men suck.
ANYA	He keeps saying it's not me, but how can I believe him? He knew he didn't want to get married. Deep down he knew, but he lied to me every day for months.
BLOND	I wish --
ANYA	He lied and lied and then lied a little more, 'cause hey - who's gonna notice with all the other lies flying around like monkeys. And now he thinks he can just sweep the carnage under the rug by saying --
ANDREW	I'm sorry!
JONATHAN	Hit him again! Hit him again!
WARREN	These things are a lot tougher than I thought. One jolt from this should have dropped an elephant --
ANDREW	You want a piece of this? Huh? Oh, not so tough now, are you. Puff 'N Stuff?!
WARREN	Hey. Hey! We need him fresh. Not smoke house.
ANDREW	I'm done being the bait. Next time one of you can wiggle on the hook.
WARREN	If this works, next time we'll be the thing everyone's afraid of.
JONATHAN	Okay, so... What now?
WARREN	Now it's your turn? Sparky.
SPIKE	Doesn't hurt. (re: Dawn's backpack) Not planning a camp out, are we?
DAWN	No. I'm sleeping over at Janice's. Figured Willow and Tara might want some time alone to, um...
SPIKE	The birds are flying again, eh? Ain't love grand.
DAWN	I just wanted to stop by on my way and, you know... Everybody's pretty mad at you.
SPIKE	Yeah. Kinda picked up on that.
DAWN	(soft, disappointed) You're not going to be coming around anymore. Are you?
SPIKE	It's... complicated, nibblet.
DAWN	Everybody keeps saying that.
SPIKE	Must be true then.
DAWN	Was it worth it? What you did with Anya?
SPIKE	Buffy told you?
DAWN	Kinda caught the show. There was a camera somewhere in the magic shop. Warren and Jonathan and that other guy have been watching Buffy.
SPIKE	Wankers.
DAWN	(trying to understand) Do you love her?
SPIKE	No. It was just... a bad day. For both of us. We had a few drinks and things just --
DAWN	Not Anya. Buffy. Do you really love her?
SPIKE	Oh, right. Big Sis was treating me so well up until then. Huh. Must still be a bit of the evil left in me after all.
DAWN	I don't know what happened between you two. But what you did last night... If you wanted to really hurt Buffy -- congratulations. It worked.
WARREN	This is it. We found it.
ANDREW	You sure it's in there?
WARREN	Careful! Only Nezzla demons can pass through the barrier.
WARREN	Just make sure all your skin's covered.
JONATHAN	Why can't I just use a glamor?
ANDREW	You can't Siegfried and Roy the barrier. It's gotta be the real deal.
JONATHAN	Ouhh! It's still wet!
WARREN	Good. Then it should still be fresh enough.
JONATHAN	Should be?! Wait a minute, what do you mean, should be --
WARREN	(pleasantly surprised) Huh. Wasn't sure that was gonna work.
JONATHAN	Jackass.
ANDREW	You think he knows?
WARREN	If he did, he wouldn't be here.
ANDREW	Why is he? Our mojo's tight, bro. We could've pulled this ourselves.
WARREN	(re: barrier) Somebody had to guinea pig the meat suit. Were you going to Volunteer?
ANDREW	I don't trust that leprechaun.
WARREN	Just stay frosty. This works the way we planned it, by the end of the night Jonathan won't be a problem.
JONATHAN	Yeah, I got it.
ANDREW	That's it?
JONATHAN	It'd better be.
ANDREW	Dude, unholy hair gel.
JONATHAN	Get off.
ANDREW	Make me, skin job.
WARREN	Shut up.
ANDREW	They're everything I've dreamed of.
JONATHAN	You know those have been down here for like a zillion years. How do we know they still work --
WARREN	They work.
JONATHAN	You don't look any different.
ANDREW	I thought they were supposed to make us all huge and veiny. Are you sure they're working right?
WARREN	Let's find out.
JONATHAN	(awed and horrified) Mahatma.
WARREN	Welcome to the show, boys.
ANDREW	That was so hot!
JONATHAN	Let me try 'em!
WARREN	Watch the paws, little man.
JONATHAN	We're supposed to share.
WARREN	Relax. You'll each get a whirl... as soon as I'm done playing with 'em.
BUFFY	Hey.
XANDER	Hey.
XANDER	Think there's still a cold one in the fridge. Haven't gotten around to busting the major appliances yet.
BUFFY	Thanks. Still a little early for me.
XANDER	The tyranny of the clock must be overthrown.
BUFFY	So how many coup d' etats is that?
XANDER	General Cirrhosis has seized control of Liver Parliament.
BUFFY	Xander, she loves you. You know that. What Anya did... She was just hurting, Xander. She was hurting and she did this really stupid thing.
XANDER	With your boyfriend.
BUFFY	He's not my boyfriend.
XANDER	I know why Anya did... I understand that. I do. But you...
BUFFY	You don't know how hard it's been.
XANDER	Lying to me?
BUFFY	Being here. After I was brought back... You have no idea how hard it is just being here.
XANDER	You could have told me.
BUFFY	You didn't want to know.
XANDER	So you went to him instead?
BUFFY	What I do with my life is none of your business.
XANDER	(genuinely hurt) It used to be.
BUFFY	It just happened, okay.
XANDER	Oh, like, "Say, you're evil. Get on me."?
BUFFY	Xander, you fought side by side with him when I was gone. You let him take care of Dawn --
XANDER	But I never forgot what he really is. God, what were you thinking?
BUFFY	You're asking me that? Right, 'cause your decision making skills have really sparkled lately.
XANDER	I'm not saying I haven't made mistakes. But the last time I checked slaughtering half of Europe wasn't one of them. He doesn't have a soul, Buffy. Just a leash they jammed in his head. You think he'd still be all snuggles if that chip ever stopped working?
BUFFY	It doesn't matter. I'm not seeing him anymore. It's over.
XANDER	Yeah. Lot of that going around.
TARA	We'll figure it out.
WILLOW	Sure. We'll decipher codes and foil evil schemes and --
TARA	Finally get out of bed?
WILLOW	I was with you up until there.
TARA	What is it?
WILLOW	One of their data CDs. It's filled with encrypted blueprints, schematics...
TARA	To what?
WILLOW	I'm not sure. Their designations have been stripped.
TARA	Maybe we can cross-reference them with the county clerk's office.
WILLOW	Would that involve getting up?
TARA	Eventually.
WILLOW	Then I'm coming out firmly against it.
TARA	What about the Trio's evil scheme?
WILLOW	Kinda busy working on my own...
TARA	Evil's... good.
WOMAN	You're all wet.
XANDER	(wiping hand off) Good thing I'm part fish.
WOMAN	Which part?
XANDER	The one with the hook in it.
WOMAN	Careful. Somebody might reel you in.
XANDER	Yeah, but then there'd be the flopping and the gasping and sure, maybe it'd work out, but chances are I'd up and leave you at the helm in your white dress and they find you spawning with another fish who turns out to be spawning my very good friend night and day behind my back and then comes the fighting and again the flopping and the gasping 'cause hey -- Chicken of the Sea not doing great with the Women these days.
WOMAN	Huh?
XANDER	Sorry. I'm just looking to curl up with the quiet alone tonight.
JONATHAN	(checking watch, nervous) We don't have time for this.
ANDREW	Ease up, twitchy.
WARREN	All right. Let's make some noise.
BUFFY	(exchanging blows) Not bad. How hard you donna hit when you're blowin' in the wind?
BUFFY	Get out.
SPIKE	We need to talk.
BUFFY	I really don't.
SPIKE	This isn't just about you -- as much you'd like it to be.
BUFFY	You spoke. I listened. You leave.
SPIKE	I'm sorry.
I	needed you to know that.
BUFFY	Why?
SPIKE	Because I care about you.
BUFFY	Then you might want to try the not sleeping with my friends.
SPIKE	That's not... I didn't go to Anya for that. I was looking for a spell.
BUFFY	You were going to use a spell on me?
SPIKE	It wasn't for you. I wanted something -- anything to make this feeling stop. I just wanted it to stop. You should have let him kill me.
BUFFY	I couldn't.
SPIKE	Why?
BUFFY	You know why.
SPIKE	Because you love me.
BUFFY	(softly, honestly) No. I don't.
SPIKE	Why do you keep lying to yourself?
BUFFY	I'm not saying I don't have feelings for you. I do. But it's not love. I could never trust you enough for it to become that.
SPIKE	Trust is for old marrieds, Buffy. Great love is wild and passionate and dangerous. It burns and consumes.
BUFFY	Until there's nothing left. That kind of love doesn't last.
SPIKE	I know you feel like I do. You don't have to hide it anymore.
BUFFY	Spike --
SPIKE	Let yourself feel it...
BUFFY	Stop it...
SPIKE	You love me...
BUFFY	Don't --
SPIKE	Let it go... Let yourself love me...
BUFFY	Stop it... please... stop...
SPIKE	(kissing, touching) I know you felt it... When I was inside you...
BUFFY	Don't...
SPIKE	You're going to let me inside you...
BUFFY	Please...
SPIKE	You'll feel it again, Buffy...
BUFFY	Spike, stop...
SPIKE	I'll make you feel it...
BUFFY	STOP!
SPIKE	Oh god. Buffy... I didn't --
BUFFY	Because I stopped you. Something I should have done a long time ago.
JONATHAN	(eyeing crowd) What are we doing here? Somebody might recognize us.
ANDREW	(shutting him down) Warren's the boss.
WARREN	...the clothes, the cars, the money -- that's all just window dressing, baby. This is what's really important...
FRANK	She only comes together with me. Get lost, shrimp.
WARREN	Frankie? Oh my god, is that you?! How long has it been?
FRANK	That was you?
WARREN	Yeah, but hey, no hard feelings. I know you were just fooling around.
FRANK	What'd you say?
WARREN	You heard me, meathead. Take a walk.
FRANK	You're dead, you little --
WARREN	This ain't high school.
WARREN	Don't worry about the tab, ladies.
XANDER	See now, I think it's the daddy thing that's throwing her. 'cause incest -- not that sexy.
JONATHAN	(softly, watching) Aw crap.
XANDER	So why don't we leave the ladies to their impending nausea and move the freakshow outside. Wadaya say?
WARREN	Okay. But can I ask you something first? You think maybe you could put a word in for me with that Anya chick? 'Cause if she's taking it from a vamp, I think I might have a chance --
XANDER	(through the pain) At least I know how to get one.
WARREN	Let's see how popular you are without a face...
JONATHAN	Warren, we have to go.
WARREN	We go when I'm ready.
JONATHAN	Hey, your call.
WARREN	It's your lucky night. Shemp.
ANDREW	We're just gonna leave him?! What if he sics the Slayer on us?
WARREN	Bring her on.
XANDER	Buffy? I found Warren.
XANDER	This what you call not seeing Spike anymore --
BUFFY	He tried. He didn't...
XANDER	Son of a bitch.
BUFFY	Don't.
WILLOW	Hey, I think we finally got something --
BUFFY	Nothing.
WILLOW	We were able to decipher pretty much everything except these.
TARA	It's not written in any ancient language we could identify --
XANDER	It's Klingon. They're love poems -- -- which have nothing to do with the insidious scheme you're about to describe.
BUFFY	What do you got that doesn't rhyme?
TARA	This.
WILLOW	It was filled with encoded blueprints and schematics.
BUFFY	To what?
TARA	Banks, armored car routes, corporate vaults... This is big.
WILLOW	They're looking to score some serious dinero. I don't think they're planning just one job.
XANDER	Spree, anyone?
BUFFY	(eyeing printouts) I can't cover all of these at once.
WILLOW	You don't have to. There's one here we think they'll hit tonight.
TARA	It's time sensitive.
XANDER	Be careful. Warren's gone all Mighty Mouse. Emphasis on the might.
BUFFY	Good. I won't have to hold back.
CLEM	I was just in the neighborhood and I thought, you know, there's a Nightrider marathon on the TV, so, uh...
SPIKE	What have I done? Why didn't I do it? What has she done to me?
CLEM	She-done who?
SPIKE	We were never together. Not really. She wouldn't lower herself that far.
CLEM	She's a sweet girl, Spike, but hey. Issues . And no wonder, with the coming back from the grave and whatnot. I had this cousin, got resurrected by some kooky shaman -- who-boy! Was that a mess!
SPIKE	Why do I feel this way?
CLEM	Love's a funny thing.
SPIKE	Is that what this is?
CLEM	Well, I don't know. Drinking, breaking stuff -- how's your appetite? You been eating?
SPIKE	I can feel it. Squirming inside my head.
CLEM	Love?
SPIKE	The chip. Little Jiminy Cricket, gnawing bits and chunks.
CLEM	(re: Spike's head) Maybe a wet cloth...?
SPIKE	Everything used to be so clear. Slayer. Vampire. Vampire kills Slayer, sucks her dry, picks his teeth with her bones.
CLEM	Metaphorically?
SPIKE	That's how it's always been. I've tasted the life of two Slayers. But with Buffy... This isn't the way it's supposed to be. It's the chip. Steel and wires and silicon. It won't let me be a monster. And I can't be a man. I'm nothing.
CLEM	Hey. Come on now, Mr. Negative. You never know what's just around the corner. Things change.
SPIKE	They do. (a beat) If you make them.
CLEM	There you go! Bright side! Chin up!
SPIKE	She thinks she knows me. She thinks she knows who I am. What I'm capable of. She has no idea. I wasn't always this way. It won't be easy, but I can be like I was. Before they castrated me. Before... Then she'll see who I really am.
CLEM	Now you're talking!
ADMINISTRATOR	(signing form) Always the biggest gate of the year. (handing clipboard back) Don't lose any.
ANDREW	Man, I can't wait to get my hands on his orbs.
JONATHAN	Yeah. I'm sure he'll be giving 'em up any second.
BUFFY	'Cause if not, there's gonna be a fee for that.
WARREN	I was wondering when Super Bitch would show up.
BUFFY	You really got a problem with strong women, don't you?
WARREN	Nothing I can't handle.
BUFFY	It's getting better.
WARREN	That all you got?
ANDREW	(guts ripped out) No!
BUFFY	There's two ways this can end. And right about now I'm thinking they're both gonna hurt.
ANDREW	I think you're right.
WARREN	What's the matter baby? Never fight a real man before.
WARREN	Wow. That almost hurt, kitten.
ANDREW	(egging Warren on) Kill her! Kill her!
WARREN	You know who I am?
BUFFY	You're a murderer.
WARREN	That too. But more to the point --
BUFFY	I'll remember that when I knock 'em clean out of your --
WARREN	Whoa, Sparky! Didn't think you had it in you.
JONATHAN	(hissing in her ear) The orbs! Smash his orbs --
WARREN	Say good night, bitch.
BUFFY	Good night, bitch.
WARREN	Get away from me!
BUFFY	Oh come on.
ANDREW	Well played, Slayer!
JONATHAN	Why didn't I get one of those?!
ANDREW	This round to you. But the game is far from over.
JONATHAN	Jet packs. You jerks were setting me up to take the fall.
ANDREW	He left me. He flew away and left me.
JONATHAN	Oh god. The Big House.
AUDREW	How could he do that to me? He promised we'd be together. He was just using me. He never really loved -- -- hanging out with us.
I	mean, he wouldn't just take off. Would he?
SPIKE	Get nice and comfy Slayer. I'll be back. And when I do... it's all gonna change.
WILLOW	Hey. Clothes.
TARA	Don't get too used to them.
WILLOW	Yes, ma'am.
TARA	Mmmm... Xander.
WILLOW	Okay, not quite the response I was fishing for.
TARA	No, he's here.
WILLOW	Think they're making up?
TARA	I hope so.
XANDER	Time for the Spring Poking already?
BUFFY	Just making sure there's no more Evil Trio cameras. Or Evil Uno.
XANDER	The sinister yet addictive card game?
BUFFY	Warren. Jonathan and Andrew got klinked, but Warren pulled a Rocket Man. It was a thing.
XANDER	You'll find him. He won't be much good without his friends.
BUFFY	No. He won't.
XANDER	How did we get here?
BUFFY	Scenic route. Long drive.
XANDER	These last few weeks...
BUFFY	I know.
XANDER	I thought I hit bottom, but... It hurt. That you didn't trust me enough to tell me about Spike. It hurt.
BUFFY	I'm sorry. I should have told you.
XANDER	Maybe you would have. If I hadn't given you so many reasons to think I'd be an ass about it.
BUFFY	Guess we've both done a lot of things lately we're not proud of.
XANDER	Think I got you beat.
BUFFY	Wanna compare?
XANDER	Not so much.
BUFFY	Let's not find out.
XANDER	Buffy --
WARREN	You think you can just do that to me? That I'd let you get away with it? Think again --
XANDER	Sweet fancy Moses! Where the hell did he get --
TARA	Your shirt...
WILLOW	Tara?

BUFFY	You don't like the color.
GILES	I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you ignore everything I say? As a rule?
BUFFY	No, I believe that's your trick. I told you I'm going out for the cheerleading squad.
GILES	You have a sacred birthright, Buffy. You have been chosen to destroy Vampires, not wave pom-poms at people. As the Watcher, I forbid it.
BUFFY	And you'll be stopping me how?
GILES	Dyeh, uh, well -- by appealling to your common sense, if such a creature exists.
BUFFY	I'll still have time to fight the forces of evil, okay? But I want to have a life. I want to do something normal. Something safe.
WILLOW	Giles didn't approve, huh?
BUFFY	He totally lost his water. We haven't even seen a vampire in a week. I'd say he should get a girlfriend if he wasn't so old.
WILLOW	Well, we're behind you.
XANDER	People scoff at things like school spirit -- but when you see these young women giving their all like this...
XANDER	...Oooh, stretchy. Where was I?
WILLOW	You were pretending that seeing scantily-clad girls in revealing postures was a spiritual experience.
XANDER	What do you mean, pretending?
XANDER	Oh, hey. Here's a little good luck thing for the tryouts...
BUFFY	What is this?
WILLOW	What is that?
BUFFY	This is so sweet! "Yours always..."
XANDER	That was on there when I got it. Really. They all said that.
CORDELIA	Just look at Amber. Who does she think she is, a Laker Girl?
WILLOW	I heard she turned them down.
CHEERLEADER	Let's begin with... (reads from list) Amber Grove. If you're not auditioning move off the floor.
WILLOW	Hi Amy.
AMY	Hi.
WILLOW	I didn't know you wanted to be a cheerleader. You lost a lot of weight.
AMY	Had to.
WILLOW	Do you know Buffy?
AMY	Hi. Oh how I hate this, let me count the ways.
AMY	She trained with Benson -- he's the best coach money can buy.
BUFFY	They have cheerleading coaches?
AMY	Oh yeah. You don't have...? I train with my mom, three hours in the morning, three at night.
BUFFY	That kind of quality time with my mom would probably lead to some quality matricide.
AMY	I know it's kinda hokey... but she's really great.
BUFFY	What the ... ?
WILLOW	That girl's on fire.
CORDELIA	Enough with the hyperbole.
BUFFY	It's okay, you're gonna be okay...
BUFFY	I've been slaying Vampires for more than a year now. I've seen some pretty cringeworthy stuff, but nobody's hands ever got toasted.
GILES	I imagine not.
BUFFY	So this is not a vampire problem.
GILES	No.
BUFFY	But it is funky , right? Not of the norm?
GILES	Quite. Spontaneous human combustion is rare, and scientifically unexplainable. But there've been cases reported for hundreds of years. Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes.
WILLOW	That's all that would have been left of Amber if it hadn't been for Buffy.
XANDER	So we have no idea what caused this? That's a comfort.
GILES	Well, that is the thrill of living on a hellmouth -- one has a veritable cornucopia of fiends, devils and ghouls to engage -- Pardon me for finding the glass half full.
BUFFY	Any common denominator in cases of spontaneous combustion?
GILES	Rage. In most cases the person who combusted was terribly angry or upset.
XANDER	So maybe Amber's got this power. To make herself be on fire. Like the Human Torch, only it hurts.
BUFFY	So I should get the skinny on Amber. See if she's had any colorful episodes before.
WILLOW	That means hacking illegally into the school's computer system -- at last something I can do.
XANDER	I'll ask around about her.
BUFFY	Guys, you don't have to get involved.
XANDER	What do you mean? We're a team! Aren't we a team?
WILLOW	Yeah, you're the Slayer and we're like the slayerettes.
BUFFY	I don't want you putting yourselves in danger.
XANDER	I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide till it goes away.
BUFFY	Okay, well, I'm psyched for the help. And what if we find out Amber didn't cause this herself?
GILES	Then we will have to determine who or what did. And deal with it accordingly.
XANDER	Hey, we've fought vampires! Anything else'll be a walk in the park.
BUFFY	I hope so...
BUFFY	Hey, Mom.
JOYCE	Hi. How was school?
BUFFY	A reverent joy. What's all this?
JOYCE	It's for the tribal art display.
BUFFY	Oh. Cool.
BUFFY	We had tryouts today.
JOYCE	Great! How'd it go?
BUFFY	Well, I didn't get to try out yet. There was an accident. Pretty fierce competition, though.
JOYCE	I know you'll do fine. Keep on plugging. Just have to get back on the horse.
BUFFY	Mom?
JOYCE	Yeah?
BUFFY	What was I trying out for?
JOYCE	Um... some activity? I have no idea, I'm sorry.
BUFFY	That's okay. Your platitudes are good for all occasions.
JOYCE	I'm distracted. I've got a lot of inventory to go through here. This is my gallery's first major show.
JOYCE	It might not physically kill you to give me a hand...
BUFFY	It was cheerleading tryouts.
JOYCE	Oh! Good. I'm glad you're taking that up again. Keep you out of trouble.
BUFFY	I'm not in trouble, mom.
JOYCE	No, not yet. I mean -- you stopped cheerleading right before the trouble. So it's good you're going back --
JOYCE	Oh, dear.
BUFFY	What is it?
JOYCE	Fertility statue. You don't need to see it.
BUFFY	You know, this girl Amy trains with her mom like three hours a day. Sounds like her mom's really into it.
JOYCE	Sounds like her mom doesn't have a whole lot to do.
BUFFY	Jeepers.
CHEERLEADER	...we still have to pick new cheerleaders. If you make the team, you'll find your name posted in the Quad after lunch. Let's begin with group performance -- Cordelia, Buffy, Amy, Morgan, Janice and Lishanne.
AMY	Why do my hands have to sweat when I get nervous?
BUFFY	Don't worry, you'll do great.
LISHANNE	We're Sunnydale, Sunnydale
CHEER	We Never Fail, Never Fail
LISHANNE	Jump and Shoot, Swish and Score
CHEER	The Other Team Is Such a Bore YEAHHH!
CORDELIA	You saw that, right? That wasn't me.
AMY	That's my mom.
BUFFY	No... Catherine Madison. Get down with your bad self.
AMY	Her nickname was Catherine The Great: she took that team and made them tri-county champions, no one's ever done that before or since. She and my dad were homecoming King and Queen, got married right after graduation.
BUFFY	That's kinda romantic.
AMY	Well... he was a big loser, couldn't make any money, took off with Miss Trailer Trash when I was twelve.
BUFFY	Okay, that part's less romantic. My folks split up, too.
AMY	Drag, huh. He left my mom with nothing. She put herself through cosmetology school, bought me everything I ever wanted and never gained a single pound...
BUFFY	She sounds great, Amy, but that doesn't mean you have to, you know, lock step as far as the cheerleading thing --
AMY	It's just, she was the best, and I can't get my body to move like hers. I choked in there so bad.
AMY	...I gotta get changed...
WILLOW	Hi Amy... She okay?
BUFFY	She's wiggin' about her mother... ...the big cheer queen back when.
WILLOW	Yeah. Her mom's kinda...
BUFFY	Nazi-like?
WILLOW	Heil. If she gains an ounce she padlocks the fridge and won't eat anything but broth.
BUFFY	So Mommie Dearest is really... Mommie Dearest.
WILLOW	There's a bitter streak -- but Amy's nice. We used to hang in Junior High. When her mom'd go on a broth kick Amy'd come to my house and we'd just stuff ourselves with brownies.
BUFFY	Any word on Amber?
WILLOW	Nothing thrilling. Average student -- got detention once for smoking -- regular smoking, with a cigarette. Not being smoky. All pretty normal.
BUFFY	We'll just have to see what happens next. Maybe nothing will.
CORDELIA	I have a dream. It's me on the Cheerleading Squad, adored by every Varsity male as far as the eye can see. We have to achieve our dreams, Amy, otherwise we wither and die.
AMY	Look, I'm sorry about --
CORDELIA	Shhh. If your supreme klutziness out there today takes me out of the running you are going to be so very beyond sorry. Have a nice day.
WILLOW	I told Buffy about Amber.
XANDER	Cool. Was she wearing it? The bracelet. She was wearing it, right? That's pretty much like we're going out.
WILLOW	Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.
XANDER	So now I'm a figure of fun. I should just ask, right?
WILLOW	Won't know till you ask.
XANDER	See, this is why you're cool. You're like a guy. You're my guy friend that knows about girl stuff.
WILLOW	Oh great. I'm a guy.
XANDER	Hey, they're posting the list!
LISHANNE	Yess!
AMY	I can't take this...
XANDER	Spot me, I'm goin' in.
XANDER	Women and children first.
CORDELIA	You're lucky.
AMY	I made it?
CORDELIA	I made it.
XANDER	One of those girls hit me really hard -- we have to start testing for steroids -- -- okay, not only did you make it, but you, Miss Summers, are the number one alternate and Amy's the number three!
XANDER	Any what better way to celebrate than with a romantic drive-through for two at --
WILLOW	Xander, alternates are the ones who didn't make the team. They only fill in if something happens to the ones who did.
BUFFY	Excuse me.
XANDER	For I am Xander, King of the Cretins, and all lesser cretins must bow before me.
BUFFY	At least it's over. And you know what I think we should do about it? Brownie pig-out, my house, now.
AMY	How many more hours a day can I practice? How much more can I do? This would never have happened to my mom. Never.
WITCH	...Lord of Darkness, Lord of Night... accept they supplicant's sacrifice...
WITCH	...reap thy vengeance with keen and cruel might... send thy sudden darkness out of darkest night.
JOYCE	Look what I found! It's my old yearbook, from junior year. Oh, look, there I am.
BUFFY	Mom, I accepted that you've had sex. I'm not ready to know you've had Farrah hair.
JOYCE	This is Gidget hair. Don't they teach you anything in history?
BUFFY	That's cool. I gotta book --
JOYCE	Well I was thinking, I mean I know the cheerleading thing didn't work out. Maybe you should think about joining the yearbook staff. I did it, and it was a lot of fun.
BUFFY	Not really my tip, mom.
JOYCE	I was photo editor. I got to be on every page. Made me look much more popular than I was.
BUFFY	Have you seen the kids who do yearbook, mom? Nerds pick on them.
JOYCE	Some of the best times I had in school were working on the yearbook.
BUFFY	This just in: I'm not you. I'm into my own thing.
JOYCE	Your own thing, whatever it is, got you kicked out of school. And we had to move here to find a decent school that would take you.
JOYCE	Honey...
JOYCE	Great parenting form. Little shaky on the dismount...
XANDER	Morning your Highness, beheadings at noon as usual? (to Willow, re: Cordelia's departing back). Okay, see how she has now clue I'm even a mammal, much less a human being?
WILLOW	None.
XANDER	This invisible man syndrome, a blessing in Cordelia's case, a curse in Buffy's.
WILLOW	You're not invisible to Buffy.
XANDER	Worse, I'm just part of the scenery, like an old shoe, or a rug you walk on every day but you never really see --
WILLOW	-- like a pen that's all chewed up and you know you should throw it away but you don't, not 'cause you really like it that much but more 'cause you're just so used to it and --
XANDER	Will. That is the point and let's not drive it through my head like a railroad spike. What I have do -- what I'm going to do -- is just what you said --
WILLOW	Throw away the pen, forget about Buffy. (tosses pen in trash)
XANDER	What I have to do -- what I'm going to do -- is be a man and ask her out. No more i.d. bracelets, subtle innuendo, or Polaroids outside her bedroom window late at night -- that last is a joke to relieve the tension because here she comes .
WILLOW	I know I'm relieved.
XANDER	Alright. Into battle I go. would you ask her out for me? No. Man. Me. Battle.
XANDER	Buffy, how would you like to...
BUFFY	Is that even Cordelia's locker?
XANDER	Huh? I don't know, what I'm saying here is, accompany me Friday night...
BUFFY	Hang on, Xander, I have to... we can pick this up later, you don't mind, do you?
XANDER	Pplllewww!
POLE	Nice of you to join us Cordelia. We didn't keep you waiting or anything did we? It's your turn to drive. Let's buckle up, people.
CORDELIA	I don't want to drive today, Mr. Pole.
POLE	You've flunked Driver's Ed twice - show me some moves or you'll be taking the bus to college.
POLE	Check your brake, your mirrors, start the engine, put the car in drive...
POLE	...let' move forward and through the cones in a gentle, even turn to the --
POLE	-- brakes!
POLE	Slow down, turn right, right, BRAKES, BRAKES!!
POLE	Everyone out!
CORDELIA	
CORDELIA	What's happening?!? I can't see anything!
BUFFY	Cordelia, it's okay, you're gonna be -- Oh, god...
CORDELIA	What's happening to me!?!
GILES	Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy to disable and disorient them is a classic.
XANDER	First vampires, now witches... no wonder you can still afford a house in Sunnydale.
GILES	Why would someone want to harm Cordelia?
WILLOW	Maybe because... they met her. Did I say that?
GILES	Then why was Amber set ablaze?
XANDER	Yeah, those guys don't hang.
BUFFY	They're both cheerleaders.
GILES	Someone doesn't like cheerleading.
BUFFY	Or likes it too much.
WILLOW	Amy.
BUFFY	Amy.
XANDER	So you guys are leaning towards Amy.
BUFFY	She's desperate to get on that team... I get the feeling she'd do anything to make her mom's dream come true.
GILES	Now I do want to make sure I've got this right. This witch is casting horrible, disfiguring spells so that she can be a cheerleader.
BUFFY	Your point being?
GILES	Priorities. Really, if I had the power of the black mass I'd set my sights a little higher than making the pep squad.
BUFFY	I think you're underestimating the amount of pressure a parent can lay on you. If you're not a picture perfect carbon copy they tend to wig.
WILLOW	Cheerleading was kind of her mom's last hurrah.
XANDER	We still gotta stop Amy. We should grab her before --
GILES	Let's be certain she's the witch before we arouse her suspicions. She's capable of some fairly ugly things.
BUFFY	All right, you're a high school girl, you're desperate to make the team and please your mom, you turn to witchcraft. What's the first thing you do?
WILLOW	check out the books on witchcraft!
XANDER	That's the last thing you do! You don't leave a paper trail. Forget that --
WILLOW	It'll just take a minute --
XANDER	We don't have a minute. Cheerleaders' lives are in danger -- Buffy's in danger. (grabs Buffy, tries to hustle her out) You were the first alternate. You're on the team now that Cordelia's out -- you could be next, we have to get you to a safe house.
WILLOW	Xander ...
XANDER	Yes?
WILLOW	"Witches - Historic Roots to Modern Practice" checked out by Alexander Harris.
BUFFY	"The Pagan Rites", checked out by Alexander --
XANDER	All right, all right. It's not what you think.
WILLOW	You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?
XANDER	Oh. Well, then it is what you think.
GILES	We'll need a conclusive test anyway. There should be one - yes! The ducking stool. We throw her in the pond. If she floats, she's a witch; if she drowns, she's innocent. (off their looks) ... some of my texts are a bit outdated.
BUFFY	You think?
GILES	Ah! Yes. This should work. You'll need some of her hair, a little quicksilver and aqua fortis.
WILLOW	That's just mercury and nitric acid, we can get it in the science lab.
GILES	"Heat ingredients and apply to witch, if a spell has been cast in previous forty-eight hours witch's skin will turn blue." Oh, and you'll need some eye of newt.
GREGORY	Those on track one may begin their dissections. Those on track two, add your hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide to your beakers...
XANDER	I can't.
WILLOW	One eye of newt...
XANDER	Wow, you've got a killer streak I've never seen before. Hope I never cross you.
WILLOW	I do too, then I'd have to carve you up in neat little pieces.
XANDER	Ha ha. How's Buffy coming with the hair?
LISHANNE	Isn't this exciting?
BUFFY	Oh yeah.
BUFFY	Help. Which is the hydrochloric acid and which is the ammonium hydroxide?
AMY	Well, the bottle that says hydrochloric acid is usually the hydrochloric acid.
BUFFY	Read the bottles -- what a concept.
XANDER	Smile and wave to the nice witch.
WILLOW	All set. You have a plan?
BUFFY	Spill it on her, try and make it look natural.
XANDER	We'll be right behind you. Only farther away.
GREGORY	Lishanne, can you tell me why these chemicals have this reaction?
GREGORY	Lishanne? Are you -- Oh my god.
XANDER	Did you see? Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.
WILLOW	So it's not her?
BUFFY	The test was positive. She's our Sabrina. I just don't think she realizes what she's doing.
WILLOW	Should we talk to her?
BUFFY	Maybe we should talk to her mother . I wonder if she knows what she's created.
AMY	Where are you?!
AMY	Another productive day in front of the T.V. I got a history report due tomorrow. Write it.
AMY	I should be on that team by now. Instead, Miss Buffy and friends are sneaking around stealing bits of my hair.
AMY	I'll be upstairs.
BUFFY	Oops.
BUFFY	MACHO MACHO MAN... Hey, juice.
BUFFY	Quality juice. Not from concentrate.
JOYCE	You're in a good mood.
BUFFY	I am. I'm on the squad. Which is great because I feel like cheering. And leading others to cheer. Hey, juice!
JOYCE	Listen honey, about yesterday...
BUFFY	That's totally yester. Besides, it's not like you were wrong. I did get kicked out. I'm wacky that way.
JOYCE	Still, I want you to know that despite the problems you've had --
BUFFY	Mom, you don't get it. Believe me, you don't want it. There's just things about being a vampire slayer that the older generation has a problem with.
JOYCE	A what?
BUFFY	Long story. I mean I'm kidding.
JOYCE	Buffy, are you feeling well?
BUFFY	I can't be in a good mood? That's a new house rule? Fine, I don't mind, cuz I'm a MACHO MACHO MAN...
CHEERLEADER	Ow! Get it together, Buffy, we have a game in less than four hours.
BUFFY	Hey Willow, Xander! My buds are here. I love my buds.
XANDER	Is it me, or is Buffy somewhat looped?
WILLOW	We better get her out of there.
XANDER	Yeah, before she...
XANDER	....hurts somebody.
BUFFY	Did I do that?
CHEERLEADER	You are so out of here!
WILLOW	It's not her fault --
XANDER	She's on medication --
CHEERLEADER	Obviously not enough. Who's our next alternate -- oh.
CHEERLEADER	Amy, you just made cheerleader.
BUFFY	No no no, you don't want her, she's a wi--
XANDER	A wise choice indeed.
BUFFY	She's a witchy!!
WILLOW	Buffy --
BUFFY	I just got kicked off the team, didn't I?
XANDER	I don't think it's your fault.
BUFFY	I know you don't. That's cause you're my friend. You're my Xander-shaped friend. ...do you have any idea why I love you so, Xander?
WILLOW	We gotta get you to --
XANDER	Let her speak!
BUFFY	I'll tell you. You're not like other guys at all...
XANDER	Well...
BUFFY	You are completely and totally one of the girls. I'm that comfy with you.
XANDER	That's great.
BUFFY	Any other guy gave me a bracelet, they'd want to date me, it'd be a thing, but you -- you --
BUFFY	Oh. I don't feel so good.
WILLOW	Buffy?
BUFFY	Something is really... not good...
WILLOW	We gotta get her to a hospital.
GILES	They can't help her. This is a Bloodstone Vengeance Spell, hits the body hard, like drinking a quart of alcohol, then eradicates the immune system.
XANDER	Vengeance spell. Like she's getting even with Buffy?
BUFFY	'Cause she knows I know she's a witch.
GILES	The others she just wanted out of the running, you she intends to...
BUFFY	Kill.
WILLOW	How much time do we have?
GILES	I'm sure we have --
BUFFY	Truth please.
GILES	Couple of hours, three at most.
XANDER	So how do we reverse Buffy's spell?
GILES	I've been researching that. We can reverse all the spells if we can get our hands on Amy's spell book --
WILLOW	And if we can't get our hands on it?
GILES	The only other way is to cut the witch's head off.
XANDER	Show of hands...
BUFFY	No. It's not Amy's fault. She became a witch to survive her mother.
XANDER	I don't care why, I care that you go on breathing.
BUFFY	Giles, where would she be casting these spells?
GILES	She needs a sacred space with a pentagram, a large pot...
BUFFY	At home. Help me get up. We'll go to her house, find her book --
WILLOW	We'll go with you.
BUFFY	No. Stay here, keep an eye on Amy.
GILES	And keep her away from the science lab. We'll need it to cast our counter spells.
CATHERINE	What do you want? Is there something wrong?
GILES	Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to you about your daughter.
CATHERINE	I'm not allowed to -- you'll have to come back.
GILES	Your daughter is up to something very dangerous. Are you aware of that?
CATHERINE	I don't know what you're talking about.
GILES	I think you know very well.
CATHERINE	You have to go. She's gonna be home soon.
GILES	This girl is very sick. You will shut up and you will listen to me. You daughter has access to some very powerful magics. Somehow your obsession with cheerleading has made her --
CATHERINE	I don't care about cheerleading! It's not my fault she's doing stuff.
GILES	As her mother, you should accept some responsibility for her actions.
CATHERINE	Well, these kids today...
CATHERINE	She's out of her mind. Ever since control her.
GILES	You're afraid of her.
BUFFY	Amy?
BUFFY	Are you Amy?
GILES	I don't understand...
BUFFY	She switched, didn't she? She switched your bodies. She wanted to relive her glory days. Catherine the Great.
GILES	Good lord...
CATHERINE	She said I was wasting my youth... So she took it.
CATHERINE	I didn't know about her... her power. When my dad was here they would fight, he called her a witch. I thought he meant something else. When he left I wanted to go with him but she wouldn't even let me call. She got crazy. She'd lock herself upstairs for days. And she'd get down on me all the time. She said I didn't deserve to have it so easy, that I didn't know how hard it was to be her. I guess she showed me, huh?
BUFFY	Amy, it's gonna be okay.
CATHERINE	A few months ago I woke up in her bed, I didn't know where I was... and I looked in the mirror...
GILES	She locked herself upstairs. Where?
CATHERINE	She has a room in the attic.
GILES	Show me.
CATHERINE	If she finds out I've been in here she'll kill me.
GILES	My God...
GILES	I believe we can reverse your mother's spell. All of them, in fact.
CATHERINE	You really could?
GILES	Yes, but I need her books. There are certain volumes she would need for this kind of casting.
GILES	Collect those dolls, and all the personal --
GILES	Nice kitty... What were you guarding? Yes...
GILES	This is it.
BUFFY	Did we find?
GILES	We found.
CATHERINE	Where are you going?
GILES	We're going to school. And you're coming with us.
GILES	I'm going to stop this.
GILES	I promise. Just hang on.
CATHERINE	How is she?
GILES	We only have a few minutes.
GILES	Let's see... I'll need lead, sulphur, some sort of diacetate...
CATHERINE	What should I do?
GILES	Find me a frog.
GILES	Right.
GILES	The center is dark. (in Latin) centrum est obscurus . The darkness breathes. tenebrae respiratis . The listener hears.
GILES	Hear me.
CATHERINE	It's working...
GILES	Unlock the gate, let the darkness shine. Cover us with holy fear. Show me.
CHEERLEADER	Amy, what's your problem?
WILLOW	She must be heading for Buffy!
XANDER	Come on.
CATHERINE	She's heading this way.
WILLOW	Amy!
AMY	Get out of my way!
WILLOW	Wait! I needed to talk to you. I can help you.
AMY	Help me? With what?
WILLOW	Well, you know, all your... witchcraft. I know a really good... cauldron... do you actually ride a broom or --
WILLOW	Xander!
GILES	Corsheth, and Gilail, the gate is closed. Receive the dark, release the unworthy... Take of mine energy and be sated!
GILES	Be sated! Release the unworthy!
GILES	Release!
GILES	Release!
GILES	RELEASE!
BUFFY	Amy?
CATHERINE	You. You little brat.
AMY	Mom, please...
CATHERINE	Raise a hand to your own mother? Who gave you birth, who gave up her life, her LIFE so you could drag your worthless carcass around and call it living?
CATHERINE	You were never anything but trouble. I'll put you where you'll never make trouble again.
BUFFY	Hey, guess what?
BUFFY	I feel better.
CATHERINE	That body was mine! Mine!
BUFFY	Oh, grow up.
CATHERINE	I shall look upon my enemy --
CATHERINE	-- I shall look upon her and the dark place will have her soul! Corsheth! Take her!
GILES	Well, that was interesting.
BUFFY	Are you guys okay?
AMY	I'm fine.
GILES	I think all the spells were reversed. Of course, it's my first casting, I may have got it wrong.
BUFFY	You save my life. You were a god.
GILES	One doesn't want to be immodest, but I am not unsatisfied --
BUFFY	Giles, stop being so proper. You're in America. Brag.
GILES	Well, it was the first time and some of those incantations are quite tricky. And I was somewhat interpretive with the ingredients --
XANDER	I got her! I got her! Cut her head off!
BUFFY	Xander, what are you doing?
XANDER	Saving you.
XANDER	But she's evil!
GILES	Well, it wasn't exactly her.
AMY	It was my mom.
XANDER	Oh.
WILLOW	Where is she?
XANDER	Willow! It's cool.
WILLOW	It is?
XANDER	Oh yeah. I took care of it.
JOYCE	I don't get it.
BUFFY	What?
JOYCE	I've been thinking a lot about where you're coming from, how to relate to you, and I've come to a simple conclusion. I don't get it. What you want, what you're thinking. Not a clue.
BUFFY	I'm inscrutable, huh?
JOYCE	You're sixteen. I think there's a biological imperative whereby I can't understand you because I'm not sixteen.
BUFFY	Do you ever wish you could be? Sixteen again?
JOYCE	There's a frightful notion. Go through all that again. No even if it helped me understand you.
BUFFY	I love you, mom.
JOYCE	I don't get it.
AMY	Dad is so impossible. He doesn't ever want me going anywhere, wants to spend total quality time together. I'm like, "Dad, I can go out, it's perfectly safe." He's got all this guilt at leaving me with mom and he's being a total pain.
BUFFY	You're loving it.
AMY	Every single minute.
CORDELIA	Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got bumped back to alternate. Hold it -- wait -- no I'm not.
AMY	Well, I know I'll miss the intellectual thrill of spelling words out with my arms.
CORDELIA	Ooh, these grapes are sour.
AMY	Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you actually wanted to be on the squad.
BUFFY	No, that's okay. Cheerleading is just a little too hairy these days.
AMY	That's for sure.
AMY	Catherine the Great.
BUFFY	And there's been no sign of her?
AMY	That last spell, she said I'd never make trouble again. Wherever she is, I don't think we have to worry.
BUFFY	Twisted.
AMY	I'm just happy to have my body back. (as they walk off) I'm thinking of getting fat.
BUFFY	Well, that look is in for spring.
BUFFY	You don't like the color.
GILES	I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you ignore everything I say? As a rule?
BUFFY	No, I believe that's your trick. I told you I'm going out for the cheerleading squad.
GILES	You have a sacred birthright, Buffy. You have been chosen to destroy Vampires, not wave pom-poms at people. As the Watcher, I forbid it.
BUFFY	And you'll be stopping me how?
GILES	Dyeh, uh, well -- by appealling to your common sense, if such a creature exists.
BUFFY	I'll still have time to fight the forces of evil, okay? But I want to have a life. I want to do something normal. Something safe.
WILLOW	Giles didn't approve, huh?
BUFFY	He totally lost his water. We haven't even seen a vampire in a week. I'd say he should get a girlfriend if he wasn't so old.
WILLOW	Well, we're behind you.
XANDER	People scoff at things like school spirit -- but when you see these young women giving their all like this...
XANDER	...Oooh, stretchy. Where was I?
WILLOW	You were pretending that seeing scantily-clad girls in revealing postures was a spiritual experience.
XANDER	What do you mean, pretending?
XANDER	Oh, hey. Here's a little good luck thing for the tryouts...
BUFFY	What is this?
WILLOW	What is that?
BUFFY	This is so sweet! "Yours always..."
XANDER	That was on there when I got it. Really. They all said that.
CORDELIA	Just look at Amber. Who does she think she is, a Laker Girl?
WILLOW	I heard she turned them down.
WILLOW	Hi Amy.
AMY	Hi.
WILLOW	I didn't know you wanted to be a cheerleader. You lost a lot of weight.
AMY	Had to.
WILLOW	Do you know Buffy?
AMY	Hi. Oh how I hate this, let me count the ways.
AMY	She trained with Benson -- he's the best coach money can buy.
BUFFY	They have cheerleading coaches?
AMY	Oh yeah. You don't have...? I train with my mom, three hours in the morning, three at night.
BUFFY	That kind of quality time with my mom would probably lead to some quality matricide.
AMY	I know it's kinda hokey... but she's really great.
BUFFY	What the ... ?
WILLOW	That girl's on fire.
CORDELIA	Enough with the hyperbole.
BUFFY	I've been slaying Vampires for more than a year now. I've seen some pretty cringeworthy stuff, but nobody's hands ever got toasted.
GILES	I imagine not.
BUFFY	So this is not a vampire problem.
GILES	No.
BUFFY	But it is funky , right? Not of the norm?
GILES	Quite. Spontaneous human combustion is rare, and scientifically unexplainable. But there've been cases reported for hundreds of years. Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes.
WILLOW	That's all that would have been left of Amber if it hadn't been for Buffy.
XANDER	So we have no idea what caused this? That's a comfort.
GILES	Well, that is the thrill of living on a hellmouth -- one has a veritable cornucopia of fiends, devils and ghouls to engage -- Pardon me for finding the glass half full.
BUFFY	Any common denominator in cases of spontaneous combustion?
GILES	Rage. In most cases the person who combusted was terribly angry or upset.
XANDER	So maybe Amber's got this power. To make herself be on fire. Like the Human Torch, only it hurts.
BUFFY	So I should get the skinny on Amber. See if she's had any colorful episodes before.
WILLOW	That means hacking illegally into the school's computer system -- at last something I can do.
XANDER	I'll ask around about her.
BUFFY	Guys, you don't have to get involved.
XANDER	What do you mean? We're a team! Aren't we a team?
WILLOW	Yeah, you're the Slayer and we're like the slayerettes.
BUFFY	I don't want you putting yourselves in danger.
XANDER	I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide till it goes away.
BUFFY	Okay, well, I'm psyched for the help. And what if we find out Amber didn't cause this herself?
GILES	Then we will have to determine who or what did. And deal with it accordingly.
XANDER	Hey, we've fought vampires! Anything else'll be a walk in the park.
BUFFY	I hope so...
BUFFY	Hey, Mom.
JOYCE	Hi. How was school?
BUFFY	A reverent joy. What's all this?
JOYCE	It's for the tribal art display.
BUFFY	We had tryouts today.
JOYCE	Great! How'd it go?
BUFFY	Well, I didn't get to try out yet. There was an accident. Pretty fierce competition, though.
JOYCE	I know you'll do fine. Keep on plugging. Just have to get back on the horse.
BUFFY	Mom?
JOYCE	Yeah?
BUFFY	What was I trying out for?
JOYCE	Um... some activity? I have no idea, I'm sorry.
BUFFY	That's okay. Your platitudes are good for all occasions.
JOYCE	I'm distracted. I've got a lot of inventory to go through here. This is my gallery's first major show.
BUFFY	It was cheerleading tryouts.
JOYCE	Oh! Good. I'm glad you're taking that up again. Keep you out of trouble.
BUFFY	I'm not in trouble, mom.
JOYCE	No, not yet. I mean -- you stopped cheerleading right before the trouble. So it's good you're going back --
BUFFY	What is it?
JOYCE	Fertility statue. You don't need to see it.
BUFFY	You know, this girl Amy trains with her mom like three hours a day. Sounds like her mom's really into it.
JOYCE	Sounds like her mom doesn't have a whole lot to do.
AMY	Why do my hands have to sweat when I get nervous?
BUFFY	Don't worry, you'll do great.
LISHANNE	We're Sunnydale, Sunnydale
CHEER	We Never Fail, Never Fail
LISHANNE	Jump and Shoot, Swish and Score
CHEER	The Other Team Is Such a Bore YEAHHH!
AMY	That's my mom.
BUFFY	No... Catherine Madison. Get down with your bad self.
AMY	Her nickname was Catherine The Great: she took that team and made them tri-county champions, no one's ever done that before or since. She and my dad were homecoming King and Queen, got married right after graduation.
BUFFY	That's kinda romantic.
AMY	Well... he was a big loser, couldn't make any money, took off with Miss Trailer Trash when I was twelve.
BUFFY	Okay, that part's less romantic. My folks split up, too.
AMY	Drag, huh. He left my mom with nothing. She put herself through cosmetology school, bought me everything I ever wanted and never gained a single pound...
BUFFY	She sounds great, Amy, but that doesn't mean you have to, you know, lock step as far as the cheerleading thing --
AMY	...I gotta get changed...
WILLOW	Hi Amy... She okay?
BUFFY	She's wiggin' about her mother... ...the big cheer queen back when.
WILLOW	Yeah. Her mom's kinda...
BUFFY	Nazi-like?
WILLOW	Heil. If she gains an ounce she padlocks the fridge and won't eat anything but broth.
BUFFY	So Mommie Dearest is really... Mommie Dearest.
WILLOW	There's a bitter streak -- but Amy's nice. We used to hang in Junior High. When her mom'd go on a broth kick Amy'd come to my house and we'd just stuff ourselves with brownies.
BUFFY	Any word on Amber?
WILLOW	Nothing thrilling. Average student -- got detention once for smoking -- regular smoking, with a cigarette. Not being smoky. All pretty normal.
BUFFY	We'll just have to see what happens next. Maybe nothing will.
CORDELIA	I have a dream. It's me on the Cheerleading Squad, adored by every Varsity male as far as the eye can see. We have to achieve our dreams, Amy, otherwise we wither and die.
AMY	Look, I'm sorry about --
CORDELIA	Shhh. If your supreme klutziness out there today takes me out of the running you are going to be so very beyond sorry. Have a nice day.
WILLOW	I told Buffy about Amber.
XANDER	Cool. Was she wearing it? The bracelet. She was wearing it, right? That's pretty much like we're going out.
WILLOW	Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.
XANDER	So now I'm a figure of fun. I should just ask, right?
WILLOW	Won't know till you ask.
XANDER	See, this is why you're cool. You're like a guy. You're my guy friend that knows about girl stuff.
WILLOW	Oh great. I'm a guy.
LISHANNE	Yess!
AMY	I can't take this...
CORDELIA	You're lucky.
AMY	I made it?
CORDELIA	I made it.
XANDER	Any what better way to celebrate than with a romantic drive-through for two at --
WILLOW	Xander, alternates are the ones who didn't make the team. They only fill in if something happens to the ones who did.
BUFFY	Excuse me.
XANDER	For I am Xander, King of the Cretins, and all lesser cretins must bow before me.
BUFFY	At least it's over. And you know what I think we should do about it? Brownie pig-out, my house, now.
AMY	How many more hours a day can I practice? How much more can I do? This would never have happened to my mom. Never.
BUFFY	Mom, I accepted that you've had sex. I'm not ready to know you've had Farrah hair.
JOYCE	This is Gidget hair. Don't they teach you anything in history?
BUFFY	That's cool. I gotta book --
JOYCE	Well I was thinking, I mean I know the cheerleading thing didn't work out. Maybe you should think about joining the yearbook staff. I did it, and it was a lot of fun.
BUFFY	Not really my tip, mom.
JOYCE	I was photo editor. I got to be on every page. Made me look much more popular than I was.
BUFFY	Have you seen the kids who do yearbook, mom? Nerds pick on them.
JOYCE	Some of the best times I had in school were working on the yearbook.
BUFFY	This just in: I'm not you. I'm into my own thing.
JOYCE	Your own thing, whatever it is, got you kicked out of school. And we had to move here to find a decent school that would take you.
XANDER	Morning your Highness, beheadings at noon as usual? (to Willow, re: Cordelia's departing back). Okay, see how she has now clue I'm even a mammal, much less a human being?
WILLOW	None.
XANDER	This invisible man syndrome, a blessing in Cordelia's case, a curse in Buffy's.
WILLOW	You're not invisible to Buffy.
XANDER	Worse, I'm just part of the scenery, like an old shoe, or a rug you walk on every day but you never really see --
WILLOW	-- like a pen that's all chewed up and you know you should throw it away but you don't, not 'cause you really like it that much but more 'cause you're just so used to it and --
XANDER	Will. That is the point and let's not drive it through my head like a railroad spike. What I have do -- what I'm going to do -- is just what you said --
WILLOW	Throw away the pen, forget about Buffy. (tosses pen in trash)
XANDER	What I have to do -- what I'm going to do -- is be a man and ask her out. No more i.d. bracelets, subtle innuendo, or Polaroids outside her bedroom window late at night -- that last is a joke to relieve the tension because here she comes .
WILLOW	I know I'm relieved.
XANDER	Alright. Into battle I go. would you ask her out for me? No. Man. Me. Battle.
XANDER	Buffy, how would you like to...
BUFFY	Is that even Cordelia's locker?
XANDER	Huh? I don't know, what I'm saying here is, accompany me Friday night...
CORDELIA	What's happening?!? I can't see anything!
BUFFY	Cordelia, it's okay, you're gonna be -- Oh, god...
XANDER	First vampires, now witches... no wonder you can still afford a house in Sunnydale.
GILES	Why would someone want to harm Cordelia?
WILLOW	Maybe because... they met her. Did I say that?
GILES	Then why was Amber set ablaze?
XANDER	Yeah, those guys don't hang.
BUFFY	They're both cheerleaders.
GILES	Someone doesn't like cheerleading.
BUFFY	Or likes it too much.
WILLOW	Amy.
BUFFY	Amy.
XANDER	So you guys are leaning towards Amy.
BUFFY	She's desperate to get on that team... I get the feeling she'd do anything to make her mom's dream come true.
GILES	Now I do want to make sure I've got this right. This witch is casting horrible, disfiguring spells so that she can be a cheerleader.
BUFFY	Your point being?
GILES	Priorities. Really, if I had the power of the black mass I'd set my sights a little higher than making the pep squad.
BUFFY	I think you're underestimating the amount of pressure a parent can lay on you. If you're not a picture perfect carbon copy they tend to wig.
WILLOW	Cheerleading was kind of her mom's last hurrah.
XANDER	We still gotta stop Amy. We should grab her before --
GILES	Let's be certain she's the witch before we arouse her suspicions. She's capable of some fairly ugly things.
BUFFY	All right, you're a high school girl, you're desperate to make the team and please your mom, you turn to witchcraft. What's the first thing you do?
WILLOW	check out the books on witchcraft!
XANDER	That's the last thing you do! You don't leave a paper trail. Forget that --
WILLOW	It'll just take a minute --
XANDER	We don't have a minute. Cheerleaders' lives are in danger -- Buffy's in danger. (grabs Buffy, tries to hustle her out) You were the first alternate. You're on the team now that Cordelia's out -- you could be next, we have to get you to a safe house.
WILLOW	Xander ...
XANDER	Yes?
WILLOW	"Witches - Historic Roots to Modern Practice" checked out by Alexander Harris.
BUFFY	"The Pagan Rites", checked out by Alexander --
XANDER	All right, all right. It's not what you think.
WILLOW	You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?
XANDER	Oh. Well, then it is what you think.
GILES	We'll need a conclusive test anyway. There should be one - yes! The ducking stool. We throw her in the pond. If she floats, she's a witch; if she drowns, she's innocent. (off their looks) ... some of my texts are a bit outdated.
BUFFY	You think?
GILES	Ah! Yes. This should work. You'll need some of her hair, a little quicksilver and aqua fortis.
WILLOW	That's just mercury and nitric acid, we can get it in the science lab.
GILES	"Heat ingredients and apply to witch, if a spell has been cast in previous forty-eight hours witch's skin will turn blue." Oh, and you'll need some eye of newt.
WILLOW	One eye of newt...
XANDER	Wow, you've got a killer streak I've never seen before. Hope I never cross you.
WILLOW	I do too, then I'd have to carve you up in neat little pieces.
LISHANNE	Isn't this exciting?
BUFFY	Oh yeah.
BUFFY	Help. Which is the hydrochloric acid and which is the ammonium hydroxide?
AMY	Well, the bottle that says hydrochloric acid is usually the hydrochloric acid.
BUFFY	Read the bottles -- what a concept.
WILLOW	All set. You have a plan?
BUFFY	Spill it on her, try and make it look natural.
XANDER	We'll be right behind you. Only farther away.
XANDER	Did you see? Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.
WILLOW	So it's not her?
BUFFY	The test was positive. She's our Sabrina. I just don't think she realizes what she's doing.
WILLOW	Should we talk to her?
BUFFY	Maybe we should talk to her mother . I wonder if she knows what she's created.
BUFFY	Quality juice. Not from concentrate.
JOYCE	You're in a good mood.
BUFFY	I am. I'm on the squad. Which is great because I feel like cheering. And leading others to cheer. Hey, juice!
JOYCE	Listen honey, about yesterday...
BUFFY	That's totally yester. Besides, it's not like you were wrong. I did get kicked out. I'm wacky that way.
JOYCE	Still, I want you to know that despite the problems you've had --
BUFFY	Mom, you don't get it. Believe me, you don't want it. There's just things about being a vampire slayer that the older generation has a problem with.
JOYCE	A what?
BUFFY	Long story. I mean I'm kidding.
JOYCE	Buffy, are you feeling well?
BUFFY	I can't be in a good mood? That's a new house rule? Fine, I don't mind, cuz I'm a MACHO MACHO MAN...
WILLOW	We better get her out of there.
XANDER	Yeah, before she...
BUFFY	Did I do that?
CHEERLEADER	You are so out of here!
WILLOW	It's not her fault --
XANDER	She's on medication --
CHEERLEADER	Obviously not enough. Who's our next alternate -- oh.
CHEERLEADER	Amy, you just made cheerleader.
BUFFY	No no no, you don't want her, she's a wi--
BUFFY	She's a witchy!!
WILLOW	Buffy --
BUFFY	I just got kicked off the team, didn't I?
XANDER	I don't think it's your fault.
BUFFY	I know you don't. That's cause you're my friend. You're my Xander-shaped friend. ...do you have any idea why I love you so, Xander?
WILLOW	We gotta get you to --
XANDER	Let her speak!
BUFFY	I'll tell you. You're not like other guys at all...
XANDER	Well...
BUFFY	You are completely and totally one of the girls. I'm that comfy with you.
XANDER	That's great.
BUFFY	Any other guy gave me a bracelet, they'd want to date me, it'd be a thing, but you -- you --
WILLOW	Buffy?
BUFFY	Something is really... not good...
WILLOW	We gotta get her to a hospital.
GILES	They can't help her. This is a Bloodstone Vengeance Spell, hits the body hard, like drinking a quart of alcohol, then eradicates the immune system.
XANDER	Vengeance spell. Like she's getting even with Buffy?
BUFFY	'Cause she knows I know she's a witch.
GILES	The others she just wanted out of the running, you she intends to...
BUFFY	Kill.
WILLOW	How much time do we have?
GILES	I'm sure we have --
BUFFY	Truth please.
GILES	Couple of hours, three at most.
XANDER	So how do we reverse Buffy's spell?
GILES	I've been researching that. We can reverse all the spells if we can get our hands on Amy's spell book --
WILLOW	And if we can't get our hands on it?
GILES	The only other way is to cut the witch's head off.
XANDER	Show of hands...
BUFFY	No. It's not Amy's fault. She became a witch to survive her mother.
XANDER	I don't care why, I care that you go on breathing.
BUFFY	Giles, where would she be casting these spells?
GILES	She needs a sacred space with a pentagram, a large pot...
BUFFY	At home. Help me get up. We'll go to her house, find her book --
WILLOW	We'll go with you.
BUFFY	No. Stay here, keep an eye on Amy.
GILES	And keep her away from the science lab. We'll need it to cast our counter spells.
CATHERINE	What do you want? Is there something wrong?
GILES	Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to you about your daughter.
CATHERINE	I'm not allowed to -- you'll have to come back.
GILES	Your daughter is up to something very dangerous. Are you aware of that?
CATHERINE	I don't know what you're talking about.
GILES	I think you know very well.
CATHERINE	You have to go. She's gonna be home soon.
GILES	This girl is very sick. You will shut up and you will listen to me. You daughter has access to some very powerful magics. Somehow your obsession with cheerleading has made her --
CATHERINE	I don't care about cheerleading! It's not my fault she's doing stuff.
CATHERINE	She's out of her mind. Ever since control her.
GILES	You're afraid of her.
BUFFY	Are you Amy?
GILES	I don't understand...
BUFFY	She switched, didn't she? She switched your bodies. She wanted to relive her glory days. Catherine the Great.
GILES	Good lord...
BUFFY	Amy, it's gonna be okay.
CATHERINE	A few months ago I woke up in her bed, I didn't know where I was... and I looked in the mirror...
GILES	She locked herself upstairs. Where?
CATHERINE	She has a room in the attic.
GILES	Show me.
CATHERINE	If she finds out I've been in here she'll kill me.
GILES	My God...
GILES	I believe we can reverse your mother's spell. All of them, in fact.
CATHERINE	You really could?
GILES	Yes, but I need her books. There are certain volumes she would need for this kind of casting.
BUFFY	Did we find?
GILES	We found.
CATHERINE	Where are you going?
GILES	We're going to school. And you're coming with us.
CATHERINE	How is she?
GILES	We only have a few minutes.
CATHERINE	It's working...
GILES	Unlock the gate, let the darkness shine. Cover us with holy fear. Show me.
WILLOW	She must be heading for Buffy!
XANDER	Come on.
WILLOW	Amy!
AMY	Get out of my way!
WILLOW	Wait! I needed to talk to you. I can help you.
AMY	Help me? With what?
WILLOW	Well, you know, all your... witchcraft. I know a really good... cauldron... do you actually ride a broom or --
CATHERINE	You. You little brat.
AMY	Mom, please...
CATHERINE	That body was mine! Mine!
BUFFY	Oh, grow up.
GILES	Well, that was interesting.
BUFFY	Are you guys okay?
AMY	I'm fine.
GILES	I think all the spells were reversed. Of course, it's my first casting, I may have got it wrong.
BUFFY	You save my life. You were a god.
GILES	One doesn't want to be immodest, but I am not unsatisfied --
BUFFY	Giles, stop being so proper. You're in America. Brag.
XANDER	I got her! I got her! Cut her head off!
BUFFY	Xander, what are you doing?
XANDER	Saving you.
XANDER	But she's evil!
GILES	Well, it wasn't exactly her.
AMY	It was my mom.
XANDER	Oh.
WILLOW	Where is she?
XANDER	Willow! It's cool.
WILLOW	It is?
XANDER	Oh yeah. I took care of it.
JOYCE	I don't get it.
BUFFY	What?
JOYCE	I've been thinking a lot about where you're coming from, how to relate to you, and I've come to a simple conclusion. I don't get it. What you want, what you're thinking. Not a clue.
BUFFY	I'm inscrutable, huh?
JOYCE	You're sixteen. I think there's a biological imperative whereby I can't understand you because I'm not sixteen.
BUFFY	Do you ever wish you could be? Sixteen again?
JOYCE	There's a frightful notion. Go through all that again. No even if it helped me understand you.
AMY	Dad is so impossible. He doesn't ever want me going anywhere, wants to spend total quality time together. I'm like, "Dad, I can go out, it's perfectly safe." He's got all this guilt at leaving me with mom and he's being a total pain.
BUFFY	You're loving it.
AMY	Every single minute.
CORDELIA	Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got bumped back to alternate. Hold it -- wait -- no I'm not.
AMY	Well, I know I'll miss the intellectual thrill of spelling words out with my arms.
CORDELIA	Ooh, these grapes are sour.
AMY	Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you actually wanted to be on the squad.
BUFFY	No, that's okay. Cheerleading is just a little too hairy these days.
AMY	That's for sure.
AMY	Catherine the Great.
BUFFY	And there's been no sign of her?
AMY	That last spell, she said I'd never make trouble again. Wherever she is, I don't think we have to worry.
BUFFY	Twisted.
AMY	I'm just happy to have my body back. (as they walk off) I'm thinking of getting fat.
BUFFY	Well, that look is in for spring.

PARKER	Buffy?
BUFFY	Parker?
PARKER	Buffy, I don’t know what to say. After how I’ve treated you, and now I owe you my life.
BUFFY	It’s nothing.
PARKER	It’s everything. You’re everything. And I’m gonna do whatever it takes to get you to forgive me. Do you think… one day, you might?
WALSH	These are the things we want.
WALSH	Simple things. Comfort. Sex. Shelter. Food. We always want them, and we want them all the time. The id doesn’t learn. It doesn’t grow up. It has the ego telling it what it can’t have – and it has the superego telling what it shouldn’t want. But the id works solely by the pleasure principle. It wants. Whatever social skills we learn, however much we have evolved, the pleasure principle is at work in all of us.
PARKER	Buffy, I don’t know what to say. After how I’ve treated you, and now I owe you my life.
XANDER	Rough day?
XANDER	Come on Buffy, be a lonely drunk. Rough day?
BUFFY	Stop flicking at me.
XANDER	Work with me here. I'm finally an essential part of your collegey life. No more "looking down on the townie" - I'm the new bartender at the pub. Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face…
WILLOW	Aren't you too young to be a bartender?
XANDER	Au contraire, mon frere.
BUFFY	Frere means brother.
XANDER	Mon girl-frere. Behold.
WILLOW	I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.
XANDER	What gives it away?
WILLOW	Looking at it.
BUFFY	There's more to it than wiping and kicking.
BUFFY	Mixing drinks comes to mind.
XANDER	I've seen Cocktail. I can hippy hippy shake.
BUFFY	Well, Xander, even if I had a pretend cigarette, I couldn't tell you my problems. Real ones have clogged up my headspace.
XANDER	Then unload 'em right here, baby. Rough day? Wanna tell me about it? Shutting up now.
WILLOW	I'm pregnant by my step-brother who'd rather be with my best friend and left me with no place to live and no food, except for a bottle of Wild Turkey, which I drank all up.
WILLOW	That was me, being tanked and friendless for ya.
XANDER	Gets my Oscar nod.
BUFFY	Class time.
XANDER	So, you gonna come by tonight? To the pub?
WILLOW	Oz. Bronze. Date.
BUFFY	You know, it's probably just him, having trouble dealing, right? I mean, sometimes, guys keep the girls they really like inside these little deep-brain, fantasy bubbles where things are always perfect.
XANDER	How's that fugue state coming along?
WILLOW	(to Xander) Parker.
BUFFY	So, maybe, I'm in his bubble. And pretty soon, he'll just realize he wants more than just Bubble-Buffy. And, he'll pop me out and we'll have dinner and stuff. Guys totally do that, right?
WILLOW	Buffy that is my best friend, you need to think about not Parker. He's no good. There are other men - better men - men wherein the mind is stronger than the penis.
XANDER	Nothing can defeat the penis! Too loud, very unseemly.
WILLOW	I'm sorry to be coarse, but I feel strongly on the subject of stinky Parker man.
BUFFY	But he can be really sweet. You know, I think he has intimacy issues, 'cause of his father dying -
WILLOW	Not interested. You get troubles, tell 'em to the bartender.
XANDER	That's right. 'Cause the bartender's always ready to listen.
XANDER	What? WHAT?!
XANDER	Okay… (to others) You're a rum and coke, you're a Poker's Light… Vodka on the rocks and… A water? Is that right?
XANDER	Ice water - how do I make that?
ROOM	Dark. Floor and walls kinda grimy. But a pretty happening place for A WHOLE PILE OF COLLEGE KIDS.
RILEY	Whoah!
BUFFY	Oh! Sorry.
RILEY	You know, most people go around. I'm not saying you CAN'T tunnel through me, I just think the other way's quicker.
BUFFY	In my defense, you take up a lot of space.
RILEY	I do. I'm ungainly. You looking for someone?
BUFFY	Uh, no, I… saw Parker there…
RILEY	Right, Parker and his latest conquest. That boy should have his attention span checked.
BUFFY	(fishing, not thrilled) He's kind of a girl chaser, huh?
RILEY	Sets 'em up and knocks 'em down. I guess maybe I'm old fashioned, but my father always says if you want to be a gentleman… you don't care even the slightest bit what my father says.
BUFFY	Sorry, what?
RILEY	Forget about it. I got people waiting. I'll see you in class.
BUFFY	Uh huh…
XANDER	Rough day?
PAULA	Nah, I've been super.
PAULA	We accepted Melody's pledge and made her an official sister of Beta Delta Gamma. And, our pins arrived today. I designed them myself!
XANDER	You are so sharp.
COLM	Hey, Paula. Are you keeping this fine bartender from his duties? Man's got to earn a living.
XANDER	S'alright.
COLM	So, the guys and I were celebrating about the…
XANDER	No really, it's alright. I'm due for a break.
COLM	Oh. So, what were you discussing? Maybe we can all join.
PAULA	Oh be nice.
XANDER	Hm, no, forget it.
COLM	No, I rudely interrupted. And it sounds like you two were having quite the meeting of minds. Possibly debating the geo-political ramifications of bio-engineering? You have a take on that?
XANDER	I've got beer. Want some beer?
COLM	Pitcher of Black Frost. (as Xander pours) See, I think we have a perfect venue here for conducting sociometry here. Bipolar continuum of attraction and rejection. Given your socio-economic statuses, I foresee a… …"B" rejects "A" diad.
COLM	I'm sorry, let me clarify. You see, we are this country's future. You keep the bowl of peanuts full. We are what these girls want.
COLM	And four glasses.
XANDER	How about I see some I.D. first? 'Cause you're not getting a drop until I'm satisfied that -
JACK	Just give 'em the beer.
XANDER	Buffy?
XANDER	Rough day? Want to tell me about it?
BUFFY	It's just… Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it. And I knew that, I knew what he was, but… You know, if he were tied up and gagged and left in a cave that vampires HAPPENED to frequent that wouldn't really be like I killed him really…
XANDER	Buffy…
BUFFY	I'm a slut.
XANDER	No.
BUFFY	A big, lecherous loser.
XANDER	No.
JACK	Hey!
XANDER	Sorry. So sorry.
BUFFY	I'm better. This has helped.
XANDER	Don't go anywhere.
BUFFY	Sorry. I'm bumping into people today.
ROY	I can't imagine anybody minding…
ROY	You're not thinking of leaving, are you? 'Cause we have a strict policy against you leaving. At least until you've had a drink.
COLM	My friend's just saying, you shouldn't be alone and sad right now. You're a beautiful girl who should be covered with men. And could we be those men?
KIP	It's on us.
OZ	You got a table.
WILLOW	I had to kill a man.
OZ	Well, it’s a really good table.
WILLOW	I copied out my notes for psyche, since you were so elsewhere this morning. It’s pretty simple stuff –
OZ	I...don’t know. Feel a little... it’s nothing.
WILLOW	We could go to your place. I could make soup.
OZ	No thanks. I’ll be fine.
WILLOW	Do you know her?
OZ	Veruca? No, I’ve met the drummer, he’s cool. Never heard them play...
GUYS	Chug! Chug! Chug!
COLM	The thing the modern day pundits fail to realize is that all of the socioeconomic and psychological problems inherent in modern society can be solved by the judicious application of way too much beer.
BUFFY	My mother always says that beer is evil.
COLM	Evil, good, these are moral absolutes that predate the fermentation of malt and fine hops. See…where was I?
BUFFY	I’m not really sure.
KIP	Well, Thomas Aquinas said –
ROY	No! There will be no Thomas Aquinas at this table!
HUNT	Keep your Theology of Providence to yourself, fatboy.
KIP	I was just drawing a parallel to –
COLM	Beer! Had the earliest morality been developed under the influence of beer there would be no good and evil. There would be “kinda nice” and “pretty cool”. Everything would be different.
BUFFY	You guys just love to hear yourselves speak, don’t you?
COLM	We’re losing her, guys…
ROY	Say something interesting!
HUNT	Well, tell us about yourself.
COLM	Yeah. What do you like?
BUFFY	Well, I don’t hate this, for a start.
WILLOW	"I'm Oz, I'm in a band, too. And this is Willow." "How fun, a groupie!" GROUPIE!
BUFFY	TV is a good thing. Bright colors, music… little tiny people.
WILLOW	Whoah, what you have you done with Buffy?
BUFFY	I'm suffering the after-ness of a bad night of badness.
WILLOW	You didn't ! Not with Parker again.
BUFFY	No, with five really smart guys.
WILLOW	Five! Ow. Oh. Oh, Buffy. Are you okay? Want to tell me about it?
BUFFY	I went to see Xander, but then I saw Parker and… then came beer.
WILLOW	And then group sex?
BUFFY	Pfah… gutter-face, no! Just lots 'n lots 'o beer. It's nice. Foamy and comforting. It's beer.
WILLOW	Drowning your troubles 'cause of Parker, the mind-frying man! He deserves a torturous and slow death by spider bites. Well, for today, we can shoot spit balls at the back of his neck in class.
BUFFY	Okay.
WILLOW	But getting dressed would be fun, too.
WALSH	Yes?
BUFFY	She read the… reading.
WALSH	Well then, she’ll have some time on her hands. As I was saying…
WILLOW	BUFFY!
BUFFY	Sure, why wouldn’t I be?
BUFFY	S'good… good enough!
COLM	No more? But s'good.
BUFFY	Yeah. Foamy.
KIP	You should come to our class on big thinking. S'good.
WOMAN	Boy, I'm having the worst day…
WOMAN	You got a light?
COLM	I like girls.
BUFFY	You're stupid!
COLM	No, you! Stupid!
ROY	No, you stupid!
BUFFY	Smelly head.
WILLOW	Oz…
OZ	Hey, I tried calling you.
WILLOW	I’ve been at the library. How are you feeling?
OZ	What do you mean?
WILLOW	You weren’t in class… …again.
OZ	Yeah, band was practicing. Listen, Shy is playing again tonight –
WILLOW	Shy?
OZ	Veruca’s band. They asked me to sit in with them. Be cool if you were there…
WILLOW	Two Veruca shows in two nights… Sure you want to share your groupie? I think I’m just gonna study. ‘Cause of the fun.
OZ	Oh. Okay. I guess it might be kind of dull for you.
WILLOW	See ya.
OZ	Yeah.
COLM	You stupid.
ROY	No, you stupid.
BUFFY	No, you .
BUFFY	Hey!
BUFFY	It sings!
BUFFY	Like it.
XANDER	Time to go home, Buffy.
BUFFY	Want more singing. Want more… beer.
XANDER	No. I've cut you off.
BUFFY	Did it hurt?
XANDER	Out you go.
BUFFY	No. Like beer. Beer…good.
XANDER	No, beer bad. Bad, bad beer. What the hell am I saying? Go home and go to bed.
BUFFY	Say bye.
XANDER	Bye.
BUFFY	Bye.
COLM	Where woman go?
PARKER	Hey.
WILLOW	Yes. I wanna give you a piece of my mind. ‘Cause I’ve had it with you and your… man-ness. Buffy is really hurting right now. In fact, she’s in need of a big mental tidy. Parker, how could you do this to her?
PARKER	I don’t get what you mean. What did I “do”?
WILLOW	She shared a very intimate thing with you. And you act like it was nothing more than a bag of… some kind of snack food!
PARKER	Willow. I’m not sure I need to explain my actions here. But if that’s what you want…
WILLOW	Yes, followed by an admission of undeniable guilt, but go on.
PARKER	Some relationships center on a deep emotional tie or…a loyal friendship or something. But most are just two people passing through life, enriching or aggravating each other’s lives briefly.
WILLOW	Go on.
PARKER	Just for one night. Can’t two people who feel an attraction come together and create something wonderful? And then, go back to their lives the next day, better for it, but never over-analyzing it or wanting it to be more than it was?
WILLOW	People like Buffy, and…and me…assume intimacy means friendship, and respect. People shouldn’t have to ask first, “Are you going to be eyeing other prospects tomorrow?”
PARKER	And people shouldn’t have to preface casual sex with, “Just so you know, I’ll never grow any older with you.” Takes the fire out of it. You see where I’m coming from?
WILLOW	Maybe.
PARKER	You’re a good friend.
XANDER	Pay up and go home, guys.
COLM	Mmph.
XANDER	(picking through them) I'll take this one and this one. And… Man, you know, I've always had a problem calculating the tip. And you guys being so dapper of brain, maybe you could help me.
XANDER	Good. Okay. See, if your bill comes to sixty dollars. And generally, people tip… what, approximately thirty percent? That would make your tip, what?
XANDER	You are so smart! This is so the right amount!
XANDER	Somebody didn't have their fiber today.
XANDER	Hey, you alright in there?
CREATURE	AAAAARRRRGGGHH!
ROY	Oh…God…
HUNT	S'get outa h-
XANDER	Colm?
XANDER	We're cool. Easy.
XANDER	Help! Oh God.
COLM	Fire. Bad. Fire…pretty.
XANDER	Fire angry!
XANDER	Jack, JACK! We got a problem. They guys, they, they're… some of your patrons are turning into cave men.
JACK	They had it coming.
XANDER	What!?
JACK	I have been taking abuse from snot-nosed kids for twenty years. Come in here with their snotty attitudes, drinking their fruity microbrews and spouting on about philosophy like it means a damn thing. Think they're different than us.
XANDER	Well they are now…
JACK	They ain't. That's the great thing about beer. Makes all men the same.
XANDER	Why are we talking about beer? The guys are… …the beer.
JACK	Neat, huh? My brother in law's a warlock. Showed me how to -
XANDER	No! No neat! I served them that beer. I served Buffy that beer. Uh, how much beer would you say a person would need to consume before they started seriously questing for fire?
JACK	Relax. It'll wear off in a day or so.
XANDER	In a day or so, someone's gonna get killed.
XANDER	You're a bad bad man.
DRIVER	I didn’t see him! Is he okay?
XANDER	I cut her off before the others. I don't think she had as much to drink.
GILES	I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.
XANDER	I didn't know it was evil!
GILES	You knew it was beer …
XANDER	Well excuse me Mr. I-Spent-the-60's -in-an-electric-koolaid-funky-satan-groove.
GILES	Early seventies and you should both know better.
XANDER	Hey, I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown up, and she's intelligent enough to -
BUFFY	Parker bad!
PARKER	I don't mean this in a bragging way, but I do get to know a lot of women.
WILLOW	Well, getting to know people is good.
PARKER	But I haven't found the "one" yet. I've yet to find a girl that I can just… you know, sit with, feeling totally at ease spewing whatever's on my mind. Or even sit with, comfortably in silence.
PARKER	Willow… Can I tell you something private?
WILLOW	Okay. I mean, I feel like you've shown me a perspective I hadn't really thought much about before.
PARKER	Just that I've enjoyed talking with you. Here, tonight.
WILLOW	Me too. I mean, with you. You know, I'm wondering something. About you.
PARKER	What?
WILLOW	(maintains sweet tone) Just how gullible do you think I am? I mean, with your gentle eyes and your shy smile and your ability to talk openly with only me… You're unbelievable!
PARKER	What?
WILLOW	This isn't sharing. This isn't connecting. It's the pleasure principle! That's right, I've got your number, Id Boy. Only thing you're thinking about is how long before you can jump on my bones!
PARKER	Look, if you think -
WILLOW	You men! It's all about the sex. Find a woman, drag her to your den. Do whatever's necessary. Just as long as you get the sex. I tell you, men have not changed since the dawn of time!
WILLOW	See!?!
WILLOW	This way!
GILES	Fascinating, really.
BUFFY	Want people. Where people go?
GILES	The TV is off.
BUFFY	WANT! Want people!
GILES	Well, at least she doesn't seem to be in any immediate danger. Maybe you should just stay with her…
BUFFY	Boy smell nice.
GILES	Or perhaps she should be alone.
XANDER	Yeah, I think we need to track down the funboys somewhat pronto. Jack said the beer wouldn't wear off till -
BUFFY	Beer! Want beer!
GILES	You can't have beer -
BUFFY	Want beer.
XANDER	Giles, don't make caveslayer unhappy…
XANDER	Yes, Buffy strong.
XANDER	No, Buffy get -
XANDER	Giles…
GILES	I'm fine. Get her.
XANDER	Which way?
GILES	Let's split up. We've got to find her before someone gets hurt.
HUNT	Woman. (punches self) Man.
COLM	Woman! Yaahhh!
XANDER	Buffy!…Buffy!…
XANDER	Ah hah. Can't find the beer. Good. Freshman girl not able to hold the beer, should not have it. Get into trouble.
XANDER	Okay, all good, remember the boy, boy smell nice? Yeah? Any part of Buffy still in there?
XANDER	Oh no.
BUFFY	Fire…bad!
BUFFY	AAHOOWW!
WILLOW	Buffy…
XANDER	Need help. Where the hell is Giles!?
GILES	…Blond, this tall, walks with a… (Giles demonstrates) …bit of a sideways limp… you didn’t hear anything at all, I’m sure she came this way –
STONER	Yer from England!
XANDER	Buffy!!
BUFFY	Bad, bad, bad…
XANDER	(to the caveboys) Stay.
XANDER	Are you all right?
WILLOW	Buffy's still in there…
PARKER	Oh God…
PARKER	Help me… I can't breathe…
PARKER	Buffy, what do we do, oh God…
XANDER	You guys had enough fun for one night?
WILLOW	Yes please.
BUFFY	Tired.
XANDER	And was there a lesson in all this? What have we learned about beer?
BUFFY	Foamy.
XANDER	Good. Just as long as we're clear.
XANDER	Anyway, I think the boys are contained for the time being.
XANDER	They'll figure out how to work the door locks when the effect has worn off. And they'll just think they had too much beer. Which is surely close enough.
WILLOW	Whose van is that?
XANDER	I dunno. Wasn't locked.
PARKER	Buffy. I… I don't know how to say this. I'm sorry for how I treated you before. It was wrong of me, and… I'm sorry. And, you were great tonight. Really. I may not deserve this, but… Do you think, you could… forgive me?
PARKER	Buffy?
BUFFY	Parker?
PARKER	Buffy, I don’t know what to say. After how I’ve treated you, and now I owe you my life.
BUFFY	It’s nothing.
PARKER	It’s everything. You’re everything. And I’m gonna do whatever it takes to get you to forgive me. Do you think… one day, you might?
OZ	You got a table.
WILLOW	I had to kill a man.

COLM	Yeah. What do you like?
WALSH	Yes?
BUFFY	She read the… reading.
BUFFY	Sure, why wouldn’t I be?
WILLOW	Oz…
OZ	Hey, I tried calling you.
WILLOW	I’ve been at the library. How are you feeling?
OZ	What do you mean?

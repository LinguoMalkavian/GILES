BUFFY	Come on. We have to keep moving.
XANDER	I think I'm gonna be sick.
ANYA	Again?
BUFFY	Xander, we don't have time.
XANDER	I know, it's just - what happened back there, the sounds of it. The smell ...
BUFFY	I know.
XANDER	Willow did that.
BUFFY	That's why we have to move.
ANYA	So we're thinking 'two to go'. Jonathan. And, whatsisface, the other guy.
BUFFY	Andrew. Both of them are just sitting in the county jail without a clue Willow's coming.
XANDER	You don't think she's gonna kill them too? She wouldn't. There's no good reason.
BUFFY	Will's got an addictive personality, and she's just tasted blood. She could be there already.
ANYA	No she couldn't. A witch at her level? She could only go airborne. It's a thing. Very flashy, impresses the locals, but it does take longer.
XANDER	Longer than what?
ANYA	Teleporting.
XANDER	Right, Vengeance Demon. How could I... at least she'll get there first.
BUFFY	And I'm counting the ways that could go wrong.
XANDER	Anya can handle herself.
BUFFY	Against Willow - tonight - don't be too sure.
XANDER	She's got to come down sometime, doesn't she? I mean back there she was out of her head - running on grief and Magicks.
BUFFY	Doesn't matter - Willow just killed somebody. Killing changes you. Believe me: I know.
XANDER	Warren was a stone cold killer of women just getting warmed up. You ask me? Bastard had it coming.
BUFFY	Maybe. Jonathan and Andrew don't.
XANDER	This is still Willow we're dealing with, right?
BUFFY	I hope so. I mean, I want to believe that as much as you do, but whatever she's going through, we gotta stop her. And maybe we can if we get to your...
XANDER	Willow...
BUFFY	Looks like she wants to finish the job without us tagging along. Meet me at the jail.
XANDER	Sure, but how are you gonna...
ANDREW	Dude. Move like, a foot to your left.
JONATHAN	What for?
ANDREW	I'm trying to hear something.
JONATHAN	Like what?
ANDREW	Signals -
JONATHAN	Oh for crying out loud. Signals? Who from, your probe-happy alien friends? Say - maybe we can trade in some cigarettes for tin foil - make you a nice antenna hat...
ANDREW	Laugh it up, Fuzzball. I figured it out. Warren never abandoned us. Well, not me, anyway. This is like his test. If we can just figure out how he's communicating with us, we'll be, you know, worthy.
JONATHAN	You're checking for implants ?
ANDREW	Lex Luthor had a false epidermis escape kit in Superman versus the Amazing Spider-Man Treasury edition ...
JONATHAN	Okay, first of all, those were sonic disrupters and second of all ...you are sadness personified. Waiting for Warren? Yeah, maybe he'll bust us out of here on Santa's magic sleigh.
ANDREW	I'm telling him you said that.
JONATHAN	Why wait - I'll tell him myself.
ANDREW	Shut up, Jerk-athan! See this? This is why we get the jet packs and all you get is left behind.
JONATHAN	So you admit it.
ANDREW	Why not? You were out of the Trio a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away and you know why, little feller? No respect for the chain of command.
JONATHAN	Yeah, look how far it got you. Checking every hole in your sad little body for transmitters that don't exist.
ANDREW	Oh I'll find it if I have to check every hole in my body and yours.
JONATHAN	Get off!
ANDREW	Make me!
ANYA	There you two are. Listen to me. We have to get you out of here now or you'll both be killed. Guard!
JONATHAN	What's going on?
ANYA	Guard!
ANDREW	Stop that! (to Jonathan) I don't trust her. Do you trust her? This is major uncool...
JONATHAN	Anya, you gotta break this down for us a little, or...
ANYA	Warren shot Buffy. Warren shot Tara. Buffy's alive. Tara's dead. Willow found out and being the most powerful Wicca in the western hemisphere, she went for the payback. With interest.
ANDREW	Wh-what about Warren?
ANYA	She killed him. Ripped him apart and bloodied up the forest doing it. Now she's coming here and you two are next.
ANDREW	Oh my God... Warren.
JONATHAN	Oh my God - me. GUARD!
ANDREW	But we didn't do anything...
JONATHAN	GUARD!
OFFICER	All right, all right, what do you... Who the hell are you?
ANYA	Something's coming. Something bad. You have to let these men out or I guarantee you there will be hell to pay.
OFFICER	Okay, and, uh...what exactly's coming?
ANYA	One of the many things in this world you are not prepared to deal with.
OFFICER	That a fact?
ANYA	Yes. And we're out of time. Just believe me when I tell you...
COP	What the hell was that? Listen, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you better...
WILLOW	Take a nap.
ANYA	... So please, stop looking at me like it's your first trip to the circus and do your job - let them out!
ANDREW	Oh, what the hell is that?
JONATHAN	It's her.
OFFICER	You three. Stay here.
ANDREW	Oh, like we have a choice!
OFFICER	I said, don't move. You'll be safe here.
ANYA	Were you listening?!? This is the one place they won't be safe!
WILLOW	Back off.
ANDREW	Stop it! Just, stop! Why is she doing this? Tell her! We didn't do anything.
JONATHAN	Yes we did. We signed on. We teamed up. We wanted to see where all our plans would take us, well take a look.
ANDREW	For you, maybe. Anya! Teleport us out of here. Take us with you!
ANYA	I can't. It doesn't work that way.
ANDREW	Oh, God. HEEELP!
WILLOW	Gotta fly.
ANYA	Willow - just, stop for a second and listen to...
ANDREW	Aah! What is that sound? God, it kills.
BUFFY	We have to make a run for it.
ANDREW	Are you kidding? She's like Dark Phoenix up there! And you expect us to just outrun her?
BUFFY	Pretty much.
XANDER	Get in.
BUFFY	Is she coming?
XANDER	I don't see anything.
BUFFY	You guys all right?
JONATHAN	No. I, I don't think so.
ANDREW	Where are you taking us?
BUFFY	We'll find someplace safe and keep you there until we can stop Willow.
ANDREW	"Run and hide?" That's your brilliant plan?
JONATHAN	I don't believe this ...
XANDER	Boys? If you don't knock it off, I will pull this car over and you can just walk to your painful deaths from here.
JONATHAN	I don't get it. Willow's a witch. Why doesn't she just ... you know ... wave her arms and make us dead?
BUFFY	She doesn't want you dead. She wants to kill you.
ANDREW	But we didn't do anything!
XANDER	Hate to admit it, Buff, but Jonathan may have a point. Why isn't she right here right now?
BUFFY	Maybe, maybe she's just getting her mojo up and running, or maybe she hasn't figured out how much power she really has yet. And neither have we.
XANDER	Guess we keep running, then.
JONATHAN	I still can't believe that was Willow. I mean... I've known her almost as long as you guys. Willow was... you know. She packed her own lunches and wore floods and she was always... just Willow.
ANDREW	What was that?
XANDER	Just Willow.
BUFFY	Drive faster.
XANDER	Well, this is faster...
JONATHAN	She knows you're in this car too, right? Right?
XANDER	She's what-ing?
JONATHAN	Just keep going.
ANDREW	Cool.
CLEM	So gritty. Kinda hurts my tongue, so I'd give 'em... a seven. Seven-five maybe and you think this is dumb, don't you?
DAWN	No! As taste tests go, this is definitely one of the better ones I've been to.
CLEM	I get it. No biggie. You wanna play cards?
DAWN	Clem...
CLEM	I can be a real boredom-buster, if you just give me half a chance.
DAWN	It's not you.
CLEM	Still, I feel responsible. It's not fair - girl your age, cooped up in a crypt. Tell you what: let me get my hat and coat - I'll take you to a movie. We'll go nuts. PG- thirteen.
DAWN	Clem! Look at me - do I look weak to you? Or incapable?
CLEM	Heck no.
DAWN	So why am I stuck here?
CLEM	No good reason I can see.
DAWN	Tara was my friend as much as she was anybody else's.
CLEM	Sure, I could see that. You two Were ... I'm still real sorry about what happened. If there's anything I can do to help... just name it.
DAWN	Anything?
CLEM	Aw, you're not going to get yourself in trouble now, are you?
DAWN	I need a demon to help me. Spike would have.
CLEM	Spike's gone.
VOICE	You understand, then.
SPIKE	Yeah yeah - it's not like you haven't been clear about it, oh great mysterious one. This is a test. I don't get what I want unless I pass said test. That about the size and shape?
VOICE	Yes.
SPIKE	And since you got your pad decked out gladiator style, and no number two pencils have been provided - I guess we're not starting with the written.
VOICE	To the death.
SPIKE	Right. Here we are now. Entertain us.
XANDER	Thanks, Anya. For getting here so fast. It's a big help.
ANYA	And once again, we find Xander Harris needing the big help.
XANDER	Whatever. So? Can you still sense Willow?
ANYA	No. I can't. And that means whatever she's feeling, it's gone way beyond simple vengeance.
XANDER	Did I mention the me needing comfort ?
BUFFY	Whatever we've got here, better grab it fast. This is going to be one of the first places Willow would think to look for us.
ANDREW	Then what are we doing here?
XANDER	And I could smack you so hard your eyeballs switch sockets.
BUFFY	No one is getting killed. Sit down. We've got to find some kind of Magicks that'll stop Willow.
XANDER	But she drained the place.
ANYA	Not everything.
XANDER	What is it?
ANYA	Book of protection spells. Anti- Magic. Our last resort.
XANDER	Think you can work this stuff?
ANYA	Ah. Okay. The good news is - text is intact. Bad news is - I can't read a word of it. It's like in, ancient Sumerian or something.
JONATHAN	Can I take a look at--
BUFFY	Shut up.
JONATHAN	Right.
BUFFY	I'm not protecting you, Jonathan. None of us are. We're doing this for Willow. And the only reason it happens to be your lucky day is because if she kills you, a line gets crossed, I lose a friend. And I hate losing.
JONATHAN	I get that. It's just... you know she's running out of power, right? I could tell, I could practically feel it. I've dabbled in the Magicks.
XANDER	I'm thinking Willow's in a league of her own about now, dabble-boy.
JONATHAN	But still - running that hot for that long... ... Just a matter of time before you gotta re-charge. No matter how juiced up you are.
BUFFY	Thank you. Now remember that thing we talked about?
JONATHAN	About me shutting up?
XANDER	Buffy, say this works. And we stop Willow from working the hoodoo for a minute. What then?
BUFFY	I talk to her.
XANDER	Great. And say what?
BUFFY	Whatever she's going to do, she starts with these two. They're the line she cannot cross. And if she's running low on the Magicks ...she's probably somewhere now trying to get it all back.
DAWN	Rack's place was right around here last time...
CLEM	I don't feel anything. Oh well. Not here. Let's go home.
DAWN	You don't feel anything because his place moves. I told you.
CLEM	Know why? Rack moves all the time? Because he's shady. A bad element comes down here.
DAWN	I get that. But Willow's part of it now... She is the element. Rack may know where she is. Which is why we need to talk to him.
CLEM	We? In a... face to face way?
DAWN	Or me. I'll go in without you.
CLEM	No, it's fine. I'm good... It's just, Rack isn't partial to the floppy-eared. He's got a thing. But I'm in. Absolutely.
DAWN	Either way. Just get me there.
CLEM	Say Rack does. Know where Willow is. He's not going to tell you for nothing. He's gonna want something.
DAWN	I have money.
CLEM	I don't think that's the kind of something he's gonna want. Rack likes little girls -
DAWN	I am not a little girl.
CLEM	Sorry. Of course. Little, that's wrong. But girl, I stand behind. I mean, you definately have... You're clearly... You have parts-
DAWN	Look - are you going to help me or not?
CLEM	I just - I don't know if you've thought this through. I'm supposed to keep you safe and this whole thing is... I mean, even if you find Willow, you really think you can stop her?
DAWN	I don't know. But I can't sit around while another person I love- I can't just sit around.
CLEM	We don't have a plan. Don't we at least need a plan?
DAWN	Buffy and her friends never have a plan. They just sort of... jump in and don't know what they're doing.
CLEM	And this works?
DAWN	They never really let me come along... Guess we'll find out. (off his look) It's okay. I mean, they usually come back in one piece.
CLEM	Usually?
RACK	Hey, babe. I been waiting for you.
WILLOW	I'm just gonna take a little tour.
DAWN	Yay, Clem, making with the demon senses! I knew you'd find this place!
CLEM	I don't think it's very clean.
DAWN	Don't wig out on me again.
CLEM	I'm still not so sure you should be here. I'm not so sure I should be here...
DAWN	It'll just take a minute. Come on.
CLEM	If that works for you...
DAWN	Be right back.
DAWN	Willow?
WILLOW	Hey, cutie.
WILLOW	Dawny, what are you doing here? 'Cause, if you're looking for me - it's not a great time.
DAWN	You look terrible.
WILLOW	Do I?
DAWN	You're back on the Magicks.
WILLOW	No, honey. I am the Magicks.
DAWN	Did you kill that guy?
WILLOW	It's an improvement. Believe me.
DAWN	I gotta go.
WILLOW	Why? So you can run and tell Buffy?
DAWN	Willow. Just, listen to me.
WILLOW	We don't have to talk. Just think real loud - I can hear you.
DAWN	You're freaking me out.
WILLOW	Don't be like that I'm just a little wired, and have some things to do. I thought if anybody'd understand, it'd be...
DAWN	I miss Tara, too.
WILLOW	You miss her?
DAWN	Yes.
WILLOW	Did you cry? Of course you did. I get that, I understand the crying, you cry because you're human. But you weren't always.
DAWN	Yes I was...
WILLOW	No - please, you're telling me you don't remember? You used to be ...what, some mystic ball of energy. Maybe that's why you're crying all the time, "Dawny." You don't belong here.
DAWN	Willow... stop...
WILLOW	"Mom!" "Buffy!" "Tara!" Waah! Come on, someone's gotta stop the carnage. It's time you went back to being a little energy ball.
BUFFY	I think you need to get away from her.
ANYA	You're too close.
XANDER	How am I supposed to read?
ANYA	I don't know. I'm looking right at this stuff and I can't read it.
XANDER	How's the translation coming? What have we got so far?
JONATHAN	I'm pretty sure it's Babylonian. The text is similar, but it's a whole different dialect.
XANDER	Great. Babylonian. Because you know, that's easy.
ANDREW	Why are you helping them?
JONATHAN	Because they're saving our lives, you moron.
ANDREW	Uh-huh. And what then? Even if they kill that Wicca bitch, you think they'll just let us walk? They own us.
JONATHAN	So what do you want me to do?
ANDREW	Look around. You know Magick. We're in a Magic Shop. We can take them.
JONATHAN	And do what?
ANDREW	Start over We can be the Duo. You and me, you can even be the leader, I swear, I'll take orders. I like orders. Just tell me what to do.
JONATHAN	You want an order?
XANDER	Hey now - play nice, fellas, or you'll break our concentration.
ANYA	Which means no protection spell...
XANDER	And Willow will make sure you two boneless chickens are skinless, too.
ANDREW	Then what? You think your Li'l Witch buddy's gonna stop with us? You saw her! She's a truck driving Magic Mamma. We've got maybe seconds before Darth Rosenberg grinds everybody into Jawa-burgers, and not one of you bunch has the midiclorians to stop her.
XANDER	You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?
ANYA	The annoying virgin has a point. What if Willow filets their sole and then comes after --
XANDER	She won't.
ANYA	You don't know that.
XANDER	We're her friends, Anya. Her family. She would never hurt us.
ANYA	She tried to use you for a hood ornament, Xander. She doesn't care if you live or die.
XANDER	Guess you two finally have something in common
ANYA	I care if you live or die, Xander. I'm just not sure which one I want.
XANDER	Again with the comfort. Look, we both know things might get ugly at Wiccapalooza. If it gets really bad --
ANYA	Let me guess. You'll propose.
XANDER	I need to know if you're gonna turn on me.
ANYA	There is nothing in this world that could give me greater or more lasting satisfaction than reaping bloody vengeance upon you, Xander Harris.
XANDER	Right, 'cause you varnishing the table with Spike -- how could that possibly have hurt? It may have chaffed ...
ANYA	That wasn't vengeance. It was solace.
XANDER	If that's what you need to do.
ANYA	Don't. You don't get to play the martyr.
XANDER	I'm not.
ANYA	None of this would be happening if it weren't for you.
XANDER	You think I don't know that? You think I'm the hero of this piece? I saw the gun. Before Warren even raised it, I saw it, and... I couldn't move. He shot two of my friends before I could even... You want me to know how useless I am? That it's my fault? Thanks. Already got the memo.
ANYA	(a beat, then sadly) I was talking about us.
XANDER	You want to hate me, you want to make me suffer for what I did to you -- fine. Do whatever you want. After we save Willow.
BUFFY	You need to back down and think a minute, Will.
WILLOW	Wasn't gonna hurt her, Buzzkill.
DAWN	She tried to turn me back...
BUFFY	You're attacking the people who love you now?
WILLOW	Only the ones in my way...
BUFFY	That's not... you need help.
WILLOW	Doing fine on my own, thanks.
BUFFY	Dawn - get out of here. Go.
WILLOW	Don't. We're all friends.
BUFFY	I know what you want to do, Willow, but listen to me: the forces inside you are incredibly powerful. They're strong, but you're stronger. Just remember - you're still Willow.
WILLOW	Let me tell you something about Willow: she's a loser. And she always has been. Everyone picked on Willow in junior high, high school, up until college with her stupid mousy ways and now - Willow's a junkie.
BUFFY	I can help.
WILLOW	The only thing Willow was ever good for...
BUFFY	I know - this hurts, bad - but Will, if you let loose with the Magicks now, it will never end.
WILLOW	Promise?
BUFFY	You don't want that.
WILLOW	Why not?
BUFFY	Because you lose everything. Your friends, your self... you let this control you and the world goes away. That's not... Willow, there's so much to --
WILLOW	Ack! Please! This is your pitch? You hate it here as much as I do. I'm just more honest about it.
BUFFY	That's not true...
WILLOW	You're trying to sell me on the world. The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them and you screw a vampire just to feel and insane asylums are the comfy alternative. This world? Buffy, it's me! I know you were happier in the ground - hanging with the worms. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life is when you were dead. Until Willow brought you back.
WILLOW	Sorry. It can be kind of a rough trip if you're, you know - not me.
BUFFY	Dawn...
WILLOW	Jonathan. Andrew. You boys like Magicks, don't you?
WILLOW	Okay, I didn't see that coming.
ANDREW	W-what just happened?
JONATHAN	We're alive.
WILLOW	You want to take it slow? I can do that, too. Ask Warren.
BUFFY	No...
ANYA	(Sumerian, phonetic) Goo-roo-meh ning-in-meh, noo-gull-gull-ah, goo-roo- meh ning-in-meh, cheh-meh- dull -dull -eh.
ANYA	Shield around us, never broken, shield surrounds us, keep us from harm...
JONATHAN	Let's get out of here.
WILLOW	No, no, stay.
BUFFY	Will...
XANDER	Don't.
WILLOW	Guys... c'mon. I'm getting the wood for the violence here. And you know what they say - if at first you don't succeed...
SPIKE	Had enough?
VOICE	So it would appear.
SPIKE	Good on me, then. So? I get what I came for? I passed, right?
VOICE	Indeed. You have passed the first stage of the test.
SPIKE	Right, then I... wait... first stage ?
WILLOW	Damn, that is one effective counter-spell.
BUFFY	Will, stop. You have to give this up, now.
WILLOW	(ignoring Buffy) Oh, I get it. You boys put a spell on yourselves, didn't you. On everyone here. Protecting you from harm - from Magicks. That's cute.
BUFFY	Will - back off before somebody gets hurt.
WILLOW	How about I back off right after? So which one of you worked the mojo?
WILLOW	(Latin, phonetic) DAH MEE-hee WIM.
WILLOW	Give me Strength .
WILLOW	All right. Now, I'm pretty sure I'm strong enough...
BUFFY	I don't want to hurt you.
WILLOW	Not a problem.
BUFFY	I said I didn't want to.
XANDER	I'm getting you out of here.
JONATHAN	What about Willow?
XANDER	Buffy can handle her.
DAWN	Are you sure?
XANDER	No - that's why we're leaving. Come on!
ANYA	I have to stay to keep the spell going on Willow.
XANDER	But...
ANYA	Do something right.
WILLOW	No!
BUFFY	(to guys) Go!
WILLOW	So. Here we are.
BUFFY	Are we really gonna do this?
WILLOW	Come on! This is a huge deal for me! Six years as a side man, and now I get to be the Slayer.
BUFFY	A killer isn't a Slayer. Being a Slayer means something you can't conceive of.
WILLOW	Oh, Buffy. You really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked.
BUFFY	Then show me what you got. And I'll show you what a Slayer is.
WILLOW	Get off, super bitch.
BUFFY	I can help you stop.
WILLOW	I thought you were gonna show me what a Slayer was.
ANYA	HELP ME!
WILLOW	Can't block my spells if you can't chant. And you can't chant if you're sleepin'...
ANDREW	Where are you taking us?
DAWN	Someplace safe.
JONATHAN	Like where?
DAWN	Xander?
XANDER	I don't know.
WILLOW	Buffy, I gotta tell you - I get it now. The Slayer thing really isn't about the violence.
GILES	I'd like to test that theory.

ANYA	Everything on this table's half off! Including the table! Buy one eyeball, get the second one free!
XANDER	Arhhh! Careful, me mateys! These be fire flies spat from a volcano off the coast of Katmandu. Arhhh!
KID	You're not a real pirate. Real pirates live on boats and don't look stupid.
XANDER	Arhhh! A salty swab, eh? Maybe you be fishin' for a taste... of me hook!
GILES	Hello! Ahab! A little help?
XANDER	And help ye shall have! Arhhh!
DAWN	So what are you supposed to be?
ANYA	An angel.
DAWN	Oh. Shouldn't you have wings?
ANYA	This is a special kind of angel, called a "Charlie". We don't have wings. We just skate around with perfect hair, fighting crime. Where's your costume?
DAWN	Like I'm six years old. Halloween's so lame.
ANYA	But you get to dress up and play games! Xander's gonna teach me a new one after work called Shiver Me Timbers. You ever play?
TARA	Dawn, Willow could use some help in magical texts.
DAWN	I'm all over it.
ANYA	What about you? Ever play Shiver Me Timbers?
TARA	Not really much for the timber.
WILLOW	All I'm saying is you might want to rethink the stereotype before someone turns you into a toad.
DAWN	Don't stop the invective on account of me.
WILLOW	If I see one more idiot that thinks witches are all hairy moles and rotten teeth...
POO	Do you have candy corn?
WILLOW	Aw, look at you! Aren't you just the cutest little thing!
DAWN	But I thought you said --
WILLOW	I know, but -- look, with the nose and the hat and -- aww! Come on. Let's fill that tummy up with sugary nibblets!
ANYA	Buffy, we're running low on Mandrake root. Check the basement!
BUFFY	Okay, but don't blame me if we have this same conversation over and...
BUFFY	... over and over and --
SPIKE	Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
BUFFY	What are you doing lurking down here?
SPIKE	Why does everyone always think I'm lurking about?
BUFFY	I don't know. Could it have something to do with the lurking ?
SPIKE	Came through the tunnels. Running low on Burba weed. Stir it in with the blood, makes it all hot and spicy.
I	mean, no, I was gonna nick it. 'Cause that's what I do. I go where I please and take what I want and what's your excuse anyway? Thought you had it to the brim with customer disservice.
BUFFY	One time deal to help out. And I mean straight time -- no loop de loop mummy hand repeato vision. Where's the Mandrake root?
SPIKE	Three to a jar. They tend to go a bit wonky if you cram 'em too close.
BUFFY	Thanks.
SPIKE	Feel like a bit of the rough and tumble?
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Me. You. Patrolling? Hello?
BUFFY	Oh, uh... I should stay. These Mandrake roots aren't gonna get up the stairs themselves.
SPIKE	Might if you let them out.
BUFFY	Maybe tomorrow night, okay?
SPIKE	Not like I don't already have plans. Great Pumpkin's on in twenty.
BUFFY	So much easier to talk to when he just wanted to kill me.
ANYA	Go help Giles!
BUFFY	What happened to Xander?
GILES	He kept poking me with his hook. I sent him over to charmed objects. With any luck he'll poke the wrong one and end up in a parallel dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles who squashes annoying, teeny pirates. We've got a ton of bagging here. If you could start over here and -
BUFFY	Actually, Spike had this really good idea about patrolling --
GILES	Buffy, you've been out patrolling every night this week. Besides, it's Halloween. The one time a year supernatural threats give it a well- deserved rest. As should you.
BUFFY	But what about costumes taking over your personality or wee little Irish fear demony thingies?
GILES	Yes, well, if anything calamitous is going to happen tonight, history suggests it will happen to us.
BUFFY	So maybe I should patrol to avoid trouble and - I'm bagging.
KALTENBACH	Da da da da da-da-da-da, happy Hallowe-en, Give you something special this year, da da da-da da!
DAWN	Come again...
XANDER	Store go boom. Arh.
ANYA	That was... that was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced.
BUFFY	Tomorrow?
ANYA	Post holiday clearance! The cornerstone of retail!
GILES	Brooms all around, then?
WILLOW	Or I could whip up a jaunty self- cleaning incantation. It'll be just like Fantasia.
GILES	Yes, and we all know how splendidly that turned out for Mickey.
WILLOW	Think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse.
TARA	And you have more fingers. Which is good, cause -- hey, no need to wear those big white gloves to overcompensate.
BUFFY	You know if you had a real peg leg, you wouldn't just have a lame costume. You'd actually be lame, which is a whole other--
DAWN	You do this every night?
ANYA	After I close out the register. The dance of capitalist superiority!
XANDER	I'm gonna marry that girl.
BUFFY	Xander! She's fifteen! And my sister, so don't even -- Oh.
XANDER	Hey, everybody! Can I, uh, there's something Anya and I want to tell you.
ANYA	Now ?
XANDER	Now. We're getting married.
DAWN	Oh my God!
TARA	Congratulations!
WILLOW	That's -- that's... wow.
XANDER	Big wow.
ANYA	I thought you were waiting for the right moment?
XANDER	I did.
ANYA	Here, have some money.
BUFFY	Did you know about this?
GILES	No. Unless I blocked it from my memory, much as I will Xander's vigorous use of his tongue.
BUFFY	Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we're doing?
GILES	Reveal my secret to no one.
BUFFY	Giles, this is -- We have to do something...
ANYA	...and he said he couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me and then he gave me this!
XANDER	Which I'll be paying for the rest of my life with her.
DAWN	Can I try it on?
ANYA	Oh, absolutely not!
GILES	Where I come from this sort of thing requires much in the way of libation.
XANDER	God save the Queen!
BUFFY	Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy. You kind of caught us with our parties down.
ANYA	That's all right. This is just the first premarital celebration. We'll have lots more. With gifts!
TARA	Sure. Maybe we'll even have time to decorate for the next one.
WILLOW	Why wait?
WILLOW	Karzaritate tamae. WILLOW Adorn with happiness.
ANYA	This is so much better than the way it usually looks. Thank you!
TARA	The grocery store's still open. We could have bought decorations.
WILLOW	Why bother? These are perfect -- and extra biodegradeably. In a couple of hours -- poof!
TARA	No, they're -- they're great. It's just... why use magic when you can do something naturally?
WILLOW	You can also fight monsters "naturally" with sticks and stones. Don't really recommend it, though.
TARA	That's different.
WILLOW	How?
TARA	Because -- because you're protecting people. Keeping them from being hurt.
WILLOW	Which makes them happy. Like pretty decorations made Anya happy.
TARA	That's not the point, Will.
WILLOW	Why are you being like this?
TARA	This isn't about me.
WILLOW	This is so about you. You're always coming down on me for doing magic that couldn't hurt a fly. What's your problem?
TARA	Willow, I j-just want you to stop and think about what you're --
DAWN	Sorry. Just checking on the chips.
WILLOW	It's okay. We're done.
BUFFY	You're getting married. You .
XANDER	Me. Choking.
BUFFY	Seems like just yesterday you couldn't pay a girl to date you.
XANDER	Like I'd ever pay -- Define "date".
BUFFY	I'm out of commission for three months and you... How many other things have changed since I've been away?
DAWN	I got a tattoo.
BUFFY	What?!
WILLOW	And that's why we told her she couldn't.
DAWN	Just a little one?
BUFFY	Over my dead body. The kind that doesn't come back.
DAWN	Fine.
XANDER	Almost as lucky as me.
DAWN	See you guys tomorrow.
BUFFY	Tomorrow?
DAWN	Yeah. I'm spending the night at Janice's, remember?
BUFFY	Wait -- that's tonight?
DAWN	No, it's on the other Halloween. Come on, you said I could.
BUFFY	Yeah, okay, I know, but now with Xander's party --
XANDER	We're good. But you'll have to cough up extra gifts at the reception.
ANYA	Yes, please!
BUFFY	I don't know. Giles. . .?
GILES	It's really not up to me.
DAWN	Come on. It's four blocks. I'll walk straight over. Not like I'm gonna be roaming the streets. Please?
DAWN	Hello?
GUY	Hey!
GIRL	Perv!
DAWN	Sorry! I thought, uh --
JANICE	Hey, Summers. Get an eyeful of the grope-fest? Maybe you are a perv.
GIRL	Bite me!
JANICE	You get over the wall okay.
DAWN	Yeah. My sister thinks I'm staying at your house.
JANICE	The Mominator thinks I'm at yours. Can't believe they fell for that one. Like, own a TV?
DAWN	So where are we meeting?
JANICE	The park. That's where all the monsters gather on Halloween...
ZACK	Hoo hoo hoo! To infinity and --
JUSTIN	Oops.
JANICE	Nice shot.
ZACK	Hey, baby! What took ya?
JANICE	Had to stop for crimes and misdemeanors.
ZACK	Hell-o!
JUSTIN	Hey. Justin.
DAWN	I know. I've seen you around at a couple of parties.
JUSTIN	I've seen you too.
GLENN	Hey, catch you guys later!
ZACK	Alone at last.
JANICE	So what do you want to do?
ZACK	Yeah! Three-points! Whoo!
DAWN	Witches don't really look like that.
JUSTIN	Got a lot of witch friends?
DAWN	No, I mean, from what I've read and stuff. Some of them are supposed to be really pretty, and boy you don't want to get them mad, 'cause --
ZACK	New target! Come on!
JANICE	So?
DAWN	He's okay.
JANICE	"Ho hum" okay or "oh-my-god-I'm-gonna- pee-my-pants" okay?
DAWN	Pee!
ZACK	So what's the verdict, cap'n? Is wittle Justin in love?
JUSTIN	I don't know. She's cute.
ZACK	Congratulations for having eyeballs. But what about, you know -- going all the way? You think --
JANICE	We done with the juvie crap yet? 'Cause, hey! Bored!
ZACK	Just one more.
GILES	Anya's a wonderful former vengeance demon. I'm sure you'll enjoy many years of non-hell dimensional bliss.
XANDER	Uh ...
GILES	You know with your combined incomes you may want to look into a down payment on a house.
XANDER	The kind you live in?
GILES	No rush. I'm sure you have enough to think about, what with the wedding arrangements and such. You have the rest of your lives to plan the rest of your lives.
XANDER	Yeah, yeah. Rest of our lives...
GILES	Well. If you need any help sorting through it all...
JANICE	No way! You know who lives here?
JUSTIN	Old Man Kaltenbach.
ZACK	Crusty old bastard.
DAWN	Isn't he supposed to be, like, mental?
ZACK	Total looney tunes. Pumpkins. Very dangerous. You go first.
JANICE	Screw that.
ZACK	Come on, show us how brave you are. Let's see those cute little girly guts!
JUSTIN	Lay off, man. If she doesn't want --
DAWN	I'll do it.
ZACK	Go, Dawn!
JUSTIN	Look, you don't have to --
DAWN	It's okay. I want to.
KALTENBACH	Shouldn't oughta mess with those. Sometimes they bite.
JUSTIN	Get away from her!
ZACK	Don't make me go kung-fu on you, man!
KALTENBACH	Come on in, kids. Got something special for you.
ZACK	Cool!
JANICE	We are so not going in there. Dawn, tell them.
ZACK	Dude, where'd you get the cool toys?
KALTENBACH	Used to design 'em, back in fifty- eight. Nothin' I loved more than to see a child's face light up when he opened one of mine on a Christmas or a birthday. I was good. Jeepers, I was the best .
JUSTIN	Uh -- Sally's not much for the cookin'. Why don't I give you a hand?
KALTENBACH	Hands are good. Always use more hands.
JANICE	Okay, can we get the funk out of here before Satan Claus stuffs us down a chimney?
ZACK	What, and miss the big treat? That'd break the old guy's wittle heart. Assuming it's still beating.
DAWN	She's right. We should just get Justin and go.
ZACK	Come on, the dude's a thousand years old. What's he gonna do? Drown us in his drool cup?
DAWN	Hey. Where's its head?
JUSTIN	Boo.
JANICE	What the hell was that?
DAWN	Justin? Justin --
JUSTIN	Let's go!
DAWN	What happened?
JUSTIN	I swiped his wallet when he wasn't looking! Come on!
DAWN	Oh my god oh my god oh my god...
JUSTIN	Dude, that guy was rank!
ZACK	Bet a spritz of Dawn'll wash that right out. So what do you think? Lunchables... or do we go all the way and turn 'em?
ANYA	... I thought maybe a June wedding, but then I remembered they always prompted the largest percentage of calls for vengeance, so now I'm leaning towards as soon as damn possible. Mortal life being so short, we gotta cram in as much marital bliss as we can before we wither and die. There's just so much to consider. The wedding, new cars, a house, and babies! You have to plan for babies or they'll just run roughshod over your entire existence.
XANDER	Yeah, gotta decide what to call 'em before they hit college.
GILES	"Rupert" is an exceptionally strong name.
ANYA	Yes. If we want our progeny to eat paste and have their lunch money stolen.
BUFFY	The important thing is you're happy. Everything else is thick gravy goodness.
ANYA	I know. I'm the luckiest ex-demon in the world. To be able to find the one person in all dimensions that I was meant to be with... and have everything work out just the way I dreamed. How often does the universe allow that to happen?
XANDER	Air! Sweet mother oxygen!
BUFFY	You okay?
XANDER	Yeah, I just...
BUFFY	But it's a good thing, right? This is love and celebration and moving forward. Anya's right. This is the way life's supposed to work out.
XANDER	Right. Deep pools of ooey delight. I'm wallowing. Not drowning.
BUFFY	Definite wallow action.
XANDER	Okay. Once more into the breach?
BUFFY	My breaches are wearing a little thin. Think maybe I'll swing by Spike's, take him up on that patrol. Gotta be something out there trolling for a smackdown.
JUSTIN	So, you're like what, a sophomore?
DAWN	I wish.
JUSTIN	Ouhh! Freshman!
DAWN	Yep. Way down there at the bottom of the rung. Actually kinda down under those little rubber feet that keep the ladder steady.
JUSTIN	Those are important.
DAWN	I did?
JUSTIN	Yeah. For keeping me steady.
DAWN	You're a little late. I steal all the time.
JUSTIN	Really?
DAWN	Totally. I haven't paid for a lipstick since forever.
JUSTIN	Be still my heart. Cute and bad?
DAWN	Bad to the bone.
JUSTIN	More like frozen. Here...
DAWN	Thanks.
JUSTIN	My pleasure, Miss Summers.
JANICE	Hey. Where's Zack?
JUSTIN	He went to get the car.
DAWN	You guys got a car?
GILES	Summers' residence. Oh, yes, Mrs. Penshaw, how -- No, Dawn told us she was spending the night at your house. Yes. Yes, I realize that now, but I don't believe you called to check either. All right -- yes, let's just -- If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
WILLOW	Hey, we were just gettin' our funk on.
GILES	That was Janice's mother. Apparently Janice told her she was spending the night here .
XANDER	Dipping into the classics. Gotta respect that.
GILES	Is Buffy still outside?
XANDER	No, she was feeling antsy, went to grab Spike for a patrol.
GILES	Always nice to be in the loop. Xander, Anya -- stay here in case Mrs. Penshaw calls. Willow, Tara, check downtown. I'll swing by Spike's and see if I can catch Buffy.
TARA	Deja Dawn.
WILLOW	Just typical teen stuff. I'm sure she's fine. Not like there's a Hellgod out there trying to drain her blood this time, right?
ZACK	Don't do nothin' I would, dude.
JANICE	You're it.
ZACK	Love it when they run.
DAWN	So.
JUSTIN	Yeah.
DAWN	It's cold. You okay? You want this back.
JUSTIN	Nah. Cold doesn't really bother me.
DAWN	What are you, Superman?
JUSTIN	No. But I do have a few special powers...
DAWN	Hey, does this work?
JUSTIN	You gotta turn the ignition.
DAWN	I love this one.
JUSTIN	Another thing we have in common.
DAWN	It's... cold.
JUSTIN	Do you want to go?
DAWN	No, I just... you know, what do you expect --
JUSTIN	Shhh.
DAWN	Shiver me timbers.
JUSTIN	What?
DAWN	Uh, nothing, just... wow.
JUSTIN	Oh my God. That was your first.
DAWN	Wha --no!
JUSTIN	It was! That was your first kiss.
DAWN	I've been kissed before. I kiss all the time. Not that I'm a kiss slut, but, you know, I'm just saying with the lips and the pressing together and stuff -- hey, expert here.
JUSTIN	It was perfect.
WILLOW	Do they know they're brother and sister?
TARA	You think she's here?
WILLOW	What?
TARA	Do you think Dawn might have come here?
WILLOW	It's where I'd be if I were sixteen and on the lam.
TARA	Really?
WILLOW	Well, not me at sixteen, 'cause, hello -- spaz.
TARA	You?
WILLOW	Hard to believe such a hot mama yama came from such humble, bad hat- wearing, geek-infested roots.
TARA	Infested roots. Trying to turn me on?
WILLOW	I have to try?
TARA	Do you see her?
WILLOW	No, there's too many people.
TARA	Maybe we could ask security to --
WILLOW	It'll take too long.
TARA	What are you doing? Will -
WILLOW	I'm just going to clear the crowd.
TARA	How?
WILLOW	I'll shift everyone that's not a sixteen-year-old girl into an alternate dimension.
TARA	What?!
WILLOW	It'll just be for a fraction of a second. They won't even notice.
TARA	Will, no! You can't!
WILLOW	Why?
TARA	What if something goes wrong?
WILLOW	It won't.
TARA	But w-what would Giles say?
WILLOW	Sukut! WILLOW (English translation) Quiet!
WILLOW	So you're taking his side now?
TARA	This isn't about sides.
WILLOW	Have you two been talking about me behind my back?
TARA	No, God --
WILLOW	You know how that makes me feel?
TARA	Willow, you're using too much magic. What do you want me to do? Just sit back and keep my mouth shut?
WILLOW	That'd be a good start.
TARA	If I didn't love you so damn much, I would.
WILLOW	Tara --
JUSTIN	Mmm... you taste so good. . .
DAWN	Ow.
JUSTIN	Sorry.
DAWN	It's okay. Long as it's not bleeding.
JUSTIN	Sorry. It's just. . . God, you are so beautiful . . .
BUFFY	Get your gear together, we need to --
SPIKE	Ahhh!
BUFFY	Good thing you're uncivilized. We've got trouble.
SPIKE	Giles found you?
BUFFY	Giles? No, is he looking for me?
SPIKE	Yeah. It's Dawn --
BUFFY	What happened? Is she all right?
SPIKE	No, it's okay. Giles came by earlier looking for you. Dawn and her little friend pulled a Houdini. Up to a bit of candy corn mischief, I suspect.
BUFFY	Wait, Dawn's running around out there somewhere?
SPIKE	Kid's these days, eh? I just did a sweep of the tunnels. Giles is poking about the cemetery --
BUFFY	We have to find her.
SPIKE	Don't think she's in there.
GILES	Mist. Cemetery. Halloween. This should end well.
GILES	Dawn!
JANICE	He bit me! That jerk bit me!
GILES	I'm fairly certain she wasn't.
ZACK	What do you know about it, grandpa?
GILES	Quite a bit, actually.
ZACK	Dude, that sucks.
GILES	Dawn. . . where's Dawn. . .
DAWN	Get off of me!
JUSTIN	Dawn, wait! Wait!
DAWN	Hang out?
JUSTIN	Yeah, I mean, you're not like the other girls. They're boring and stupid and you're. . . you're different. There's something special about you. I knew it the first time I saw you.
DAWN	Giles --
GILES	I'll give you a choice, son. We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the - -
JUSTIN	What were my choices again?
SPIKE	This a private game, or can anyone have a go?
BUFFY	Dawn! Are you --
DAWN	I didn't know he was dead!
JUSTIN	Living dead.
DAWN	Shut up.
BUFFY	How could you not know?
DAWN	I just met him.
BUFFY	So you were parked in the woods with a boy you just met?
JUSTIN	We've seen each other at parties--
BUFFY	Shut up. I can't believe you.
DAWN	Oh like you've never fallen for a vampire.
BUFFY	That was different.
DAWN	It always is when it's you.
CARL	Uh ... can we fight now?
BUFFY	Didn't any of you come here just to make out?
BUFFY	Been there, done that.
JUSTIN	Your sister's the Slayer? I totally get that. I knew there was something special about you.
BUFFY	Giles!
CARL	What's your malfunction, man!
SPIKE	It's Halloween, you nit! We take the night off. Those are the rules.
CARL	Me and mine don't follow no stinking rules. We're rebels!
SPIKE	No, I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.
JUSTIN	Trick or treat!
DAWN	I thought you really liked me.
JUSTIN	I do. And you like me, too.
DAWN	I do.
BUFFY	Sorry about the party.
XANDER	Don't worry about it.
ANYA	It gave me time to plan the bridal shower. Where do we order obscenely muscular male strippers?
XANDER	Ahn.
ANYA	Kidding. Jeez. We'll talk.
SPIKE	Guess I should bugger off. Something about Big Bad's not venturing far from their crypts on Halloween?
BUFFY	Good fight.
WILLOW	So, big monster mashing. Sorry we missed it.
TARA	As long as Dawn's all right.
WILLOW	Yeah, I mean that's --
TARA	I think I'm gonna turn in. Good night.
WILLOW	Tara . . .
BUFFY	How's the face?
GILES	Still ruggedly handsome. Grandpa, indeed.
BUFFY	She's taking it pretty hard.
GILES	Not surprising. Still, we can't ignore this kind of behavior. Something has to be done before it spins out of control.
BUFFY	You're right. I'm glad you're here to sort it out. Don't be too hard on her, okay?
GILES	We need to have a conversation.
DAWN	This the part where you tell me you're not angry, just disappointed?
GILES	Pretty much. Except for the bit about not being angry.
WILLOW	I'm sorry. Okay?
TARA	It's not that easy.
WILLOW	What do you want me to do? Reverse time and take it back? 'Cause I might be able to if I --
TARA	Can we not do this now? I'm tired.
WILLOW	Okay.
WILLOW	Let's just forget about it.
WILLOW	(softly, in Latin) Obliviscere. WILLOW (English translation) Forget.
TARA	Ouhh, you're feet are cold.
WILLOW	Better warm me up.
TARA	Mmm. Now that's the way a day should always end. And start. And all the stuff in the middle.
WILLOW	So. . . you're not mad?
TARA	About what?
XANDER	Arhhh! Careful, me mateys! These be fire flies spat from a volcano off the coast of Katmandu. Arhhh!
KID	You're not a real pirate. Real pirates live on boats and don't look stupid.
XANDER	Arhhh! A salty swab, eh? Maybe you be fishin' for a taste... of me hook!
GILES	Hello! Ahab! A little help?
XANDER	And help ye shall have! Arhhh!
DAWN	So what are you supposed to be?
ANYA	An angel.
DAWN	Oh. Shouldn't you have wings?
ANYA	This is a special kind of angel, called a "Charlie". We don't have wings. We just skate around with perfect hair, fighting crime. Where's your costume?
DAWN	Like I'm six years old. Halloween's so lame.
ANYA	But you get to dress up and play games! Xander's gonna teach me a new one after work called Shiver Me Timbers. You ever play?
TARA	Dawn, Willow could use some help in magical texts.
DAWN	I'm all over it.
ANYA	What about you? Ever play Shiver Me Timbers?
TARA	Not really much for the timber.
DAWN	Don't stop the invective on account of me.
WILLOW	If I see one more idiot that thinks witches are all hairy moles and rotten teeth...
WILLOW	Aw, look at you! Aren't you just the cutest little thing!
DAWN	But I thought you said --
WILLOW	I know, but -- look, with the nose and the hat and -- aww! Come on. Let's fill that tummy up with sugary nibblets!
SPIKE	Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
BUFFY	What are you doing lurking down here?
SPIKE	Why does everyone always think I'm lurking about?
BUFFY	I don't know. Could it have something to do with the lurking ?
I	mean, no, I was gonna nick it. 'Cause that's what I do. I go where I please and take what I want and what's your excuse anyway? Thought you had it to the brim with customer disservice.
BUFFY	One time deal to help out. And I mean straight time -- no loop de loop mummy hand repeato vision. Where's the Mandrake root?
SPIKE	Three to a jar. They tend to go a bit wonky if you cram 'em too close.
BUFFY	Thanks.
SPIKE	Feel like a bit of the rough and tumble?
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Me. You. Patrolling? Hello?
BUFFY	Oh, uh... I should stay. These Mandrake roots aren't gonna get up the stairs themselves.
SPIKE	Might if you let them out.
BUFFY	Maybe tomorrow night, okay?
SPIKE	Not like I don't already have plans. Great Pumpkin's on in twenty.
BUFFY	What happened to Xander?
GILES	He kept poking me with his hook. I sent him over to charmed objects. With any luck he'll poke the wrong one and end up in a parallel dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles who squashes annoying, teeny pirates. We've got a ton of bagging here. If you could start over here and -
BUFFY	Actually, Spike had this really good idea about patrolling --
GILES	Buffy, you've been out patrolling every night this week. Besides, it's Halloween. The one time a year supernatural threats give it a well- deserved rest. As should you.
BUFFY	But what about costumes taking over your personality or wee little Irish fear demony thingies?
GILES	Yes, well, if anything calamitous is going to happen tonight, history suggests it will happen to us.
BUFFY	So maybe I should patrol to avoid trouble and - I'm bagging.
XANDER	Store go boom. Arh.
ANYA	That was... that was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced.
BUFFY	Tomorrow?
ANYA	Post holiday clearance! The cornerstone of retail!
GILES	Brooms all around, then?
WILLOW	Or I could whip up a jaunty self- cleaning incantation. It'll be just like Fantasia.
GILES	Yes, and we all know how splendidly that turned out for Mickey.
WILLOW	Think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse.
TARA	And you have more fingers. Which is good, cause -- hey, no need to wear those big white gloves to overcompensate.
DAWN	You do this every night?
ANYA	After I close out the register. The dance of capitalist superiority!
XANDER	I'm gonna marry that girl.
BUFFY	Xander! She's fifteen! And my sister, so don't even -- Oh.
XANDER	Hey, everybody! Can I, uh, there's something Anya and I want to tell you.
ANYA	Now ?
XANDER	Now. We're getting married.
DAWN	Oh my God!
TARA	Congratulations!
WILLOW	That's -- that's... wow.
XANDER	Big wow.
ANYA	I thought you were waiting for the right moment?
XANDER	I did.
BUFFY	Did you know about this?
GILES	No. Unless I blocked it from my memory, much as I will Xander's vigorous use of his tongue.
BUFFY	Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we're doing?
GILES	Reveal my secret to no one.
XANDER	Which I'll be paying for the rest of my life with her.
DAWN	Can I try it on?
ANYA	Oh, absolutely not!
GILES	Where I come from this sort of thing requires much in the way of libation.
XANDER	God save the Queen!
BUFFY	Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy. You kind of caught us with our parties down.
ANYA	That's all right. This is just the first premarital celebration. We'll have lots more. With gifts!
TARA	Sure. Maybe we'll even have time to decorate for the next one.
WILLOW	Why wait?
TARA	The grocery store's still open. We could have bought decorations.
WILLOW	Why bother? These are perfect -- and extra biodegradeably. In a couple of hours -- poof!
TARA	No, they're -- they're great. It's just... why use magic when you can do something naturally?
WILLOW	You can also fight monsters "naturally" with sticks and stones. Don't really recommend it, though.
TARA	That's different.
WILLOW	How?
TARA	Because -- because you're protecting people. Keeping them from being hurt.
WILLOW	Which makes them happy. Like pretty decorations made Anya happy.
TARA	That's not the point, Will.
WILLOW	Why are you being like this?
TARA	This isn't about me.
WILLOW	This is so about you. You're always coming down on me for doing magic that couldn't hurt a fly. What's your problem?
TARA	Willow, I j-just want you to stop and think about what you're --
DAWN	Sorry. Just checking on the chips.
WILLOW	It's okay. We're done.
BUFFY	You're getting married. You .
XANDER	Me. Choking.
BUFFY	Seems like just yesterday you couldn't pay a girl to date you.
XANDER	Like I'd ever pay -- Define "date".
DAWN	I got a tattoo.
BUFFY	What?!
WILLOW	And that's why we told her she couldn't.
DAWN	Just a little one?
BUFFY	Over my dead body. The kind that doesn't come back.
DAWN	Fine.
XANDER	Almost as lucky as me.
DAWN	See you guys tomorrow.
BUFFY	Tomorrow?
DAWN	Yeah. I'm spending the night at Janice's, remember?
BUFFY	Wait -- that's tonight?
DAWN	No, it's on the other Halloween. Come on, you said I could.
BUFFY	Yeah, okay, I know, but now with Xander's party --
XANDER	We're good. But you'll have to cough up extra gifts at the reception.
ANYA	Yes, please!
BUFFY	I don't know. Giles. . .?
GILES	It's really not up to me.
DAWN	Come on. It's four blocks. I'll walk straight over. Not like I'm gonna be roaming the streets. Please?
GUY	Hey!
GIRL	Perv!
DAWN	Sorry! I thought, uh --
JANICE	Hey, Summers. Get an eyeful of the grope-fest? Maybe you are a perv.
GIRL	Bite me!
JANICE	You get over the wall okay.
DAWN	Yeah. My sister thinks I'm staying at your house.
JANICE	The Mominator thinks I'm at yours. Can't believe they fell for that one. Like, own a TV?
DAWN	So where are we meeting?
JANICE	The park. That's where all the monsters gather on Halloween...
JUSTIN	Oops.
JANICE	Nice shot.
ZACK	Hey, baby! What took ya?
JANICE	Had to stop for crimes and misdemeanors.
GLENN	Hey, catch you guys later!
ZACK	Alone at last.
JANICE	So what do you want to do?
DAWN	Witches don't really look like that.
JUSTIN	Got a lot of witch friends?
DAWN	No, I mean, from what I've read and stuff. Some of them are supposed to be really pretty, and boy you don't want to get them mad, 'cause --
JANICE	So?
DAWN	He's okay.
JANICE	"Ho hum" okay or "oh-my-god-I'm-gonna- pee-my-pants" okay?
DAWN	Pee!
JUSTIN	I don't know. She's cute.
ZACK	Congratulations for having eyeballs. But what about, you know -- going all the way? You think --
JANICE	We done with the juvie crap yet? 'Cause, hey! Bored!
XANDER	Uh ...
GILES	You know with your combined incomes you may want to look into a down payment on a house.
XANDER	The kind you live in?
GILES	No rush. I'm sure you have enough to think about, what with the wedding arrangements and such. You have the rest of your lives to plan the rest of your lives.
XANDER	Yeah, yeah. Rest of our lives...
GILES	Well. If you need any help sorting through it all...
JANICE	No way! You know who lives here?
JUSTIN	Old Man Kaltenbach.
ZACK	Crusty old bastard.
DAWN	Isn't he supposed to be, like, mental?
ZACK	Total looney tunes. Pumpkins. Very dangerous. You go first.
JANICE	Screw that.
ZACK	Come on, show us how brave you are. Let's see those cute little girly guts!
JUSTIN	Lay off, man. If she doesn't want --
DAWN	I'll do it.
ZACK	Go, Dawn!
JUSTIN	Look, you don't have to --
DAWN	It's okay. I want to.
JUSTIN	Get away from her!
ZACK	Don't make me go kung-fu on you, man!
ZACK	Cool!
JANICE	We are so not going in there. Dawn, tell them.
ZACK	Dude, where'd you get the cool toys?
KALTENBACH	Used to design 'em, back in fifty- eight. Nothin' I loved more than to see a child's face light up when he opened one of mine on a Christmas or a birthday. I was good. Jeepers, I was the best .
JUSTIN	Uh -- Sally's not much for the cookin'. Why don't I give you a hand?
KALTENBACH	Hands are good. Always use more hands.
ZACK	What, and miss the big treat? That'd break the old guy's wittle heart. Assuming it's still beating.
DAWN	She's right. We should just get Justin and go.
ZACK	Come on, the dude's a thousand years old. What's he gonna do? Drown us in his drool cup?
JUSTIN	Let's go!
DAWN	What happened?
JUSTIN	Dude, that guy was rank!
ZACK	Bet a spritz of Dawn'll wash that right out. So what do you think? Lunchables... or do we go all the way and turn 'em?
XANDER	Yeah, gotta decide what to call 'em before they hit college.
GILES	"Rupert" is an exceptionally strong name.
ANYA	Yes. If we want our progeny to eat paste and have their lunch money stolen.
BUFFY	The important thing is you're happy. Everything else is thick gravy goodness.
XANDER	Air! Sweet mother oxygen!
BUFFY	You okay?
XANDER	Yeah, I just...
BUFFY	But it's a good thing, right? This is love and celebration and moving forward. Anya's right. This is the way life's supposed to work out.
XANDER	Right. Deep pools of ooey delight. I'm wallowing. Not drowning.
BUFFY	Definite wallow action.
XANDER	Okay. Once more into the breach?
BUFFY	My breaches are wearing a little thin. Think maybe I'll swing by Spike's, take him up on that patrol. Gotta be something out there trolling for a smackdown.
JUSTIN	So, you're like what, a sophomore?
DAWN	I wish.
JUSTIN	Ouhh! Freshman!
DAWN	Yep. Way down there at the bottom of the rung. Actually kinda down under those little rubber feet that keep the ladder steady.
JUSTIN	Those are important.
DAWN	I did?
JUSTIN	Yeah. For keeping me steady.
DAWN	You're a little late. I steal all the time.
JUSTIN	Really?
DAWN	Totally. I haven't paid for a lipstick since forever.
JUSTIN	Be still my heart. Cute and bad?
DAWN	Bad to the bone.
JUSTIN	More like frozen. Here...
JANICE	Hey. Where's Zack?
JUSTIN	He went to get the car.
DAWN	You guys got a car?
WILLOW	Hey, we were just gettin' our funk on.
GILES	That was Janice's mother. Apparently Janice told her she was spending the night here .
XANDER	Dipping into the classics. Gotta respect that.
GILES	Is Buffy still outside?
XANDER	No, she was feeling antsy, went to grab Spike for a patrol.
GILES	Always nice to be in the loop. Xander, Anya -- stay here in case Mrs. Penshaw calls. Willow, Tara, check downtown. I'll swing by Spike's and see if I can catch Buffy.
TARA	Deja Dawn.
WILLOW	Just typical teen stuff. I'm sure she's fine. Not like there's a Hellgod out there trying to drain her blood this time, right?
DAWN	So.
JUSTIN	Yeah.
DAWN	It's cold. You okay? You want this back.
JUSTIN	Nah. Cold doesn't really bother me.
DAWN	What are you, Superman?
JUSTIN	No. But I do have a few special powers...
DAWN	I love this one.
JUSTIN	Another thing we have in common.
DAWN	It's... cold.
JUSTIN	Do you want to go?
DAWN	No, I just... you know, what do you expect --
JUSTIN	Shhh.
DAWN	Shiver me timbers.
JUSTIN	What?
DAWN	Uh, nothing, just... wow.
JUSTIN	Oh my God. That was your first.
DAWN	Wha --no!
JUSTIN	It was! That was your first kiss.
DAWN	I've been kissed before. I kiss all the time. Not that I'm a kiss slut, but, you know, I'm just saying with the lips and the pressing together and stuff -- hey, expert here.
WILLOW	Do they know they're brother and sister?
TARA	You think she's here?
WILLOW	What?
TARA	Do you think Dawn might have come here?
WILLOW	It's where I'd be if I were sixteen and on the lam.
TARA	Really?
WILLOW	Well, not me at sixteen, 'cause, hello -- spaz.
TARA	You?
WILLOW	Hard to believe such a hot mama yama came from such humble, bad hat- wearing, geek-infested roots.
TARA	Infested roots. Trying to turn me on?
WILLOW	I have to try?
TARA	Do you see her?
WILLOW	No, there's too many people.
TARA	Maybe we could ask security to --
WILLOW	It'll take too long.
TARA	What are you doing? Will -
WILLOW	I'm just going to clear the crowd.
TARA	How?
WILLOW	I'll shift everyone that's not a sixteen-year-old girl into an alternate dimension.
TARA	What?!
WILLOW	It'll just be for a fraction of a second. They won't even notice.
TARA	Will, no! You can't!
WILLOW	Why?
TARA	What if something goes wrong?
WILLOW	It won't.
TARA	But w-what would Giles say?
WILLOW	So you're taking his side now?
TARA	This isn't about sides.
WILLOW	Have you two been talking about me behind my back?
TARA	No, God --
WILLOW	You know how that makes me feel?
TARA	Willow, you're using too much magic. What do you want me to do? Just sit back and keep my mouth shut?
WILLOW	That'd be a good start.
DAWN	Ow.
JUSTIN	Sorry.
DAWN	It's okay. Long as it's not bleeding.
JUSTIN	Sorry. It's just. . . God, you are so beautiful . . .
SPIKE	Ahhh!
BUFFY	Good thing you're uncivilized. We've got trouble.
SPIKE	Giles found you?
BUFFY	Giles? No, is he looking for me?
SPIKE	Yeah. It's Dawn --
BUFFY	What happened? Is she all right?
SPIKE	No, it's okay. Giles came by earlier looking for you. Dawn and her little friend pulled a Houdini. Up to a bit of candy corn mischief, I suspect.
BUFFY	Wait, Dawn's running around out there somewhere?
SPIKE	Kid's these days, eh? I just did a sweep of the tunnels. Giles is poking about the cemetery --
BUFFY	We have to find her.
JANICE	He bit me! That jerk bit me!
GILES	I'm fairly certain she wasn't.
ZACK	What do you know about it, grandpa?
DAWN	Hang out?
JUSTIN	Yeah, I mean, you're not like the other girls. They're boring and stupid and you're. . . you're different. There's something special about you. I knew it the first time I saw you.
DAWN	I didn't know he was dead!
JUSTIN	Living dead.
DAWN	Shut up.
BUFFY	How could you not know?
DAWN	I just met him.
BUFFY	So you were parked in the woods with a boy you just met?
JUSTIN	We've seen each other at parties--
BUFFY	Shut up. I can't believe you.
DAWN	Oh like you've never fallen for a vampire.
BUFFY	That was different.
DAWN	It always is when it's you.
CARL	What's your malfunction, man!
SPIKE	It's Halloween, you nit! We take the night off. Those are the rules.
CARL	Me and mine don't follow no stinking rules. We're rebels!
SPIKE	No, I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.
DAWN	I thought you really liked me.
JUSTIN	I do. And you like me, too.
DAWN	I do.
BUFFY	Sorry about the party.
XANDER	Don't worry about it.
ANYA	It gave me time to plan the bridal shower. Where do we order obscenely muscular male strippers?
XANDER	Ahn.
ANYA	Kidding. Jeez. We'll talk.
SPIKE	Guess I should bugger off. Something about Big Bad's not venturing far from their crypts on Halloween?
BUFFY	Good fight.
WILLOW	So, big monster mashing. Sorry we missed it.
TARA	As long as Dawn's all right.
WILLOW	Yeah, I mean that's --
TARA	I think I'm gonna turn in. Good night.
BUFFY	How's the face?
GILES	Still ruggedly handsome. Grandpa, indeed.
BUFFY	She's taking it pretty hard.
GILES	Not surprising. Still, we can't ignore this kind of behavior. Something has to be done before it spins out of control.
BUFFY	You're right. I'm glad you're here to sort it out. Don't be too hard on her, okay?
GILES	We need to have a conversation.
DAWN	This the part where you tell me you're not angry, just disappointed?
GILES	Pretty much. Except for the bit about not being angry.
WILLOW	I'm sorry. Okay?
TARA	It's not that easy.
WILLOW	What do you want me to do? Reverse time and take it back? 'Cause I might be able to if I --
TARA	Can we not do this now? I'm tired.
WILLOW	Okay.
TARA	Ouhh, you're feet are cold.
WILLOW	Better warm me up.
TARA	Mmm. Now that's the way a day should always end. And start. And all the stuff in the middle.
WILLOW	So. . . you're not mad?
TARA	About what?

CLEM	Hey, you!
BUFFY	It's like these people have never seen an apocalypse before. And you're just out for a quick spin, right? Maybe out to the 7-11... in Nebraska...
CLEM	It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling it, getting crazier. And you can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic activity. Not that I... swing cats. Or eat... Nope. Cutting way back. Cholesterol. Morals. I mean morals.
BUFFY	Right.
CLEM	We've seen bad stuff in this town before, but, you know... this time, it's like, it just seems... different. More powerful. I don't think anyone's gonna be able to stop it -- I mean... I'm sure you're gonna do fine. Complete faith in you. If anyone can do it, you can, 'cause... you rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have a drink -- When! When, I mean! When you save the world. It's gonna be great! With the, you know... rocking...
BUFFY	Yeah. I probably should.
CLEM	You take care of yourself, okay?
GILES	Thank you, officer. I appreciate your help.
OFFICER	Thank you , Inspector. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so we're happy to help with anything you need. Is there anything else...?
WILLOW	No. Thank you. We're fine.
OFFICER	Right... because you're... wait... (creeping confusion) Who are...
WILLOW	I'm with the Inspector.
OFFICER	You're with the Inspector. Right. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol --
CITIZEN	A single step! A single step and it is upon us! It is nigh! From beneath you it --
MUNROE	Freakin' nutcase.
WILLOW	Ow.
OFFICER	People're acting up. Getting nuts. We do what we can, but our hands are kinda tied. I mean, man, let us know if you need help with your guy, cuz we're itchin' to hand out some justice .
WILLOW	He wasn't much of a threat...
OFFICER	And you're... wait...
GILES	We really ought to go catch that flight back to... Interpol...
WILLOW	Good idea. My control was fading. What's up with them?
GILES	Same thing as everyone else. Hellmouth is active again.
WILLOW	C'mon. I wanna get back to Xander.
MUNROE	Who was that?
OFFICER	I... I'm not sure.
DUNCAN	You get one 'a these yet?
OFFICER	What is it?
MUNROE	Fugitive. Ran to ground right here in our own back yard.
OFFICER	Yeah? Sounds like a situation needs some justice.
BUFFY	...and that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandage. Bruising around the... area. The, uh, musculature and bone structure took a heavy hit.
XANDER	Okay.
BUFFY	Also, the meds may cause some stomach discomfort, so we're gonna have to be, you know, careful. About your diet.
XANDER	Can't really taste anything, anyway. I keep waiting for all my other senses to improve by fifty percent, should kick in any day now.
BUFFY	And we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Once your labs are back. Doctor Kallet says they should be a couple hours.
XANDER	Great.
BUFFY	Okay, I think you're all caught up. (re: folder) Thanks for this, Willow. Great work.
WILLOW	Oh, but I thought we were gonna -- there were gonna be card games...
BUFFY	Yeah, you know, I should really get back. (re: folder again) I wanna get 'em working on this stuff. I think we're getting really close to something.
WILLOW	But --
XANDER	It's okay. Gotta be done. And maybe I'll see you tonight. Without any depth of field of course, but still...
WILLOW	So, you're stuck with me then, huh, let's get us some cherry-flavored off- brand gelatin, and then I think we're gonna be ready for a rousing game of --
XANDER	I'm gonna need a parrot.
WILLOW	Huh?
XANDER	To go with the eyepatch. You know. Complete the look. I think I still have that costume from Halloween...
WILLOW	Ahhh. Yes, well, don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. You know, the hospital can probably hook you up with a nice one, maybe they have a two-body-parts-for-one kinda deal.
XANDER	Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch Jaws 3-D again!
WILLOW	Right! Plus, you never have to...
XANDER	Willow.
ANYA	...so we know that a battle is coming. Ubervamps galore.
ANDREW	...Hard...to...
ANYA	But I've been out talking to my old contacts, and they've provided some surprising bits of news. Yay for them.
KENNEDY	Um... no.
ANYA	Oh. Right. But the heart thing is still good to know since holy water runs off these guys like they're scotch-guarded, and sunlight would work, but, guess what, they're not coming out during the day.
RONA	Okay, you know what? I used to be afraid of the ubervamp guys. Then the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm just mostly terrified of him.
KENNEDY	We saw him do stuff...
ANYA	Right, well, we're working on getting info on him, but in the meantime --
AMANDA	Why bother?
ANYA	Right, well...
KENNEDY	Got enough to share?
FAITH	I'll trade ya for a carton of cigarettes and some soap. Sorry. Habit.
KENNEDY	Probably.
FAITH	All right, playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique is probably a little different than what you're used to.
AMANDA	'Cause I really hope I don't have to study all that.
FAITH	Yeah, whenever she starts talkin' 'bout gettin' all sweaty with Xander like that, I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up. Might work less well for you guys.
KENNEDY	Thing is, what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't do a helluva lotta good when Preacher Man is out there ready to finish the job he started.
FAITH	No one's come up with any info yet about Caleb...?
AMANDA	No. Nothing is working, not research, not Anya's contacts...
KENNEDY	We're lousy with dead ends around here. Everyone's feeling pretty... pointless. We don't even have a place to start.
DAWN	Buffy! How's Xander?
BUFFY	He's doing really well, he's ready to come home, I think.
FAITH	Whatcha got?
BUFFY	Info Willow and Giles were able to get from the police database.
FAITH	Incidents of violence and vandalism connected to California religious institutions in the last ten years. Looks like this gives us a place to start.
BUFFY	Exactly. We start with California, if nothing turns up, we expand the search to other areas, but a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game, he's been playing for a while. We thought we'd try to find out where.
DAWN	So we look at recent events, see if anything smacks of Caleb's M.O.
BUFFY	Right. And if that doesn't work, we'll try something else. Whatever it takes. You okay to help?
DAWN	Well, I was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but, darn all the luck, that's when they cancelled school. So it turns out I got the time.
BUFFY	Good.
DAWN	Hey, now what was Xander's mood like, you know, exactly? 'Cause yesterday he seemed more resigned than morose, so I was wondering if he's trending upward still.
BUFFY	Okay.
FAITH	Hey, pipsqueak. Why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten from Giles?
DAWN	Fine. We can cross-reference all of this to Giles' files, see what we get. Plus, I could say "Giles' files" some more. I'll be right back.
BUFFY	Okay. So we're looking for anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring...
KENNEDY	His ability to render a Slayer useless in just one punch...
BUFFY	It's okay. You know, I gotta get to the school anyway, pick up the rest of my stuff.
KENNEDY	I really didn't mean to --
BUFFY	It's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, doesn't... isn't Anya doing a thing for you guys today?
KENNEDY	Yeah, we were... we should probably head down there now.
BUFFY	Okay, I'll be back soon. See if you can get everyone started on this stuff in the meantime.
CALEB	Ain't that just like a woman?
BUFFY	Get out of here.
CALEB	Now, now, little girl. Manners. Though I do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours has inflamed many a man. Weak as they are.
BUFFY	You get near Xander again, I will end you.
CALEB	Mind your manners . I believe I did warn you once.
CALEB	You're angry. Frustrated. Scared. I like that in a girl.
BUFFY	Just ornery, I guess.
CALEB	I knew you'd be a wild one.
CALEB	See you soon, little lady.
GILES	Show me what you have.
DAWN	Not much. Most of these places were hit by run-of-the-mill vandalism. Basic B-and-E, money stolen, sometimes colorful language painted on the doors. Did you notice how I just kinda threw B-and-E in there? It's a law enforcement term.
GILES	Yes. Yes, excellent work. Very proud.
DAWN	Here's the one that stood out. It's a mission up north in Gilroy.
ANDREW	Um, Mr. Giles? Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella flavored Hot Pocket out of the freezer even though I had called dibs on it.
GILES	I don't see anything.
DAWN	Exactly. No vandalism at all.
GILES	Then why is it in the file?
DAWN	Place was abandoned. Locals started realizing after a few days no one was going in or out. Six members of the order lived there, when the cops showed up... all gone. Unsolved.
ANDREW	Yup. See, the post-it's still there, "Andrew's, please do not eat," but the box is empty now.
GILES	Oh.
DAWN	Oh? Oh, good?
GILES	Not sure. Here...
ANDREW	See, it's not the Hot Pocket itself that matters, even though it had the new-and-improved thicker tomato sauce, it's just the fundamental lack of respect.
GILES	Shhhhhh. Pay attention.
DAWN	What am I looking for?
GILES	See that knothole in the back wall?
DAWN	It's not a knothole.
GILES	Amanda, would you go down to the basement and get Spike?
DAWN	Maybe this will help. If this does get us closer to Caleb.
FAITH	Sounded like there was news.
SPIKE	What's up... Rupert?
GILES	I have a mission for you.
SPIKE	Really. Because, you know, sometimes our missions end up with you trying to kill me, I'm not fond of those.
GILES	This is... serious. With real... (looking around the room) ...ramifications. Have a look.
SPIKE	Ah. Looks like our boy was here. You want me to go check it out?
GILES	I need someone who can handle himself in case Caleb left any... souvenirs.
SPIKE	You want me to just go walking in there alone.
GILES	You'll be fine.
ANDREW	Are we gonna get to the food-stealing issue soon?
GILES	Take Andrew.
ANDREW	What??
DAWN	You're always saying you wanna get out of the house more.
ANDREW	Yeah, but --
GILES	There might be demons. Lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert, he can help.
SPIKE	Oh, please...
GILES	He can bring that pan-flute thing of his. Excellent. Off you go.
ANDREW	He's gonna need these...
DAWN	So, see? That's something, right? We'll have some news soon.
AMANDA	Sure. Maybe that'll get us somewhere.
FAITH	Maybe. Meantime, the "troops" here gotta sit and stew, feeling crappier by the minute.
DAWN	We should keep them occupied.
FAITH	Yeah. Yeah, I know how to keep 'em occupied.
KENNEDY	So what kind of band plays during an apocalypse?
DAWN	I think this band might actually be one of the signs.
BUFFY	Guys? How's it --
GILES	My god. What...
BUFFY	Caleb came looking for seconds.
GILES	Good lord. Is he...
BUFFY	Still able to make me see little cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. The short lack of consciousness was nice, though. I feel rested.
GILES	Oh, yes, very much so, I think. Evidence that Caleb may have made inroads up north.
BUFFY	Really? That's... that's great. That could help us a lot, good job --
GILES	I sent Spike to look into it.
BUFFY	Oh.
GILES	Yes. I sent Andrew with him.
BUFFY	And, again, I ask the question...
GILES	Buffy... you weren't here. Some decisions must be made in your absence.
BUFFY	Well, those are the ones that've been scaring me.
GILES	I did what I thought was right.
BUFFY	You sent away the guy who's been watching my back. Again. I think --
GILES	We are all watching your back.
BUFFY	Yeah. Funny how I don't really feel that lately.
GILES	Buffy --
BUFFY	Where's everyone else?
GILES	What?
BUFFY	Faith, the girls... where'd everyone go?
GILES	Faith thought the girls needed some time away from their studies, a chance to relax for an hour or two, I thought, given everything I learned from our time. (off Buffy's insistent stare) She took them to The Bronze.
CALEB	Know what I figured out tonight?
FIRST	And how was our best girl?
CALEB	They always think they should put up a fight.
FIRST	Did you lay the proper groundwork?
CALEB	That I did. Reckon she got the message, even if she doesn't know it yet. So now the big, strong slayer goes back to those girls. She's so ready to just walk them right into it, and all we're gonna hafta do... ... is give her that one... gentle... final... nudge.
FIRST	Excellent.
CALEB	Gotta say... I know she's supposed to be some great and powerful mystical force, but... I don't see it. I just don't. She was so... easy.
FIRST	Of course she was. And now it's just a question of knowing how to exploit it. And when.
FAITH	Was wonderin' what was takin' you boys so long. Where you been?
MUNROE	We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, Miss. Outstanding warrant.
FAITH	Yeah, or, let's try this one on instead, how 'bout you guys buy me a drink, and we see where the evenin' takes us.
DAWN	Hey!
MUNROE	'Fraid it's not that simple, Miss.
KENNEDY	What's that?
AMANDA	Something not good.
MUNROE	You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
FAITH	All right, wait a second --
MUNROE	You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you. Do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you?
KENNEDY	What's going on?
DAWN	They're trying to ...
MUNROE	You girls don't wanna get involved in this.
KENNEDY	Yeah, and maybe we do.
FAITH	I'm telling you now - I'm not going back to jail.
MUNROE	Who said anything about jail?
DUNCAN	Stay back. This doesn't concern you.
DAWN	You can't keep us in here.
DUNCAN	It'll be over before you know it...
DUNCAN	Trust me. Best thing you can do is wait here.
DAWN	Don't listen to him. He won't hurt us. I'll just go borrow their phone.
DUNCAN	Best thing you can do. Is wait. Here.
KENNEDY	You're gonna have to shoot us all to stop us.
DUNCAN	Doesn't really bother me. Back up .
AMANDA	No.
DUNCAN	What?
KENNEDY	You're not in charge here.
AMANDA	We are.
AMANDA	That was kinda cool.
FAITH	You know, when you've been locked up in prison for three years, you end up forgetting how good some things feel. Till you get out.
KENNEDY	Faith...
FAITH	Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt him.
BUFFY	What are you doing?
FAITH	Just blowing off steam. Well, it started out that way.
BUFFY	Girls. Go home. I wanna talk to Faith for a minute.
DAWN	Buffy, we were --
BUFFY	Dawn, you too. Go on.
FAITH	They needed a break, they were running themselves into the ground, things just got out of hand.
BUFFY	Taking a break is one thing, I get blowing off steam, but they were fighting. And those girls are drunk. What were you thinking?
FAITH	It seemed like a good idea at the time.
BUFFY	What if someone'd gotten hurt?
FAITH	They didn't.
BUFFY	Faith. I need to know those girls are gonna be safe when I'm not there.
FAITH	No one got hurt, B! Look, you don't even know these girls, maybe you need to have a little more confidence in 'em, let 'em get down and dirty, mess up sometimes. How the hell else are they gonna learn?
BUFFY	It's one thing to learn from your mistakes. But you don't throw children into --
FAITH	They're not children.
BUFFY	That's really not the point.
FAITH	What about the vineyard?
BUFFY	What?
FAITH	How safe were they when you dragged them off to meet Caleb? How safe was Rona? Or Amanda? Or Molly --
ANDREW	You sure you don't wanna just stop and pick up some burgers or something? You know, road trip food --
SPIKE	It's not a road trip. It's a covert operation.
ANDREW	Right, right, gotcha.
SPIKE	Not as good as those onion blossom things.
ANDREW	I love those!
SPIKE	Yeah, me too.
ANDREW	It's an onion, yet it's a flower. I don't understand how such a thing is possible.
SPIKE	See, the genius is, you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its shape, then you deep fry it root-side up for about five minutes.
ANDREW	Masterful.
SPIKE	Yeah. If you tell anyone we had this conversation, I'll bite you.
ANDREW	Okay.
WOOD	Big meeting started yet?
FAITH	God, I hope so.
WOOD	Faith.
FAITH	You must be Principal Wood. Heard a lot about you.
WOOD	It... hasn't really started, has it? I hate being late...
FAITH	Troops are still gathering. You're safe.
WOOD	Someone banged you up pretty good.
FAITH	Yeah. Cops. Mostly.
WOOD	Mostly?
FAITH	This one was from someone who just thinks she's a cop. It's my favorite of all my current bruises.
WOOD	I have no favorite bruise, I love them all the same.
FAITH	I'm not gonna kill her. Wanted to. But didn't. And, by the way, bully for me, since no one else said it.
WOOD	For not killing Buffy.
FAITH	It's this new thing I'm trying.
WOOD	She told me about you.
FAITH	Believe every word.
WOOD	So what changed? Why didn't you fight back?
FAITH	Other things matter more.
WOOD	And?
FAITH	And what, and whom?
WOOD	I think that's not all.
FAITH	You do.
WOOD	I do. You look like... I think you're worried about her.
FAITH	I think... I think you need to brush up on your Buffy-and-Faith history.
WOOD	Okay. You say so. It's just... I read people pretty well. It's a thing I do.
FAITH	You read people.
WOOD	I do.
FAITH	What kinda things?
WOOD	Just... things.
FAITH	You live around here, right?
WOOD	Uhhh, no, I, I mean, center of town, really, but...
FAITH	Where'd you park?
WOOD	I... walked.
FAITH	Yeah. I noticed. Interesting. Long way to walk. Especially place like Sunnydale.
WOOD	I, uh... huh?
FAITH	This town, walking anywhere after dark is like an extreme sport. Someone who didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or something.
WOOD	You've known me exactly fifty-three seconds.
FAITH	Just sayin', maybe you got bigger issues than what's wrong with B. I read people, too.
ANDREW	No one's here. These kinda places make me feel funny inside. SPIKE How 'bout that. You and me got something else in common after all.
ANDREW	This one time, when I was in Sunday School, I woke up late, so my mom made me skip breakfast, and I was really hungry, so I told the teacher I had to go to the bathroom, but I really broke into the supply cabinet and ate a whole package of communion wafers.
SPIKE	Yeah? Good on you, boy.
ANDREW	But then I got sick for two days --
XANDER	Oh god.
KENNEDY	We didn't have time to do more. You have to pretend there's a big party here.
XANDER	That's fine, actually. Parties in this house... I usually end up having to re-build something.
AMANDA	I was thinking of smashing a window just to make you feel at home, but then I thought, you know. No. Also, Dawn wouldn't let me.
BUFFY	I wanted you to be here for this, I think you're gonna be interested in what I found out.
WILLOW	What's... what did you find out?
BUFFY	It's about the wine cellar.
PRIEST	Please. Do it quickly.
SPIKE	Not without us two having a good death-bed chat.
PRIEST	No! No!
SPIKE	Then tell me what happened.
PRIEST	I, I can't -
ANDREW	"Can't" is a four letter word.
SPIKE	We're trying to fight him. Caleb. We need your help.
PRIEST	You can't fight him. You can't stop him. You can only... run.
ANDREW	"Run" is a three-letter word.
SPIKE	Talk.
PRIEST	I'll do better. I'll show you.
SPIKE	And you said "c'mon in, do some damage."
PRIEST	We are... were a benevolent order and, yes, we welcomed him. We offered to feed him.
PRIEST	He made his way here, to the inner sanctum. He was excited, talking the whole time... destiny, that sort of thing. We followed him here.
SPIKE	Yeah, we hear he's a smooth talker.
PRIEST	Behind this, he revealed something we didn't even know was here. Before our time.
ANDREW	Neat.
PRIEST	He read it. And he didn't like what it said. His temper... he, he was like... He was not a friendly man. He was the purest evil I have ever seen. He heated his ring with a lighter, pressed it against me. And then I... ran. And hid. And listened to the others die.
ANDREW	Running away. It saved your life.
SPIKE	"It is not for thee. It is for her alone to wield."
BUFFY	Listen, I know what you're thinking, scary place where good guys go boom, I get it. I do. But I had a little visit today at the school from Caleb.
DAWN	Buffy, god, are you --
BUFFY	I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. I figured it out. He kept making all this noise about the school.
WOOD	Is it the Seal again?
WILLOW	Do we need to try shutting it again?
ANYA	Andrew's got plenty of tears left in him, just tell him they canceled Stargate.
BUFFY	No, that's just it. We've spent so much time being worried about the Hellmouth and the Seal... why isn't Caleb guarding them?
FAITH	Or, in the alternative, how about we... don't.
BUFFY	I'm not saying it'll be easy --
WOOD	Buffy. Listen to what she's saying.
FAITH	Maybe it'll end okay, the way you wanna play it. But maybe it won't. And right now... right now I don't think I want you playing the odds. Not with my coin.
BUFFY	I'm not just guessing about this.
FAITH	Listen. We're fighters. All of us. But you gotta give me something to fight. Something real. Not...
GILES	Windmills.
BUFFY	There is something there.
GILES	Maybe. But we don't know that for sure.
BUFFY	You're waiting for some kind of mystical sign to show up and tell us it's the right time, that sort of thing almost never happens, least, not for us. We need to strike now.
GILES	And I think whatever is there, if anything is there, will still be there in a few days.
BUFFY	I don't know that. We don't know that. What if we let it go and we lose our chance? I'm not prepared to live with that.
WOOD	And if we rush in now, before we're ready, and more people get hurt, are you prepared to live with that?
BUFFY	I don't understand. Seven years I've kept us safe by doing this, exactly this, making the hard decisions. Suddenly you're all acting like you don't trust me.
GILES	But didn't you just tell me today that you don't feel like you can trust us? Maybe there's something going on that we need to address.
BUFFY	Is this why you sent Spike away? To ambush me?
RONA	Look around you, this isn't about Spike. This is about you. You're being reckless.
BUFFY	What?
RONA	You are. I don't even know you, and I can tell. You're so obsessed with beating this guy that you're willing to jump into any plan without thinking.
BUFFY	That's not what I'm doing.
KENNEDY	Well, that's how it feels to us! People are dying! We. Are dying.
WILLOW	Back off, stop it.
BUFFY	I'm a who? I'm not --
WILLOW	Once you've had some rest, I think you'll be able to --
BUFFY	I don't need rest! Willow, I'm fine. I'm... I'm fine.
GILES	Buffy, the rules have changed. And I'm not sure doing things the old way will help you here.
BUFFY	The old way. You mean by leading.
WILLOW	No, that's not it at all, it's just --
BUFFY	Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. It would be more fair, I agree. But democracies don't win battles. It's a hard truth, but there has to be a single voice. You need me to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and not take your feelings into account.
ANYA	And it's automatically you. You really do think you're better than we are.
BUFFY	No, I --
ANYA	You do. Of course you do. That's why it's your voice leading us.
BUFFY	Look --
ANYA	But we don't know, do we? We'll never know. That you're actually better. You came into the world with certain advantages, sure, that's the legacy.
BUFFY	I --
ANYA	But you didn't earn them. You didn't work for them. You never had someone come to you and say, Here, you deserve these more than anyone else. They were just... handed to you. And that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.
BUFFY	I've gotten you this far.
XANDER	Not without a price.
BUFFY	Xander...
XANDER	We follow you without question. Even when you have no idea what you're doing. Even when you get mad at us for not working hard enough at a plan which doesn't exist, because you don't know what you're doing. We keep following you, even then. And we keep paying the price.
BUFFY	Xander. I've paid the price, too, sometimes.
GILES	So how high does the price have to go before you start saying your way isn't right?
BUFFY	I still think attacking Caleb's power base could end this --
GILES	Yes. You. Think. But when you act alone --
BUFFY	Is that really something you want to get into? 'Cause we can talk about Spike. Or Ben.
GILES	If I acted rashly, it was to protect you. Were you trying to protect Annabelle? Or Chloe?
BUFFY	Stop it.
GILES	Or Molly? Or Xander? And it goes even further back than that, doesn't it?
BUFFY	Giles.
GILES	You act alone, and people get hurt, right? People like Jenny
BUFFY	Goddamn you, stop!!
GILES	Do you see? You are not in the best place you have ever been. You're too raw. You need to take a break.
BUFFY	I am still responsible for this group. I am still in charge here.
RONA	And why is that, exactly?
BUFFY	Because I'm the Slayer.
RONA	And isn't Faith a Slayer, too?
FAITH	Ka-wha? Whoa, whoa, whoa, so not what I meant, I'm not the in-charge chick, I just think B here needs to chill out for a bit, take a siesta maybe, but I'm not the one you want.
KENNEDY	Maybe we need a vote. To see who wants Faith to have a turn in charge.
BUFFY	Listen. You don't wanna do this. (to Willow and Xander) Guys, tell them. This is a mistake.
WILLOW	You need to rest.
XANDER	Maybe it's not such a terrible idea. Letting Faith handle things. Letting her be the Slayer.
BUFFY	Guys. We have a chance to end this. All of us. I can't just stay here and watch Faith lead you off into some disaster.
DAWN	Then you can't stay here.
I	don't think... I don't think you can face this at all. This one you have to sit out.
BUFFY	It's like these people have never seen an apocalypse before. And you're just out for a quick spin, right? Maybe out to the 7-11... in Nebraska...
CLEM	It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling it, getting crazier. And you can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic activity. Not that I... swing cats. Or eat... Nope. Cutting way back. Cholesterol. Morals. I mean morals.
BUFFY	Right.
CLEM	We've seen bad stuff in this town before, but, you know... this time, it's like, it just seems... different. More powerful. I don't think anyone's gonna be able to stop it -- I mean... I'm sure you're gonna do fine. Complete faith in you. If anyone can do it, you can, 'cause... you rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have a drink -- When! When, I mean! When you save the world. It's gonna be great! With the, you know... rocking...
BUFFY	Yeah. I probably should.
GILES	Thank you, officer. I appreciate your help.
OFFICER	Thank you , Inspector. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so we're happy to help with anything you need. Is there anything else...?
WILLOW	No. Thank you. We're fine.
OFFICER	Right... because you're... wait... (creeping confusion) Who are...
WILLOW	I'm with the Inspector.
OFFICER	You're with the Inspector. Right. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol --
WILLOW	Ow.
OFFICER	People're acting up. Getting nuts. We do what we can, but our hands are kinda tied. I mean, man, let us know if you need help with your guy, cuz we're itchin' to hand out some justice .
WILLOW	He wasn't much of a threat...
WILLOW	Good idea. My control was fading. What's up with them?
GILES	Same thing as everyone else. Hellmouth is active again.
WILLOW	C'mon. I wanna get back to Xander.
MUNROE	Who was that?
OFFICER	I... I'm not sure.
DUNCAN	You get one 'a these yet?
OFFICER	What is it?
MUNROE	Fugitive. Ran to ground right here in our own back yard.
OFFICER	Yeah? Sounds like a situation needs some justice.
BUFFY	...and that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandage. Bruising around the... area. The, uh, musculature and bone structure took a heavy hit.
XANDER	Okay.
BUFFY	Also, the meds may cause some stomach discomfort, so we're gonna have to be, you know, careful. About your diet.
XANDER	Can't really taste anything, anyway. I keep waiting for all my other senses to improve by fifty percent, should kick in any day now.
BUFFY	And we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Once your labs are back. Doctor Kallet says they should be a couple hours.
WILLOW	Oh, but I thought we were gonna -- there were gonna be card games...
BUFFY	Yeah, you know, I should really get back. (re: folder again) I wanna get 'em working on this stuff. I think we're getting really close to something.
WILLOW	But --
XANDER	It's okay. Gotta be done. And maybe I'll see you tonight. Without any depth of field of course, but still...
WILLOW	So, you're stuck with me then, huh, let's get us some cherry-flavored off- brand gelatin, and then I think we're gonna be ready for a rousing game of --
XANDER	I'm gonna need a parrot.
WILLOW	Huh?
XANDER	To go with the eyepatch. You know. Complete the look. I think I still have that costume from Halloween...
WILLOW	Ahhh. Yes, well, don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. You know, the hospital can probably hook you up with a nice one, maybe they have a two-body-parts-for-one kinda deal.
XANDER	Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch Jaws 3-D again!
WILLOW	Right! Plus, you never have to...
KENNEDY	Um... no.
ANYA	Oh. Right. But the heart thing is still good to know since holy water runs off these guys like they're scotch-guarded, and sunlight would work, but, guess what, they're not coming out during the day.
RONA	Okay, you know what? I used to be afraid of the ubervamp guys. Then the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm just mostly terrified of him.
KENNEDY	We saw him do stuff...
ANYA	Right, well, we're working on getting info on him, but in the meantime --
AMANDA	Why bother?
KENNEDY	Got enough to share?
FAITH	I'll trade ya for a carton of cigarettes and some soap. Sorry. Habit.
FAITH	All right, playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique is probably a little different than what you're used to.
AMANDA	'Cause I really hope I don't have to study all that.
FAITH	Yeah, whenever she starts talkin' 'bout gettin' all sweaty with Xander like that, I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up. Might work less well for you guys.
KENNEDY	Thing is, what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't do a helluva lotta good when Preacher Man is out there ready to finish the job he started.
FAITH	No one's come up with any info yet about Caleb...?
AMANDA	No. Nothing is working, not research, not Anya's contacts...
KENNEDY	We're lousy with dead ends around here. Everyone's feeling pretty... pointless. We don't even have a place to start.
DAWN	Buffy! How's Xander?
BUFFY	He's doing really well, he's ready to come home, I think.
FAITH	Whatcha got?
BUFFY	Info Willow and Giles were able to get from the police database.
FAITH	Incidents of violence and vandalism connected to California religious institutions in the last ten years. Looks like this gives us a place to start.
BUFFY	Exactly. We start with California, if nothing turns up, we expand the search to other areas, but a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game, he's been playing for a while. We thought we'd try to find out where.
DAWN	So we look at recent events, see if anything smacks of Caleb's M.O.
BUFFY	Right. And if that doesn't work, we'll try something else. Whatever it takes. You okay to help?
DAWN	Well, I was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but, darn all the luck, that's when they cancelled school. So it turns out I got the time.
BUFFY	Good.
BUFFY	Okay.
FAITH	Hey, pipsqueak. Why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten from Giles?
DAWN	Fine. We can cross-reference all of this to Giles' files, see what we get. Plus, I could say "Giles' files" some more. I'll be right back.
BUFFY	Okay. So we're looking for anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring...
KENNEDY	His ability to render a Slayer useless in just one punch...
BUFFY	It's okay. You know, I gotta get to the school anyway, pick up the rest of my stuff.
KENNEDY	I really didn't mean to --
BUFFY	It's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, doesn't... isn't Anya doing a thing for you guys today?
KENNEDY	Yeah, we were... we should probably head down there now.
BUFFY	Okay, I'll be back soon. See if you can get everyone started on this stuff in the meantime.
BUFFY	Get out of here.
CALEB	Now, now, little girl. Manners. Though I do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours has inflamed many a man. Weak as they are.
BUFFY	You get near Xander again, I will end you.
DAWN	Not much. Most of these places were hit by run-of-the-mill vandalism. Basic B-and-E, money stolen, sometimes colorful language painted on the doors. Did you notice how I just kinda threw B-and-E in there? It's a law enforcement term.
GILES	Yes. Yes, excellent work. Very proud.
DAWN	Here's the one that stood out. It's a mission up north in Gilroy.
ANDREW	Um, Mr. Giles? Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella flavored Hot Pocket out of the freezer even though I had called dibs on it.
GILES	I don't see anything.
DAWN	Exactly. No vandalism at all.
GILES	Then why is it in the file?
DAWN	Place was abandoned. Locals started realizing after a few days no one was going in or out. Six members of the order lived there, when the cops showed up... all gone. Unsolved.
ANDREW	Yup. See, the post-it's still there, "Andrew's, please do not eat," but the box is empty now.
GILES	Oh.
DAWN	Oh? Oh, good?
GILES	Not sure. Here...
DAWN	What am I looking for?
GILES	See that knothole in the back wall?
SPIKE	What's up... Rupert?
GILES	I have a mission for you.
SPIKE	Really. Because, you know, sometimes our missions end up with you trying to kill me, I'm not fond of those.
GILES	This is... serious. With real... (looking around the room) ...ramifications. Have a look.
SPIKE	Ah. Looks like our boy was here. You want me to go check it out?
GILES	I need someone who can handle himself in case Caleb left any... souvenirs.
SPIKE	You want me to just go walking in there alone.
GILES	You'll be fine.
ANDREW	Are we gonna get to the food-stealing issue soon?
GILES	Take Andrew.
ANDREW	What??
DAWN	You're always saying you wanna get out of the house more.
ANDREW	Yeah, but --
GILES	There might be demons. Lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert, he can help.
SPIKE	Oh, please...
GILES	He can bring that pan-flute thing of his. Excellent. Off you go.
DAWN	So, see? That's something, right? We'll have some news soon.
AMANDA	Sure. Maybe that'll get us somewhere.
FAITH	Maybe. Meantime, the "troops" here gotta sit and stew, feeling crappier by the minute.
DAWN	We should keep them occupied.
FAITH	Yeah. Yeah, I know how to keep 'em occupied.
KENNEDY	So what kind of band plays during an apocalypse?
DAWN	I think this band might actually be one of the signs.
GILES	My god. What...
BUFFY	Caleb came looking for seconds.
GILES	Good lord. Is he...
BUFFY	Still able to make me see little cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. The short lack of consciousness was nice, though. I feel rested.
GILES	Oh, yes, very much so, I think. Evidence that Caleb may have made inroads up north.
BUFFY	Really? That's... that's great. That could help us a lot, good job --
GILES	I sent Spike to look into it.
GILES	Yes. I sent Andrew with him.
BUFFY	And, again, I ask the question...
GILES	Buffy... you weren't here. Some decisions must be made in your absence.
BUFFY	Well, those are the ones that've been scaring me.
GILES	I did what I thought was right.
BUFFY	You sent away the guy who's been watching my back. Again. I think --
GILES	We are all watching your back.
BUFFY	Yeah. Funny how I don't really feel that lately.
GILES	Buffy --
BUFFY	Where's everyone else?
GILES	What?
BUFFY	Faith, the girls... where'd everyone go?
GILES	Faith thought the girls needed some time away from their studies, a chance to relax for an hour or two, I thought, given everything I learned from our time. (off Buffy's insistent stare) She took them to The Bronze.
FIRST	And how was our best girl?
CALEB	They always think they should put up a fight.
FIRST	Did you lay the proper groundwork?
CALEB	That I did. Reckon she got the message, even if she doesn't know it yet. So now the big, strong slayer goes back to those girls. She's so ready to just walk them right into it, and all we're gonna hafta do... ... is give her that one... gentle... final... nudge.
FIRST	Excellent.
CALEB	Gotta say... I know she's supposed to be some great and powerful mystical force, but... I don't see it. I just don't. She was so... easy.
FIRST	Of course she was. And now it's just a question of knowing how to exploit it. And when.
FAITH	Was wonderin' what was takin' you boys so long. Where you been?
MUNROE	We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, Miss. Outstanding warrant.
FAITH	Yeah, or, let's try this one on instead, how 'bout you guys buy me a drink, and we see where the evenin' takes us.
DAWN	Hey!
MUNROE	'Fraid it's not that simple, Miss.
KENNEDY	What's that?
AMANDA	Something not good.
MUNROE	You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
FAITH	All right, wait a second --
MUNROE	You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you. Do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you?
KENNEDY	What's going on?
DAWN	They're trying to ...
MUNROE	You girls don't wanna get involved in this.
KENNEDY	Yeah, and maybe we do.
DUNCAN	Stay back. This doesn't concern you.
DAWN	You can't keep us in here.
DUNCAN	It'll be over before you know it...
DUNCAN	Trust me. Best thing you can do is wait here.
DAWN	Don't listen to him. He won't hurt us. I'll just go borrow their phone.
KENNEDY	You're gonna have to shoot us all to stop us.
DUNCAN	Doesn't really bother me. Back up .
AMANDA	No.
DUNCAN	What?
KENNEDY	You're not in charge here.
KENNEDY	Faith...
FAITH	Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt him.
FAITH	Just blowing off steam. Well, it started out that way.
BUFFY	Girls. Go home. I wanna talk to Faith for a minute.
DAWN	Buffy, we were --
BUFFY	Dawn, you too. Go on.
FAITH	They needed a break, they were running themselves into the ground, things just got out of hand.
BUFFY	Taking a break is one thing, I get blowing off steam, but they were fighting. And those girls are drunk. What were you thinking?
FAITH	It seemed like a good idea at the time.
BUFFY	What if someone'd gotten hurt?
FAITH	They didn't.
BUFFY	Faith. I need to know those girls are gonna be safe when I'm not there.
FAITH	No one got hurt, B! Look, you don't even know these girls, maybe you need to have a little more confidence in 'em, let 'em get down and dirty, mess up sometimes. How the hell else are they gonna learn?
BUFFY	It's one thing to learn from your mistakes. But you don't throw children into --
FAITH	They're not children.
BUFFY	That's really not the point.
BUFFY	What?
FAITH	How safe were they when you dragged them off to meet Caleb? How safe was Rona? Or Amanda? Or Molly --
ANDREW	You sure you don't wanna just stop and pick up some burgers or something? You know, road trip food --
SPIKE	It's not a road trip. It's a covert operation.
ANDREW	Right, right, gotcha.
SPIKE	Not as good as those onion blossom things.
ANDREW	I love those!
SPIKE	Yeah, me too.
ANDREW	It's an onion, yet it's a flower. I don't understand how such a thing is possible.
SPIKE	See, the genius is, you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its shape, then you deep fry it root-side up for about five minutes.
ANDREW	Masterful.
SPIKE	Yeah. If you tell anyone we had this conversation, I'll bite you.
ANDREW	Okay.
WOOD	Big meeting started yet?
FAITH	God, I hope so.
WOOD	Faith.
FAITH	You must be Principal Wood. Heard a lot about you.
WOOD	It... hasn't really started, has it? I hate being late...
FAITH	Troops are still gathering. You're safe.
WOOD	Someone banged you up pretty good.
FAITH	Yeah. Cops. Mostly.
WOOD	Mostly?
FAITH	This one was from someone who just thinks she's a cop. It's my favorite of all my current bruises.
WOOD	I have no favorite bruise, I love them all the same.
FAITH	I'm not gonna kill her. Wanted to. But didn't. And, by the way, bully for me, since no one else said it.
WOOD	For not killing Buffy.
FAITH	It's this new thing I'm trying.
WOOD	She told me about you.
FAITH	Believe every word.
WOOD	So what changed? Why didn't you fight back?
FAITH	Other things matter more.
WOOD	And?
FAITH	And what, and whom?
WOOD	I think that's not all.
FAITH	You do.
WOOD	I do. You look like... I think you're worried about her.
FAITH	I think... I think you need to brush up on your Buffy-and-Faith history.
WOOD	Okay. You say so. It's just... I read people pretty well. It's a thing I do.
FAITH	You read people.
WOOD	I do.
WOOD	Uhhh, no, I, I mean, center of town, really, but...
FAITH	Where'd you park?
WOOD	I... walked.
FAITH	Yeah. I noticed. Interesting. Long way to walk. Especially place like Sunnydale.
WOOD	I, uh... huh?
FAITH	This town, walking anywhere after dark is like an extreme sport. Someone who didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or something.
WOOD	You've known me exactly fifty-three seconds.
SPIKE	Yeah? Good on you, boy.
ANDREW	But then I got sick for two days --
XANDER	Oh god.
KENNEDY	We didn't have time to do more. You have to pretend there's a big party here.
XANDER	That's fine, actually. Parties in this house... I usually end up having to re-build something.
AMANDA	I was thinking of smashing a window just to make you feel at home, but then I thought, you know. No. Also, Dawn wouldn't let me.
WILLOW	What's... what did you find out?
BUFFY	It's about the wine cellar.
SPIKE	Not without us two having a good death-bed chat.
PRIEST	No! No!
SPIKE	Then tell me what happened.
PRIEST	I, I can't -
ANDREW	"Can't" is a four letter word.
SPIKE	We're trying to fight him. Caleb. We need your help.
PRIEST	You can't fight him. You can't stop him. You can only... run.
ANDREW	"Run" is a three-letter word.
SPIKE	And you said "c'mon in, do some damage."
PRIEST	We are... were a benevolent order and, yes, we welcomed him. We offered to feed him.
PRIEST	He made his way here, to the inner sanctum. He was excited, talking the whole time... destiny, that sort of thing. We followed him here.
SPIKE	Yeah, we hear he's a smooth talker.
PRIEST	He read it. And he didn't like what it said. His temper... he, he was like... He was not a friendly man. He was the purest evil I have ever seen. He heated his ring with a lighter, pressed it against me. And then I... ran. And hid. And listened to the others die.
ANDREW	Running away. It saved your life.
SPIKE	"It is not for thee. It is for her alone to wield."
BUFFY	Listen, I know what you're thinking, scary place where good guys go boom, I get it. I do. But I had a little visit today at the school from Caleb.
DAWN	Buffy, god, are you --
BUFFY	I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. I figured it out. He kept making all this noise about the school.
WOOD	Is it the Seal again?
WILLOW	Do we need to try shutting it again?
ANYA	Andrew's got plenty of tears left in him, just tell him they canceled Stargate.
BUFFY	No, that's just it. We've spent so much time being worried about the Hellmouth and the Seal... why isn't Caleb guarding them?
BUFFY	I'm not saying it'll be easy --
WOOD	Buffy. Listen to what she's saying.
FAITH	Maybe it'll end okay, the way you wanna play it. But maybe it won't. And right now... right now I don't think I want you playing the odds. Not with my coin.
BUFFY	I'm not just guessing about this.
FAITH	Listen. We're fighters. All of us. But you gotta give me something to fight. Something real. Not...
GILES	Windmills.
BUFFY	There is something there.
GILES	Maybe. But we don't know that for sure.
BUFFY	You're waiting for some kind of mystical sign to show up and tell us it's the right time, that sort of thing almost never happens, least, not for us. We need to strike now.
GILES	And I think whatever is there, if anything is there, will still be there in a few days.
BUFFY	I don't know that. We don't know that. What if we let it go and we lose our chance? I'm not prepared to live with that.
WOOD	And if we rush in now, before we're ready, and more people get hurt, are you prepared to live with that?
BUFFY	I don't understand. Seven years I've kept us safe by doing this, exactly this, making the hard decisions. Suddenly you're all acting like you don't trust me.
GILES	But didn't you just tell me today that you don't feel like you can trust us? Maybe there's something going on that we need to address.
BUFFY	Is this why you sent Spike away? To ambush me?
RONA	Look around you, this isn't about Spike. This is about you. You're being reckless.
BUFFY	What?
RONA	You are. I don't even know you, and I can tell. You're so obsessed with beating this guy that you're willing to jump into any plan without thinking.
BUFFY	That's not what I'm doing.
BUFFY	I'm a who? I'm not --
WILLOW	Once you've had some rest, I think you'll be able to --
BUFFY	I don't need rest! Willow, I'm fine. I'm... I'm fine.
GILES	Buffy, the rules have changed. And I'm not sure doing things the old way will help you here.
BUFFY	The old way. You mean by leading.
WILLOW	No, that's not it at all, it's just --
BUFFY	Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. It would be more fair, I agree. But democracies don't win battles. It's a hard truth, but there has to be a single voice. You need me to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and not take your feelings into account.
ANYA	And it's automatically you. You really do think you're better than we are.
BUFFY	No, I --
ANYA	You do. Of course you do. That's why it's your voice leading us.
BUFFY	Look --
ANYA	But we don't know, do we? We'll never know. That you're actually better. You came into the world with certain advantages, sure, that's the legacy.
BUFFY	I --
ANYA	But you didn't earn them. You didn't work for them. You never had someone come to you and say, Here, you deserve these more than anyone else. They were just... handed to you. And that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.
BUFFY	I've gotten you this far.
XANDER	Not without a price.
BUFFY	Xander...
XANDER	We follow you without question. Even when you have no idea what you're doing. Even when you get mad at us for not working hard enough at a plan which doesn't exist, because you don't know what you're doing. We keep following you, even then. And we keep paying the price.
BUFFY	Xander. I've paid the price, too, sometimes.
GILES	So how high does the price have to go before you start saying your way isn't right?
BUFFY	I still think attacking Caleb's power base could end this --
GILES	Yes. You. Think. But when you act alone --
BUFFY	Is that really something you want to get into? 'Cause we can talk about Spike. Or Ben.
GILES	If I acted rashly, it was to protect you. Were you trying to protect Annabelle? Or Chloe?
BUFFY	Stop it.
GILES	Or Molly? Or Xander? And it goes even further back than that, doesn't it?
BUFFY	Giles.
GILES	You act alone, and people get hurt, right? People like Jenny
BUFFY	Goddamn you, stop!!
GILES	Do you see? You are not in the best place you have ever been. You're too raw. You need to take a break.
BUFFY	I am still responsible for this group. I am still in charge here.
RONA	And why is that, exactly?
BUFFY	Because I'm the Slayer.
RONA	And isn't Faith a Slayer, too?
KENNEDY	Maybe we need a vote. To see who wants Faith to have a turn in charge.
BUFFY	Listen. You don't wanna do this. (to Willow and Xander) Guys, tell them. This is a mistake.
WILLOW	You need to rest.
XANDER	Maybe it's not such a terrible idea. Letting Faith handle things. Letting her be the Slayer.

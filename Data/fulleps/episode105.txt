BUFFY	Hello!
BUFFY	Yep. Me. And I picked up dinner. Deep fried chicken parts.
BUFFY	Hope everyone's hungr--
GILES	No! Um, well... Yes, obviously.
DAWN	We didn't know when you'd be coming back.
BUFFY	S'okay. More for me.
TARA	Well, I don't know about everybody else, but I'd love some chicken.
GILES	Yes. As would I.
DAWN	I'll take a drumstick.
WILLOW	I'm a breast girl myself. But then you all know that.
DAWN	So...?
BUFFY	What, so?
DAWN	So, how was it? Seeing Angel? Him seeing you. Was it weird?
BUFFY	Intense.
WILLOW	Well, if you want to talk about it...
BUFFY	I don't. It's...not important. It's past. So I'll just keep this one to myself, if that's okay.
DAWN	Sure, whatever.
GILES	Buffy, there was some discussion during your absence about... Well, about what you're going to do now. Your plans.
BUFFY	Oh, yeah. Thought a lot about that. And I'm pretty sure I figured out what it is I should be doing.
WILLOW	Good. That's good.
BUFFY	Yeah. Got it all wired. I'll hold off paying the plumber right away, use the money to pay the utility bills, that way I can wait to re- shingle the roof until--
GILES	I mean... With your life.
BUFFY	Oh. Life plans. I, uh... have no idea. I mean, I guess... Well, I left school when Mom got sick. Always figured I'd go back later. But then she... So I was thinking of reenrolling for the Fall. But I missed the registration cut- off, busy being dead and all...
WILLOW	Well, even if it's too late for late enrollment, and too early for early, you could still come to classes with Tara and me.
TARA	Right. You can audit for the rest of the semester, until registration.
BUFFY	Audit. Okay. That seems like a... pretty good plan. I guess. I mean, sure. I could do that. Right? What--what do you think, Giles?
JONATHON	Sharp, decisive. Always with a plan. We are never gonna become the Crime Lords of Sunnydale with her always one step ahead of us.
WARREN	She's ready.
JONATHON	Sweet. Run me through it.
WARREN	Got nine high-resolution surveillance cameras hooked in: Super wide angle, infrared, autoiris... Plus six kinds of audio matrix monitoring, filtered through a dual quad DVR system and --
JONATHON	Yeah, fine, just tell me... You sure, with all this stuff, we'll be able to watch Buffy without her noticing us?
WARREN	Absolutely. She'll never know we're-- (sees something) What the hell is that?!
ANDREW	Death Star, dude. Wicked, huh.
JONATHON	Uh, Thermal Exhaust Port's above the Main Port, numbnuts.
ANDREW	For your information, I was using the Empire;s revised design from Return of the Jedi .
JONATHON	That's a flawed--
WARREN	Hey!! The thing is... Since we're messing with the Slayer, who could pummel the three of us into a sludgy substance, it might be a good idea NOT to draw ATTENTION TO OURSELVES !
ANDREW	I could paint over it, if you--
WARREN	Do that! 'Cause this time tomorrow, the games begin...
BUFFY	I mean, I thought it might be weird being back. And, it is, a little but it's a good kind of weird.
WILLOW	Oh, there's the teacher. Mike.
BUFFY	You call your teacher "Mike?" Wow. School sure has changed since my day.
MIKE	"Social Construction of Reality" (turning to the class) Who can tell me what that is?
RACHEL	A concept involving a couple of opposing theories. One stressing the externality and independence of social reality from individuals...
MIKE	And the flip side?
MIKE	Good. Who can expand on that?
BUFFY	Will, I'm not following this too well.
WILLOW	The trick is to just get into the rhythm, go with the flow.
BUFFY	Flow-going might be easier if your classmates weren't all big brains.
WILLOW	Buffy, that’s ridiculous. They’re no smarter than you or me.
WILLOW	Because social phenomena don’t have unproblematic objective existences, they have to be interpreted and given meanings by those who encounter them.
MIKE	Nicely put. So, Ruby, does that mean there are countless realities?
WILLOW	What?
WILLOW	You’re not dumb. Just... rusty.
BUFFY	Maybe I should ease back in with some nice, breezy, non-taxing classes. Like “Introduction to Pies.” Or “Advanced Walking.”
TARA	Hey, how’d it go?
WILLOW	She did fine. Sociology not a big fave.
TARA	She didn’t like Mike?
BUFFY	Look, it’s okay. Just have to do a little more reacclimating than I thought. You know, get back up to speed so I can catch up to-- Oof!
WILLOW	Could at least say sorry, rude-o.
TARA	Everybody’s in a hurry.
WARREN	Francis Seven, this is Logan Five. I’m in position. Do you copy?
JONATHAN	And you’re up on the monitor.
ANDREW	Hey, Warren. This is working great.
WARREN	Repeat, inhibitor is on. Initiate Omega Pulse Sequence.
JONATHAN	Ohhhh./I was gonna guess that.
TARA	My art appreciation class doesn’t start for another twenty minutes, so we’ve got some time to kill. Here.
BUFFY	What the f --
WARREN	Is it working? Is it doing it?
JONATHAN	Dude. It’s doing it.
ANDREW	And it’s wicked cool.
BUFFY	Tara!
TARA	Buffy. Where’ve you been? You missed art class - -
BUFFY	Missed--? Tara, something freaky’s going on. It’s like I’m losing --
BUFFY	Tara! Wait! Come...
ANDREW	Uh oh.
JONATHAN	She found it. Self destruct! Self destruct!
WARREN	Okay. Score me.
JONATHAN	Right. Fifty points for ingenuity. Another thirty since it involved actual contact.
ANDREW	Very smooth, by the way.
JONATHAN	On the freakometer, I’d say she was at a six.
WARREN	C’mon, eight! Easy!
JONATHAN	Eh. We’ll split the dif. Call it a seven. Which is good for 140. Giving you a grand total of...
ANDREW	Two Hundred and Twenty.
WARREN	Beat that.
ANDREW	Oh. I will.
BUFFY	Diving right into the work force. Being the breadwinner. Building things with my hands.
XANDER	Uh, actually, your hands won’t be building so much as they’ll be lifting and toting.
BUFFY	Toting?
XANDER	It’s just a temp gig, Buf. You know, unless it takes. Since you're not union, I had to call in a few favors to get you on a crew.
BUFFY	Well, I appreciate it. Muchly. You saved me from having to accept Giles’ offer to work at the magic shop. I mean, retail...? Gaaah. I’d rather be dead. Again.
XANDER	Uh-huh. So, Giles have any thoughts about that little fast-forward freak-out you had at school?
BUFFY	No. Well, he implied it might have been stress related. Like I imagined it or something. I don’t know. Maybe... I guess I could’ve been blacking out. Although I did find this thing stuck to my sweater that went poof. Or blew away. Could’ve been lint. Or maybe evil lint...
XANDER	Okay, first tip of the day: when I introduce you to Tony, the foreman... You may wanna leave out stuff about blacking out and evil lint.
XANDER	Tony... This is Buffy. You know, the friend I told you about.
BUFFY	Nice to meet you, Tony.
TONY	You gotta be kidding me. We’re a week behind, I got two men out on the DL and now you want us to baby-sit some little girl.
BUFFY	Uh, excuse me, but--
TONY	Hang on, Gidget. This stinks Harris. What am I supposed to --
XANDER	Give her a chance. She's stronger than she looks.
BUFFY	What? Wait! Where are you going?
XANDER	Upstairs. Gotta supervise the sheet rock hangers. Don't sweat it. I'll check in later.
TONY	Okay , Danny finish up putting in those J-boxes. Vince and Marco, need you to haul steel inside.
VINCE	Gee, I dunno, Tone. I mean, I don't wanna get in trouble with any of those Affirmative Action lawyers. I say you put Britney here on hauling duty.
BUFFY	It’s “Buffy.”
TONY	Okay. You’re on it, princess. Try not to break a nail.
BUFFY	“Break a nail?”
MARCO	And don’t let ‘em goad you into doing something stupid and hurting yourself. These beams weigh a few hundred pounds.
BUFFY	I got it. Which way’s the stairwell?
BUFFY	...So, basically, I’m just trying to learn everything I can. ‘Cause I don’t want to just have a job, you know, I want a career. Something I can grow into...
RON	Hey! We get paid by the hour. Wanna ruin it for the rest of us? Slow down.
VINCE	Wanna take a look at these blueprints? You know, since you’re into learning.
BUFFY	Um, okay. Sure.
VINCE	Tell us what you think.
BUFFY	Well, I’m no structural engineer, but looks a little top heavy.
VINCE	C’mon, girls. Lunch break.
JONATHAN	That’s not 8 o’clock.
WARREN	It is if you’re facing the front of the van.
JONATHAN	But we’re not facing the front of the van. We’re facing out that way. That’s 12. So she’s at 11.
WARREN	She’s over there, okay?!
JONATHAN	Okay!
TONY	Jumpy. Whatsa matter? I scare you?
MARCO	Look out!
VINCE	Oh, God. Help me! Help me, please.
ANDREW	Aw, man. She took ‘em out.
WARREN	Lemme see.
ANDREW	Okay, give ‘em back now.
WARREN	I’m still looking.
ANDREW	You had your turn, give me the --
JONATHAN	Duck!
ANDREW	Hey, all you said was lose the mural.
XANDER	Buffy? What-- What happened? How--?
BUFFY	I didn’t do that!
TONY	Came over to tell your friend I was impressed with the job she was doing, liking the way she handles herself... Then, all of a sudden, she goes berserk and attacks me.
BUFFY	What? No! I was saving you... There-- There were...
XANDER	Here? No. Not here. Not at my job. That’s your job.
BUFFY	I can’t help where the forces of darkness attack me, Xander.
XANDER	Buffy, look at this mess! You have any idea how much it’s gonna cost to repair this? What am I supposed to say to the clients? Should I just show them the demon bodies and say it’s all their fault?
BUFFY	Can’t. They melted.
VINCE	I dunno what you’re talking about. All I saw was you losing it or something. Time of the month.
BUFFY	What?! You-- You were huddled in the corner. Crying. Like a baby.
VINCE	Hey!
BUFFY	Xander. I didn’t imagine this.
XANDER	I know. I believe you. In fact, I’m starting to think, between this attack and the. thing at school, that somebody’s messing with you.
BUFFY	Really? You think they’re connected?
XANDER	Well, something’s going on. Think it’s worth checking into. And I don’t mean later. You need to see Giles and get on this right away. I’d start with IDing those demons...
BUFFY	You’re firing me, aren’t you?
XANDER	Big time. The whole melty thing should help narrow it down. Try sketching them, that always helps...
BUFFY	Is this all for research? Or some kind of stress test for the table?
GILES	I want to be thorough. The time-anomaly and the demon attack could be unrelated events, but if they’re not, you’re in some danger.
BUFFY	So, situation normal, then.
ANYA	Let’s review. You record returns here. And these are the forms for special orders, they’re shipped wherever the customer wants. And these are the hold slips.
GILES	Fill out two hold slips for each item.
WARREN	This is so dull I might actually have fallen asleep and be dreaming you guys.
ANDREW	Why’s the Slayer here anyway? She’s a student, she’s a construction worker, now she’s some kind of selling-stuff -person?
WARREN	I know. It’s like she’s completely without focus. Should we check the other channels for free cable porn?
JONATHAN	Guys. I’m ready.
ANDREW	With each other?
WARREN	You know what homophobia really means about you, don’t you?
JONATHAN	Stop touching my magic bone!
JONATHAN	(in bad Latin) Opus orbis est, et ea in medio. Tempus ad calcem intendit... JONATHAN (English translation) The task is a circle with her at the core. The time bends to the goal...
GILES	Buffy, a little advice. While I ran the store I found it helpful to imagine I was back in the library.
BUFFY	I guess I’ll find my own style.
GILES	Yes, yes. Quite right.
ANYA	That woman. Go sell her something.
CUSTOMER	Miss? Which candle creates a more, you know, romantic atmosphere?
BUFFY	Mmm. Lemon Seduction. Nice. Eerrhm. Essence of Slug.
CUSTOMER	I need something for a prosperity spell. I heard you had it --- A Mummy Hand.
BUFFY	Oh, I saw one downstairs, but it was kinda hairy. Probably a Daddy Hand. I’ll get it.
BUFFY	Petrified Hamsters, the Dagger of Lex, eyeballs in honey, Mummy hand.
BUFFY	And you get the Dagger of Lex for free. See the inlaid pearl there, um, under the oozing black goo?
CUSTOMER	This hand is dead. The power’s gone. I’m not giving you money for this.
BUFFY	It’s playing dead. Little scamp.
GILES	Buffy, a little advice...
BUFFY	Huh-what-huh?
WARREN	You did it, Dude! She’s looping! What d’ya do? Enchant the hand thing?
JONATHAN	Not exactly. I just made it so she has to satisfy a customer with a task that resists solving. I wonder if I should’ve done more.
ANDREW	Like what?
JONATHAN	I dunno. Like make her kinda itchy?
GILES	...more apt to satisfy the customer.
BUFFY	We did this just now. We already did this. Giles, something’s happening!
GILES	Yes, yes. Quite right.
ANYA	Go help the lady who just came in.
BUFFY	Wait
ANYA	Don’t be nervous. Do what I do. Picture yourself naked.
CUSTOMER	Miss?
CUSTOMER	Hi. I’m looking for something really specific. I heard you carry it-
BUFFY	Mummy Hand? You had that Mummy Hand look. Um... I’m sorry, I can’t get that for you.
CUSTOMER	I called twenty minutes ago and someone said you had one.
BUFFY	Yeah, but there’s a... there’s a thing happening...
CUSTOMER	You have one and I was told I could buy it and I’m sorry, but I really need to hold you to that. I’m not leaving ‘til l get a Mummy Hand.
BUFFY	Then... I guess... I guess I have to get it for you.
WARREN	Smart. She’s figuring out the game. Satisfy the customer. She might have you beat, Stretch.
JONATHAN	No way. She hasn’t even started yet.
ANDREW	I just hope she solves it faster than Data did on that ep of TNG where the Enterprise kept blowing up.
WARREN	Or Mulder, in that X-Files where the bank kept blowing up.
ANDREW	Scully wants me so bad.
BUFFY	Fingers sold separately.
ANYA	Where are you going?
BUFFY	That lady needs a Mummy Hand.
ANYA	What? You haven’t even talked to her!
BUFFY	Anya, I could explain. But you’d just forget it.
ANYA	I’m worried about you. Retail’s an exciting fast-paced world. Is this whole day going too quickly for you?
BUFFY	No. No, I don’t think that’s exactly the problem.
GILES	Say, Buffy, a piece of advice. If you think of the store as a library...
BUFFY	Yes! And then I’m gonna marry Bob Dole and raise penguins in Guam.
GILES	Yes, yes. Quite right.
CUSTOMER	Miss?
BUFFY	Mummy Hand, right? You got it, lady.
BUFFY	If you like slug, go with the slug. She’s not gonna sleep with you anyway.
WARREN	This Mummy Hand has ceased to be!
ANDREW	It is an ex-Mummy Hand!
GILES	Buffy, some advice --
BUFFY	It’s you! You’re doing this!
CUSTOMER	Ow!
BUFFY	I know we promised you a Mummy Hand. It’s just... I can’t get it for you. It’s... something’s wrong with it. It’s defective.
CUSTOMER	Defective? Are you sure? There must be something you can do. I simply can’t go without it.
CUSTOMER	Really?
BUFFY	Thanks for shopping at the Magic Box!
WARREN	Good job, Man.
ANDREW	So, Warren had two-twenty. And I had that bonus for getting her fired...
JONATHAN	But the biggest component has to be how long it took to finish. Mine took longest.
ANDREW	Only from a perspective external to the time loops. From, Mr. Giles’ perspective, it was shortest of all.
JONATHAN	So what do we do?
WARREN	It’s obvious. It’s not over.
GILES	Congratulations! Your first sale.
ANYA	You didn’t charge for delivery.
GILES	Oh dear. Well, it’s your first day. It was bound to happen.
ANYA	I’ll just take it out of your pay.
GILES	I’m sure Buffy understands that.
BUFFY	Absolutely.
BUFFY	This is gonna be great.
BUFFY	Life is stupid.
SPIKE	I have a dim memory of that, yeah. And I didn’t figure you were here cadging my whiskey cuz life is all blood and peaches.
BUFFY	There’s this thing-- someone’s doing stuff to me. Messing up my life. ‘Cept that it was kinda pre-messed already. School, and, and, jobs... pretty bad even without the evil.
SPIKE	So you’re just, what? Gonna let this -- whoever -- play you ‘til it figures out what kills you?
BUFFY	Giles is working on it.
SPIKE	Oh, good. Cuz Giles, he wields the Mighty Force of Library Books.
BUFFY	You’d do better?
SPIKE	Damn right. I’d hit the demon world. Ask questions, throw punches, find out what’s in the air. Fun, too.
BUFFY	‘S not my kind of fun.
SPIKE	Yeah. It is. And your life’s gonna get a lot less confusing when you figure that out.
BUFFY	Bleeeegh.
SPIKE	You’re not a schoolgirl. You’re not a shop girl. You’re a creature of darkness, like me. Try on my world, see how good it feels.
BUFFY	Are there drinks in your world?
BUFFY	Your motorcycle is loud.
BARTENDER	Ssspike.
SPIKE	My usual, Dave. And one for the lady. (to Buffy) We’re headin’ for the back room, pet. ‘S where the real action is.
SPIKE	These lowlifes know everything happens in this town.
BUFFY	Oh good, these are the lowlifes.
SPIKE	Fine. Little louder.
DEMON	You know the game, Spike. You in?
DEMON	He kills our kind. Don’t let him in.
BUFFY	Ask him if he’s heard --
SPIKE	Later.
BUFFY	You’re gonna play cards?
SPIKE	I need a moment with my lady.
BUFFY	You wanna play, that’s fine. I’m sticking to the plan. Who do I kill first to get information?
SPIKE	Listen. These guys talk while they play. We’ll get more information out of their mouths than out of gaping holes in their corpses.
DEMON	Ante up.
BUFFY	Kittens?! You’re playing for kittens?
SPIKE	So who wants to advance me a tiny tabby, get me started? C’mon, someone’s gotta stake me.
BUFFY	I’ll do it.
JONATHAN	Where are we going?
WARREN	To Final Jeopardy. Where Buffy’s the one in Jeopardy.
ANDREW	We’re really supervillains now. Like Dr. No.
WARREN	Yeah. Back when Bond was Connery and the movies were decent.
JONATHAN	Who even remembers Connery? I mean, Roger Moore was smooth.
WARREN	You’re insane. Short and insane.
ANDREW	I like Timothy Dalton.
WARREN	Don’t make me pull over, okay?
DEMON	You’re lucky today, Spike.
SPIKE	Got my good luck charm with me.
BUFFY	Bleeeegh.
DEMON	You cleaned us out. No one’s that lucky.
DEMON	I’m starting to think you cheat.
SPIKE	Me? I cheat? He’s got X-ray vision!
DEMON	I’m not using it.
DEMON	We’re not the ones cheating!
I	coulda leaned on that days ago.
DEMON	Better go, Spike. This could get ugly.
DEMON	Got ugly the second he walked in. Him and his human.
DEMON	Her skin’s so tight I don’t know how you even look at her.
DEMON	Leave your winnings and get out! We’ll forget the whole thing.
SPIKE	Ahh! It’s a set-up, in’t it? Squeeze a few quid outta the vamp? Tell you what you didn’t count on, though. Me and the bird. You want a fight, you face the two of us.
BUFFY	I’m not getting into a bar fight! I’ll beat ‘em up for information, great! But not to defend your right to gamble for kittens! Which, by the way, is a stupid currency!
DEMON	They’ re delicious.
SPIKE	C’mon, Slayer! A big fight’s just what you need!
BUFFY	Forget it. ‘M not playing by anyone else’s rules anymore. I’m done.
DEMONS	No! / Hey! / The money’s getting away!
BUFFY	Scamper! Be free!
SPIKE	I won those!
SPIKE	What’s wrong, love?
BUFFY	What’s wrong? You were gonna help me! You were gonna beat heads and fix my life! But you’re c’mpletely lame! Tonight sucks! And look at me! Look at Stupid Buffy! Too dumb for college! And, and, and Freak Buffy! Too strong for construction work! Then there was the store. I was bored to tears even before the hour that wouldn’t die! And the only person I can even stand to be with anymore is a neutered vampire who cheats at Kitten-Poker!
SPIKE	Oh. Saw the cheating, did you?
BUFFY	Also, I think you’re drunk.
WARREN	Connery is Bond. He had style.
JONATHAN	But Roger Moore was funny.
WARREN	Moonraker?! The gondola turns into a hovercraft? Retarded! And the guy had, like, no edge.
ANDREW	Dalton had edge. In License to Kill, he was a rogue agent. That’s edgy. And he was amazing in The Living Daylights.
JONATHAN	Which was written for Roger Moore, not Timothy Dalton.
BUFFY	That van.
SPIKE	You wanna steal a van, I’m with you, love. But we have got the motorbike.
BUFFY	I’ve seen it before. At the construction site.
WARREN	Connery’s the only actor of the bunch.
ANDREW	Timothy Dalton should get an Oscar and beat Sean Connery over the head with it!
WARREN	Okay. That’s it.
JONATHAN	Stop it! Guys! No!
ANDREW	She’s coming over! What do we do?
WARREN	Jonathan. Grab your magic bone.
DEMON	Rrrrrrgg! You have discovered me! Do not even try to defeat me, for I have been testing you and know all your weaknesses!
BUFFY	‘M okay. I got it. Get off me.
DEMON	I am well struck! I call upon the misty portal to my demon dimension. There to lay my head and gently die.
BUFFY	He blew up. Did you see it?
SPIKE	I saw. He’s gone.
BUFFY	Gotta love that. Makes ya feel strong, ya know? Powerful... Kinda sick...
DEMON	She hurt me all over.
WARREN	Someone’ll see you! Get in the back!
DEMON	I won’t fit. Big-ass wings. Also, big ass.
ANDREW	Well, do the thing!
DEMON	Oh. Right. Let, the spell be ended.
JONATHAN	Next time I do that spell, one of you guys has to look like a demon.
ANDREW	The Slayer touched you.
JONATHAN	Yeah, that was sexy the way she touched me real hard with her fists. I only look big, I actually have the proportional strength of... me.
WARREN	Guys. Think about this. We took on the Slayer. We’ve got all kinds of stuff in the computer now. Speed, strength, reaction time. We’re getting what we need to really be a threat to her. We tested her, faced her, and we survived.
JONATHAN	Unless I have internal injuries that will eventually kill me.
ANDREW	Oh of course, but barring that, Warren’s right. We did good.
WARREN	The trio vs. the Slayer. It’s not over.
ANDREW	Plus look what Warren and me discovered by accident right before we drove away...
JONATHAN	What?
GILES	Feel better?
BUFFY	For a second there I actually turned completely inside out. But yeah, better.
GILES	I’m sorry I didn’t find this demon with my research. I’d like to have saved you the fight.
BUFFY	That’s okay. It wasn’t much of a fight. I got lucky.
GILES	You were being sequentially tested by an unknown demon. I don’t see how that’s screwing up.
BUFFY	No, it completely is. Because I let it set the rules. And even worse, I let all you guys do the same thing! Do this thing, be this way, blah blah.
GILES	Well, that is an extremely awkward transition to me giving you advice. But I will. Go easy on yourself, won’t you? You don’t need to figure it out all at once, a job and all. You’re pushing yourself too hard.
BUFFY	The nice people at the phone company seem to think it’s not hard enough.
GILES	Well, I may be able to do something about that. I, this, this is for you.
BUFFY	A check - - Giles, I can’t take this. It’s too much.
GILES	Fine. I’ll just tear it up then, shall I?
BUFFY	I was just being polite. I’m taking the money. This is great. More than great. Like, I don’t really know how to say this... I guess, it’s a little like having Mom back.
GILES	This is a scenario in which I am your mother?
BUFFY	Wanna be my shiftless absentee father?
GILES	Is there some sort of rakish uncle in this mapping?
BUFFY	I’m just saying... Giles, thank you. So much.
BUFFY	Yep. Me. And I picked up dinner. Deep fried chicken parts.
GILES	No! Um, well... Yes, obviously.
DAWN	We didn't know when you'd be coming back.
BUFFY	S'okay. More for me.
TARA	Well, I don't know about everybody else, but I'd love some chicken.
GILES	Yes. As would I.
DAWN	I'll take a drumstick.
WILLOW	I'm a breast girl myself. But then you all know that.
DAWN	So...?
BUFFY	What, so?
DAWN	So, how was it? Seeing Angel? Him seeing you. Was it weird?
WILLOW	Well, if you want to talk about it...
BUFFY	I don't. It's...not important. It's past. So I'll just keep this one to myself, if that's okay.
GILES	Buffy, there was some discussion during your absence about... Well, about what you're going to do now. Your plans.
BUFFY	Oh, yeah. Thought a lot about that. And I'm pretty sure I figured out what it is I should be doing.
WILLOW	Good. That's good.
BUFFY	Yeah. Got it all wired. I'll hold off paying the plumber right away, use the money to pay the utility bills, that way I can wait to re- shingle the roof until--
GILES	I mean... With your life.
BUFFY	Oh. Life plans. I, uh... have no idea. I mean, I guess... Well, I left school when Mom got sick. Always figured I'd go back later. But then she... So I was thinking of reenrolling for the Fall. But I missed the registration cut- off, busy being dead and all...
WILLOW	Well, even if it's too late for late enrollment, and too early for early, you could still come to classes with Tara and me.
TARA	Right. You can audit for the rest of the semester, until registration.
BUFFY	Audit. Okay. That seems like a... pretty good plan. I guess. I mean, sure. I could do that. Right? What--what do you think, Giles?
JONATHON	Sharp, decisive. Always with a plan. We are never gonna become the Crime Lords of Sunnydale with her always one step ahead of us.
WARREN	Got nine high-resolution surveillance cameras hooked in: Super wide angle, infrared, autoiris... Plus six kinds of audio matrix monitoring, filtered through a dual quad DVR system and --
JONATHON	Yeah, fine, just tell me... You sure, with all this stuff, we'll be able to watch Buffy without her noticing us?
WARREN	Absolutely. She'll never know we're-- (sees something) What the hell is that?!
ANDREW	Death Star, dude. Wicked, huh.
JONATHON	Uh, Thermal Exhaust Port's above the Main Port, numbnuts.
ANDREW	For your information, I was using the Empire;s revised design from Return of the Jedi .
JONATHON	That's a flawed--
WARREN	Hey!! The thing is... Since we're messing with the Slayer, who could pummel the three of us into a sludgy substance, it might be a good idea NOT to draw ATTENTION TO OURSELVES !
ANDREW	I could paint over it, if you--
WARREN	Do that! 'Cause this time tomorrow, the games begin...
BUFFY	I mean, I thought it might be weird being back. And, it is, a little but it's a good kind of weird.
WILLOW	Oh, there's the teacher. Mike.
BUFFY	You call your teacher "Mike?" Wow. School sure has changed since my day.
BUFFY	Will, I'm not following this too well.
WILLOW	The trick is to just get into the rhythm, go with the flow.
BUFFY	Flow-going might be easier if your classmates weren't all big brains.
WILLOW	Buffy, that’s ridiculous. They’re no smarter than you or me.
WILLOW	Because social phenomena don’t have unproblematic objective existences, they have to be interpreted and given meanings by those who encounter them.
WILLOW	You’re not dumb. Just... rusty.
BUFFY	Maybe I should ease back in with some nice, breezy, non-taxing classes. Like “Introduction to Pies.” Or “Advanced Walking.”
TARA	Hey, how’d it go?
WILLOW	She did fine. Sociology not a big fave.
TARA	She didn’t like Mike?
BUFFY	Look, it’s okay. Just have to do a little more reacclimating than I thought. You know, get back up to speed so I can catch up to-- Oof!
WARREN	Francis Seven, this is Logan Five. I’m in position. Do you copy?
JONATHAN	And you’re up on the monitor.
ANDREW	Hey, Warren. This is working great.
JONATHAN	Ohhhh./I was gonna guess that.
WARREN	Is it working? Is it doing it?
JONATHAN	Dude. It’s doing it.
ANDREW	And it’s wicked cool.
TARA	Buffy. Where’ve you been? You missed art class - -
BUFFY	Missed--? Tara, something freaky’s going on. It’s like I’m losing --
ANDREW	Uh oh.
JONATHAN	She found it. Self destruct! Self destruct!
JONATHAN	Right. Fifty points for ingenuity. Another thirty since it involved actual contact.
ANDREW	Very smooth, by the way.
JONATHAN	On the freakometer, I’d say she was at a six.
WARREN	C’mon, eight! Easy!
JONATHAN	Eh. We’ll split the dif. Call it a seven. Which is good for 140. Giving you a grand total of...
ANDREW	Two Hundred and Twenty.
BUFFY	Diving right into the work force. Being the breadwinner. Building things with my hands.
XANDER	Uh, actually, your hands won’t be building so much as they’ll be lifting and toting.
BUFFY	Toting?
XANDER	It’s just a temp gig, Buf. You know, unless it takes. Since you're not union, I had to call in a few favors to get you on a crew.
BUFFY	Well, I appreciate it. Muchly. You saved me from having to accept Giles’ offer to work at the magic shop. I mean, retail...? Gaaah. I’d rather be dead. Again.
XANDER	Uh-huh. So, Giles have any thoughts about that little fast-forward freak-out you had at school?
BUFFY	No. Well, he implied it might have been stress related. Like I imagined it or something. I don’t know. Maybe... I guess I could’ve been blacking out. Although I did find this thing stuck to my sweater that went poof. Or blew away. Could’ve been lint. Or maybe evil lint...
XANDER	Okay, first tip of the day: when I introduce you to Tony, the foreman... You may wanna leave out stuff about blacking out and evil lint.
XANDER	Tony... This is Buffy. You know, the friend I told you about.
BUFFY	Nice to meet you, Tony.
TONY	You gotta be kidding me. We’re a week behind, I got two men out on the DL and now you want us to baby-sit some little girl.
BUFFY	Uh, excuse me, but--
TONY	Hang on, Gidget. This stinks Harris. What am I supposed to --
XANDER	Give her a chance. She's stronger than she looks.
BUFFY	What? Wait! Where are you going?
XANDER	Upstairs. Gotta supervise the sheet rock hangers. Don't sweat it. I'll check in later.
VINCE	Gee, I dunno, Tone. I mean, I don't wanna get in trouble with any of those Affirmative Action lawyers. I say you put Britney here on hauling duty.
BUFFY	It’s “Buffy.”
BUFFY	“Break a nail?”
VINCE	Wanna take a look at these blueprints? You know, since you’re into learning.
BUFFY	Um, okay. Sure.
WARREN	It is if you’re facing the front of the van.
JONATHAN	But we’re not facing the front of the van. We’re facing out that way. That’s 12. So she’s at 11.
WARREN	She’s over there, okay?!
JONATHAN	Okay!
ANDREW	Aw, man. She took ‘em out.
WARREN	Lemme see.
ANDREW	Okay, give ‘em back now.
WARREN	I’m still looking.
ANDREW	You had your turn, give me the --
BUFFY	I didn’t do that!
TONY	Came over to tell your friend I was impressed with the job she was doing, liking the way she handles herself... Then, all of a sudden, she goes berserk and attacks me.
BUFFY	What? No! I was saving you... There-- There were...
XANDER	Here? No. Not here. Not at my job. That’s your job.
BUFFY	I can’t help where the forces of darkness attack me, Xander.
XANDER	Buffy, look at this mess! You have any idea how much it’s gonna cost to repair this? What am I supposed to say to the clients? Should I just show them the demon bodies and say it’s all their fault?
BUFFY	Can’t. They melted.
BUFFY	What?! You-- You were huddled in the corner. Crying. Like a baby.
VINCE	Hey!
BUFFY	Xander. I didn’t imagine this.
XANDER	I know. I believe you. In fact, I’m starting to think, between this attack and the. thing at school, that somebody’s messing with you.
BUFFY	Really? You think they’re connected?
XANDER	Well, something’s going on. Think it’s worth checking into. And I don’t mean later. You need to see Giles and get on this right away. I’d start with IDing those demons...
BUFFY	You’re firing me, aren’t you?
XANDER	Big time. The whole melty thing should help narrow it down. Try sketching them, that always helps...
BUFFY	Is this all for research? Or some kind of stress test for the table?
GILES	I want to be thorough. The time-anomaly and the demon attack could be unrelated events, but if they’re not, you’re in some danger.
BUFFY	So, situation normal, then.
ANYA	Let’s review. You record returns here. And these are the forms for special orders, they’re shipped wherever the customer wants. And these are the hold slips.
GILES	Fill out two hold slips for each item.
WARREN	This is so dull I might actually have fallen asleep and be dreaming you guys.
ANDREW	Why’s the Slayer here anyway? She’s a student, she’s a construction worker, now she’s some kind of selling-stuff -person?
WARREN	I know. It’s like she’s completely without focus. Should we check the other channels for free cable porn?
ANDREW	With each other?
WARREN	You know what homophobia really means about you, don’t you?
BUFFY	I guess I’ll find my own style.
GILES	Yes, yes. Quite right.
CUSTOMER	Miss? Which candle creates a more, you know, romantic atmosphere?
BUFFY	Mmm. Lemon Seduction. Nice. Eerrhm. Essence of Slug.
CUSTOMER	I need something for a prosperity spell. I heard you had it --- A Mummy Hand.
BUFFY	Oh, I saw one downstairs, but it was kinda hairy. Probably a Daddy Hand. I’ll get it.
BUFFY	And you get the Dagger of Lex for free. See the inlaid pearl there, um, under the oozing black goo?
CUSTOMER	This hand is dead. The power’s gone. I’m not giving you money for this.
GILES	Buffy, a little advice...
BUFFY	Huh-what-huh?
WARREN	You did it, Dude! She’s looping! What d’ya do? Enchant the hand thing?
JONATHAN	Not exactly. I just made it so she has to satisfy a customer with a task that resists solving. I wonder if I should’ve done more.
ANDREW	Like what?
JONATHAN	I dunno. Like make her kinda itchy?
GILES	...more apt to satisfy the customer.
BUFFY	We did this just now. We already did this. Giles, something’s happening!
GILES	Yes, yes. Quite right.
ANYA	Go help the lady who just came in.
BUFFY	Wait
ANYA	Don’t be nervous. Do what I do. Picture yourself naked.
CUSTOMER	Hi. I’m looking for something really specific. I heard you carry it-
BUFFY	Mummy Hand? You had that Mummy Hand look. Um... I’m sorry, I can’t get that for you.
CUSTOMER	I called twenty minutes ago and someone said you had one.
BUFFY	Yeah, but there’s a... there’s a thing happening...
CUSTOMER	You have one and I was told I could buy it and I’m sorry, but I really need to hold you to that. I’m not leaving ‘til l get a Mummy Hand.
BUFFY	Then... I guess... I guess I have to get it for you.
WARREN	Smart. She’s figuring out the game. Satisfy the customer. She might have you beat, Stretch.
JONATHAN	No way. She hasn’t even started yet.
ANDREW	I just hope she solves it faster than Data did on that ep of TNG where the Enterprise kept blowing up.
WARREN	Or Mulder, in that X-Files where the bank kept blowing up.
ANDREW	Scully wants me so bad.
ANYA	Where are you going?
BUFFY	That lady needs a Mummy Hand.
ANYA	What? You haven’t even talked to her!
BUFFY	Anya, I could explain. But you’d just forget it.
ANYA	I’m worried about you. Retail’s an exciting fast-paced world. Is this whole day going too quickly for you?
BUFFY	No. No, I don’t think that’s exactly the problem.
BUFFY	Yes! And then I’m gonna marry Bob Dole and raise penguins in Guam.
GILES	Yes, yes. Quite right.
WARREN	This Mummy Hand has ceased to be!
ANDREW	It is an ex-Mummy Hand!
BUFFY	I know we promised you a Mummy Hand. It’s just... I can’t get it for you. It’s... something’s wrong with it. It’s defective.
CUSTOMER	Defective? Are you sure? There must be something you can do. I simply can’t go without it.
CUSTOMER	Really?
WARREN	Good job, Man.
ANDREW	So, Warren had two-twenty. And I had that bonus for getting her fired...
JONATHAN	But the biggest component has to be how long it took to finish. Mine took longest.
ANDREW	Only from a perspective external to the time loops. From, Mr. Giles’ perspective, it was shortest of all.
JONATHAN	So what do we do?
WARREN	It’s obvious. It’s not over.
GILES	Congratulations! Your first sale.
ANYA	You didn’t charge for delivery.
GILES	Oh dear. Well, it’s your first day. It was bound to happen.
ANYA	I’ll just take it out of your pay.
GILES	I’m sure Buffy understands that.
BUFFY	Absolutely.
BUFFY	Life is stupid.
SPIKE	I have a dim memory of that, yeah. And I didn’t figure you were here cadging my whiskey cuz life is all blood and peaches.
BUFFY	There’s this thing-- someone’s doing stuff to me. Messing up my life. ‘Cept that it was kinda pre-messed already. School, and, and, jobs... pretty bad even without the evil.
SPIKE	So you’re just, what? Gonna let this -- whoever -- play you ‘til it figures out what kills you?
BUFFY	Giles is working on it.
SPIKE	Oh, good. Cuz Giles, he wields the Mighty Force of Library Books.
BUFFY	You’d do better?
BUFFY	‘S not my kind of fun.
SPIKE	Yeah. It is. And your life’s gonna get a lot less confusing when you figure that out.
BUFFY	Bleeeegh.
SPIKE	You’re not a schoolgirl. You’re not a shop girl. You’re a creature of darkness, like me. Try on my world, see how good it feels.
SPIKE	These lowlifes know everything happens in this town.
BUFFY	Oh good, these are the lowlifes.
SPIKE	Fine. Little louder.
DEMON	You know the game, Spike. You in?
DEMON	He kills our kind. Don’t let him in.
SPIKE	Later.
BUFFY	You’re gonna play cards?
BUFFY	Kittens?! You’re playing for kittens?
SPIKE	So who wants to advance me a tiny tabby, get me started? C’mon, someone’s gotta stake me.
BUFFY	I’ll do it.
JONATHAN	Where are we going?
WARREN	To Final Jeopardy. Where Buffy’s the one in Jeopardy.
ANDREW	We’re really supervillains now. Like Dr. No.
WARREN	Yeah. Back when Bond was Connery and the movies were decent.
JONATHAN	Who even remembers Connery? I mean, Roger Moore was smooth.
WARREN	You’re insane. Short and insane.
ANDREW	I like Timothy Dalton.
WARREN	Don’t make me pull over, okay?
DEMON	You’re lucky today, Spike.
SPIKE	Got my good luck charm with me.
BUFFY	Bleeeegh.
DEMON	You cleaned us out. No one’s that lucky.
DEMON	I’m starting to think you cheat.
SPIKE	Me? I cheat? He’s got X-ray vision!
DEMON	I’m not using it.
I	coulda leaned on that days ago.
DEMON	Better go, Spike. This could get ugly.
DEMON	Got ugly the second he walked in. Him and his human.
DEMON	Her skin’s so tight I don’t know how you even look at her.
DEMON	Leave your winnings and get out! We’ll forget the whole thing.
SPIKE	Ahh! It’s a set-up, in’t it? Squeeze a few quid outta the vamp? Tell you what you didn’t count on, though. Me and the bird. You want a fight, you face the two of us.
BUFFY	I’m not getting into a bar fight! I’ll beat ‘em up for information, great! But not to defend your right to gamble for kittens! Which, by the way, is a stupid currency!
DEMON	They’ re delicious.
SPIKE	C’mon, Slayer! A big fight’s just what you need!
BUFFY	Forget it. ‘M not playing by anyone else’s rules anymore. I’m done.
DEMONS	No! / Hey! / The money’s getting away!
BUFFY	Scamper! Be free!
SPIKE	I won those!
SPIKE	What’s wrong, love?
BUFFY	What’s wrong? You were gonna help me! You were gonna beat heads and fix my life! But you’re c’mpletely lame! Tonight sucks! And look at me! Look at Stupid Buffy! Too dumb for college! And, and, and Freak Buffy! Too strong for construction work! Then there was the store. I was bored to tears even before the hour that wouldn’t die! And the only person I can even stand to be with anymore is a neutered vampire who cheats at Kitten-Poker!
SPIKE	Oh. Saw the cheating, did you?
BUFFY	Also, I think you’re drunk.
WARREN	Connery is Bond. He had style.
JONATHAN	But Roger Moore was funny.
WARREN	Moonraker?! The gondola turns into a hovercraft? Retarded! And the guy had, like, no edge.
ANDREW	Dalton had edge. In License to Kill, he was a rogue agent. That’s edgy. And he was amazing in The Living Daylights.
JONATHAN	Which was written for Roger Moore, not Timothy Dalton.
BUFFY	That van.
SPIKE	You wanna steal a van, I’m with you, love. But we have got the motorbike.
BUFFY	I’ve seen it before. At the construction site.
WARREN	Connery’s the only actor of the bunch.
ANDREW	Timothy Dalton should get an Oscar and beat Sean Connery over the head with it!
WARREN	Okay. That’s it.
ANDREW	She’s coming over! What do we do?
WARREN	Jonathan. Grab your magic bone.
BUFFY	He blew up. Did you see it?
SPIKE	I saw. He’s gone.
BUFFY	Gotta love that. Makes ya feel strong, ya know? Powerful... Kinda sick...
DEMON	She hurt me all over.
WARREN	Someone’ll see you! Get in the back!
DEMON	I won’t fit. Big-ass wings. Also, big ass.
ANDREW	Well, do the thing!
DEMON	Oh. Right. Let, the spell be ended.
JONATHAN	Next time I do that spell, one of you guys has to look like a demon.
ANDREW	The Slayer touched you.
JONATHAN	Yeah, that was sexy the way she touched me real hard with her fists. I only look big, I actually have the proportional strength of... me.
WARREN	Guys. Think about this. We took on the Slayer. We’ve got all kinds of stuff in the computer now. Speed, strength, reaction time. We’re getting what we need to really be a threat to her. We tested her, faced her, and we survived.
JONATHAN	Unless I have internal injuries that will eventually kill me.
ANDREW	Oh of course, but barring that, Warren’s right. We did good.
WARREN	The trio vs. the Slayer. It’s not over.
ANDREW	Plus look what Warren and me discovered by accident right before we drove away...
JONATHAN	What?
GILES	Feel better?
BUFFY	For a second there I actually turned completely inside out. But yeah, better.
GILES	I’m sorry I didn’t find this demon with my research. I’d like to have saved you the fight.
BUFFY	That’s okay. It wasn’t much of a fight. I got lucky.
GILES	You were being sequentially tested by an unknown demon. I don’t see how that’s screwing up.
BUFFY	No, it completely is. Because I let it set the rules. And even worse, I let all you guys do the same thing! Do this thing, be this way, blah blah.
GILES	Well, that is an extremely awkward transition to me giving you advice. But I will. Go easy on yourself, won’t you? You don’t need to figure it out all at once, a job and all. You’re pushing yourself too hard.
BUFFY	The nice people at the phone company seem to think it’s not hard enough.
GILES	Well, I may be able to do something about that. I, this, this is for you.
BUFFY	A check - - Giles, I can’t take this. It’s too much.
GILES	Fine. I’ll just tear it up then, shall I?
BUFFY	I was just being polite. I’m taking the money. This is great. More than great. Like, I don’t really know how to say this... I guess, it’s a little like having Mom back.
GILES	This is a scenario in which I am your mother?
BUFFY	Wanna be my shiftless absentee father?
GILES	Is there some sort of rakish uncle in this mapping?
BUFFY	I’m just saying... Giles, thank you. So much.

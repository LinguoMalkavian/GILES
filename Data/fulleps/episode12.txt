XANDER	You know how I feel about you. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? There's never been anyone else for me but you.
XANDER	We're already good friends, and I'm ready to take the next step. Would you... date me? Oh, that's good! "Date me". It's terrible. Right?
WILLOW	Huh? Oh. No. Yes. "Date me" is silly.
XANDER	You know what I should do is I should start with talking about the dance. You know, Buffy, Spring Fling isn't just any dance. It's a time when the students all sort of choose a... a mate, and, and we can observe their mating ritual and tag them before they migrate. Just kill me.
WILLOW	You're doing fine.
XANDER	Why is this so hard? I should just go up to her and say "I like you, will you go to the dance with me."
WILLOW	Direct and to the point.
XANDER	I'm ready! I wanna do it now. I gotta do it now.
WILLOW	Buffy's not here. You could practice on me some more...
XANDER	I can't wait till tomorrow -- I'll be thinking about it too much. Why didn't Buffy show up tonight? What's she doing?
WILLOW	Oh, you know. The usual.
CORDELIA	What was that?
KEVIN	What was what?
CORDELIA	Somebody's out there.
KEVIN	That's silly. Who would be out there?
CORDELIA	We could get in trouble, okay? I don't want to be grounded right before the dance. I AM the May Queen. Which means we get the first dance.
KEVIN	The first -- the last -- (kisses her) -- and all the ones in between.
BUFFY	Three in one night. Giles would be so proud.
GILES	Ho korias phanaytie toutay tay nuktee. The Master shall rise... Yes, this is it. The Master shall rise, and the Slayer...
GILES	My God.
GILES	Oh... no...
XANDER	Under the stairs!
MASTER	Yes! YES! Shake, earth! Crack open to bring forth my unholy issue! This is a sign: we are in the final days!
MASTER	My ascension is at hand! My time is come! Glory! Gloryl
MASTER	What do you think? 5.1?
BUFFY	Morning. Wow. That damage looks fairly structural. Are we safe in here?
GILES	Buffy...
BUFFY	Do I have something on my face?
GILES	No... and yes, we're safe.
BUFFY	How're you doing there, Giles? You get much sleep?
GILES	I've been working.
BUFFY	Me too! Yes I went hunting last night and it's awfully sweet of you to ask.
BUFFY	It's getting hairy out there, Giles. I killed three vampires last night. One of them was practically on school grounds.
GILES	Their numbers are increasing.
BUFFY	And they're getting cockier. I'm not loving it. Last night was a pretty close call.
GILES	Yes...
BUFFY	Giles, CARE. I'm putting my life on the line, battling the undead! I broke a nail, okay? I'm wearing a press-on. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest. You could go, "Hmmmm" .
GILES	I'm sorry. I'm glad you're all right but I need to verify... I just can't talk right now.
BUFFY	That's okay. I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet my terrible fate.
GILES	What?
BUFFY	Biology.
BUFFY	Wow, that was... boring.
XANDER	I don't feel that boring covers it.
BUFFY	No, "boring" falls short.
WILLOW	Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.
BUFFY	Don't say that.
WILLOW	I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age; nerds are in. They're still in, right?
XANDER	Willow, don't you have a thing?
WILLOW	A thing? The thing! That I have! Which is a thing. I have to go to it. See you later!
BUFFY	What on earth is her deal?
XANDER	She's Willow. So Buffy! I wanted to -- there was a thing I wanted to ask you. To talk to you about.
BUFFY	Okay. What's up?
XANDER	Why don't we sit down. Over here.
BUFFY	Okay, now you're making me nervous.
XANDER	There's nothing to be nervous about, silly. Ha.
XANDER	Hey. Leave.
BUFFY	Well?
XANDER	You know, Buffy, Spring Fling is a time for students to gather and -- oh, God. Buffy, I want you to go to the dance with me. You and me. On a date.
BUFFY	Xander, I don't know what to say...
XANDER	Well, you're not laughing, so that's a good start. Buffy, I like you. A lot. I mean, we're friends, and we've shared experiences, we've fought blood sucking fiends together, and that's a good time, but... I want more than that. I wanna dance with you.
BUFFY	Xander... You're one of my best friends. The best friends I've ever had. You and Willow, I mean, I love you guys so much --
XANDER	Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is she's playing it really close to the chest.
BUFFY	I don't want to spoil the friendship we have.
XANDER	I don't want to spoil it either. But that's not the point, is it? You either feel a thing or you don't.
BUFFY	I don't. I'm sorry. I just don't think of you that way.
XANDER	Well, try. I'll wait.
BUFFY	Xander...
XANDER	No. Forget it. I'm not him. I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
BUFFY	That's really harsh.
XANDER	I'm sorry. I don't handle rejection well. Funny, considering how much practice I've had.
BUFFY	I never meant to --
XANDER	You know what? Let's just not.
XANDER	Figures.
GILES	Hello?... Yes, this is Rupert Giles. -- Yes I have. It's, um -- I need to talk to you. Here. -- No, I realize that. Come after sundown.
CALENDAR	Hey. Bad time?
GILES	Not the best.
CALENDAR	You know, that outfit looks just like the one you wore yesterday, only wrinklier. Were you here all night?
GILES	I'm sorry, but I'm really not up to socializing right now.
GILES	What do you know?
CALENDAR	I've been surfing the net, looking for unexplained incidents. People are always sending stuff my way; they know the occult's my turf. Here's the latest. A cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes. Which promptly ate her. Family was swimming in Whisper Lake when the lake suddenly began to boil. Two deaths. Mercy hospital, last night. A boy was born with his eyes facing inward.
GILES	Where did these take place? What countries?
CALENDAR	That's the great thing about the net. You're connected to the whole wide world. Except these things all happened within three miles of here.
CALENDAR	I'm not stupid. This is apocalypse stuff. You throw in last night's earthquake and today's impromptu rendition of "Singing in the Gravel" and I'd say we've got a problem. I'd say the end is pretty seriously nigh.
GILES	I don't know if I can trust you.
CALENDAR	I helped you cast that demon out of the internet, I think that merits some trust. I'm scared, okay? Plus I got this crazy monk in Cortona E-mailing me about some Anointed One.
GILES	The Anointed One? But he's dead...
CALENDAR	Someone's dead?
GILES	Who is this Monk?
CALENDAR	Brother Luca something. Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.
GILES	I need you to talk to him. Find out everything he knows.
CALENDAR	Rupert, you haven't told me jack, so what's with the orders?
GILES	Just do it. And then I'll explain.
GILES	I will.
KEVIN	I'll get everything tonight after practice. The guys'll help me.
CORDELIA	It's all in the AV room. The sound system, the decorations -- and Aura needs help moving the coolers.
KEVIN	Don't sweat it.
CORDELIA	Bring it to the Bronze and I'll meet you there in the morning to set it up.
KEVIN	Done.
CORDELIA	You are so sweet. Why are you so sweet?
KEVIN	I don't know. 'Cause usually I'm mean as a snake.
CORDELIA	Willow! I'll see you in the morning. Willow! Hi. I like your outfit.
WILLOW	No you don't.
CORDELIA	No, I really don't. But I need a favour.
WILLOW	What kind?
CORDELIA	The Bronze isn't letting us use their sound system and so I need someone who knows how to hook one up.
CORDELIA	If you could just show up tomorrow morning I'd be really grateful, I mean I'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
WILLOW	Sure.
CORDELIA	Great. Tomorrow at ten.
WILLOW	Sure.
WILLOW	Hey.
XANDER	Hey.
WILLOW	How'd it go?
XANDER	On a scale of one to ten, it sucked.
WILLOW	Oh.
XANDER	Well, it could be worse. I could have gangrene on my face.
WILLOW	Well, what did she say?
XANDER	Apart from "no?" Does it really matter? She's still jonesing over Angel and she could care less about me. So I made a big fool of myself.
WILLOW	At least now you know.
XANDER	You're right. The deal is done. No more waiting, worrying -- the polls are in and it's time for my concession speech.
XANDER	You know what we'll do? We'll go. You and me. Be my date. We'll have a great time. We'll dance, we'll get wild. What do you say?
WILLOW	No.
XANDER	Good! What?
WILLOW	There's no way.
XANDER	Willow, come on --
WILLOW	You think I'm gonna spend an evening with you watching you wish you were spending an evening with her? You think that's my idea of high jinks? You should know better.
XANDER	I'm, uh... I didn't think...
WILLOW	I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. I'll see you Monday.
XANDER	That's okay. I don't want to go to the dance. I'll just go home, lie down, and listen to country music, the music of pain.
BUFFY	Giles? You're not gonna believe --
BUFFY	Angel...?
ANGEL	It can't be. You've got to be wrong.
GILES	I've checked it against every volume I have. It's real.
ANGEL	Well, there's got to be some way around it.
GILES	Some prophecies are dodgey. Mutable. Buffy herself has thwarted them time and again. But this is the Pergamum Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
ANGEL	Then you're reading it wrong.
GILES	I wish to God I were. But it's very plain. Tomorrow night, Buffy will face the Master. And she will die.
BUFFY	So that's it, huh? My time is up. I remember the drill. "One Slayer dies, the next is called." I wonder who the next one is. Are you gonna train her? Or will they send someone else.
GILES	Buffy, I...
BUFFY	Does it say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt?
BUFFY	Don't touch me!
BUFFY	Were you guys even gonna tell me?
GILES	I was hoping I wouldn't have to. That there was some way around it.
BUFFY	Oh, I've got a way around it. I quit.
ANGEL	It's not that simple.
BUFFY	I'm making it that simple! I quit! I resign! I'm fired! Someone else can stop the Master from taking over.
GILES	I don't know that anyone else can. The signs all indicate --
BUFFY	The signs?
BUFFY	Read me the signs! Tell me my fortune! You're so useful, sitting around with your books. You're really a lot of help.
GILES	I don't suppose I am.
ANGEL	I know this is hard...
BUFFY	What do you know about it? You're never gonna die.
ANGEL	You think I want anything to happen to you? Do you think I could stand it? We just have to figure out a way --
BUFFY	I already have. I quit, remember? Pay attention.
GILES	Buffy, if the Master rises --
BUFFY	I don't care! I don't care. I'm sixteen years old. And I don't want to die.
MASTER	Soon...
MASTER	Soon.
JOYCE	Hey, honey. You all right?
BUFFY	I guess.
JOYCE	You're probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had. Feel like telling me what's on your mind?
BUFFY	Mom, let's go away.
JOYCE	What?
BUFFY	Anywhere. Just for a while. A weekend.
JOYCE	Honey...
BUFFY	It'll be great. You and me. A mother daughter thing. We'll talk about all that embarrassing stuff you like to bring up.
JOYCE	You know the gallery's open on weekends.
BUFFY	Mom... please?
JOYCE	Isn't the prom tomorrow night? Or Spring Fling, or whatever they're calling it?
BUFFY	I guess so.
JOYCE	Nobody asked you?
BUFFY	Someone, but...
JOYCE	Not the right someone. See? Sometimes I actually do know what you're thinking. Well, I suppose then this isn't the best time for this, but...
JOYCE	I saw you eying it at the store. I figured...
BUFFY	Mom, we can't afford this.
JOYCE	The way you've been eating? We can afford it.
BUFFY	It's beautiful.
JOYCE	I think you should wear it. To the dance.
BUFFY	I can't go to the dance.
JOYCE	Says who? Is it written somewhere? You should do what you want. Homecoming, my freshman year at college, I didn't have a date. So I got dressed up and I went anyway.
BUFFY	Was it awful?
JOYCE	It was awful. For about an hour.
BUFFY	Then what happened?
JOYCE	I met your father.
BUFFY	And he didn't have a date either?
JOYCE	He did, and that's a much funnier story that you will not get to hear. But it was a beautiful night.
BUFFY	You had your whole life ahead of you.
JOYCE	Yeah.
BUFFY	That must be nice.
COLLIN	He said you lived like one of them. I don't understand it.
ANGEL	Maybe when you're older.
COLLIN	People are weak. They're stupid. Why would you want to be one?
ANGEL	Did he send you?
COLLIN	He's coming. Soon. Stay out of his way.
ANGEL	Why should I?
COLLIN	Because he doesn't like you anymore.
COLLIN	You know what he could do to you...
ANGEL	Yes...
COLLIN	No you don't.
CORDELIA	Kevin said he'd bring everything to the Bronze last night. He promised! We'll never get everything ready in time.
WILLOW	He probably forgot. It's not that big a deal.
CORDELIA	You don't understand. I'm not mad. He totally flaked on me - on me - and I don't even mind. God help me, I think it's cute.
CORDELIA	There they are.
CORDELIA	They're watching cartoons. That's so - (stopping herself) it's not cute. It's annoying. I'm annoyed.
WILLOW	Right. I'm furious.
CORDELIA	Men. I don't know why we put up with them.
CORDELIA	Well Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
JOYCE	Buffy!
JOYCE	There's something on the news. Willow.
WILLOW	I've seen so much, I thought I could take anything. But Buff.... This was... this was different, it...
BUFFY	It's okay...
WILLOW	I'm trying to think how to say it. To explain it so you understand.
BUFFY	Willow, as long as you're okay --
WILLOW	I'm not okay. I can't imagine what it's like to be okay. I knew those guys. I go to that room every day. And when I walked in there, it was... It wasn't our world anymore. They made it theirs. And they had fun.
WILLOW	What are we gonna do?
BUFFY	What we have to.
BUFFY	You'll stay in tonight, all right?
WILLOW	I tried to reach Xander, but he's not picking up. I'll go by his house tomorrow. We'll get together and figure out what to do.
BUFFY	Tomorrow.
WILLOW	Buffy. I like your dress.
BUFFY	Take care.
CALENDAR	So this master guy tried to open the Hellmouth, and he got stuck in it. And now all the signs are reading that he's gonna get out. Which opens the Hellmouth, which brings the demons, which ends the world.
GILES	Precisely.
CALENDAR	The part that gets me is where Buffy's the vampire Slayer. She's so little.
GILES	Don't let that fool you. All right. I've told you enough. Did you get in touch with Brother Luca?
CALENDAR	As far as I can tell, nobody can. He's disappeared. He did send out one last global, though. Short one.
GILES	What did it say?
CALENDAR	"Isaiah. 11.6." Which I dutifully looked up.
GILES	"The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them."
CALENDAR	You know your text.
GILES	Yes... "A little child shall lead them..."
CALENDAR	It's kind of warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.
GILES	Depends on where he's leading them to. Aurelius wrote of the Anointed one, "the Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into Hell".
CALENDAR	So Luca thinks the Anointed is a kid?
GILES	If the vampire Buffy killed was not in fact the Anointed, it may well be.
CALENDAR	Well then we should warn her.
GILES	I don't plan to involve her at all.
CALENDAR	What do you mean?
GILES	Buffy isn't going to face the Master. I am.
BUFFY	No you're not.
BUFFY	So I'm looking for a kid, huh? He'll take me to the Master.
GILES	Buffy, I'm not sending you out there to die. You were right. I've waded about in these old books for so long I've forgotten what the real world is like. It's time I found out.
BUFFY	You're still not going up against the Master.
GILES	I've made up my mind.
BUFFY	So have I.
GILES	Well, I made up mine first. And I'm older and wiser and just do as I say for once. All right?
BUFFY	It's not how it goes. I'm the Slayer.
GILES	I don't care what the books say. I defy prophecy. I'm going. Nothing you can say will change my mind.
BUFFY	I know.
BUFFY	When he wakes up, tell him... I don't know. Think of something cool, tell him I said it.
CALENDAR	You fight the Master, you'll die.
BUFFY	Maybe... But maybe I'll take him with me.
COLLIN	Help me...
BUFFY	It's all right. I know who you are.
BUFFY	Let's go.
XANDER	She WHAT?
WILLOW	I knew it. I told you something was going on with her.
XANDER	And she knew about this prophecy of yours? Oh, MAN! What do we do?
GILES	We stay calm, first thing.
XANDER	Calm!?
WILLOW	I think he's right.
XANDER	I'm sorry -- Staying calm may work fine for Locutus of the Borg here but I'm freaked out and I plan to stay that way.
WILLOW	Xander --
XANDER	How could you let her go?
GILES	As the soon-to-be-purple area on my jaw will indicate, I did not let her go. Buffy does as she will.
WILLOW	Well, how can we help her?
CALENDAR	I'm sorry to bring this up but we've also got an apocalypse to worry about.
XANDER	Do you mind?
WILLOW	How come she's in the club?
CALENDAR	Hey, once the Master gets free, the Hellmouth opens. The demons come to party and everybody dies. We have to prepare. Rupert, you know I'm right.
XANDER	I don't care. I'm sorry, I don't. I gotta help Buffy.
GILES	But we don't even know where she's gone.
XANDER	No. But I can find out.
WILLOW	Xander...
ANGEL	Well. Look who's here.
XANDER	Mind if I come in?
ANGEL	Everybody's visiting lately. I really should clean the place up.
XANDER	She's gone.
ANGEL	What do you mean?
XANDER	Buffy. She's going right now to fight the Master.
ANGEL	He'll kill her.
XANDER	Rumour has it. Only we're not gonna let that happen.
ANGEL	What do you propose we do about it?
XANDER	I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground, right? Some old church? Take me to him.
ANGEL	You're way out of your league, kid. The Master'll kill you before you can breathe -- if you're lucky.
XANDER	How can I say this clearly?
XANDER	I don't like you. At the end of the day I pretty much think you're a vampire. But Buffy, man, she's got a big ol' yen for you. I don't get it. She thinks you're a real person. Right now I need you to prove her right.
ANGEL	You're in love with her.
XANDER	Aren't you?
GILES	The Master is as old as any vampire on record. There's no way to tell how powerful he will be if he reaches the surface.
GILES	Yes?
CALENDAR	Where? If he's underground, and it's right where he is, where's it gonna open?
GILES	Good point. Check through the Black Chronicles, and, uh, Willow -- Willow.
WILLOW	Huh?
GILES	Can you look through the town histories please? Search for any common denominators. Location of incidents and such.
WILLOW	Right. Okay.
CALENDAR	How big is a Hellmouth, anyway?
GILES	I don't know. Hellmouth-sized.
MASTER	Welcome.
BUFFY	Thanks for having me. You really ought to talk to your contractor. I think you've got some water damage.
MASTER	Ah, good. The feeble banter portion of the fight. Darling, why don't we just cut to the --
MASTER	Nice shot.
ANGEL	What.
XANDER	You were looking at my neck.
ANGEL	What?
XANDER	You were checking out my neck! I saw that.
ANGEL	No I wasn't.
XANDER	You just keep your distance, pal.
ANGEL	I wasn't looking at your neck!
XANDER	I told you to eat before we left.
MASTER	You're not going to kill me with that thing.
BUFFY	Don't be so sure.
MASTER	You still don't understand your part in all this, do you? You're not the hunter. You're the lamb.
CALENDAR	I've got nothing specific in here.
GILES	Nor I. The Vampires have been gathering. They know he's coming. They will be his army.
CALENDAR	You think they'll gather at the Hellmouth?
WILLOW	Well, the last time the Master tried to rise was the Harvest. He sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood. Maybe this is the same.
CALENDAR	Where did that go down?
GILES	The Bronze.
WILLOW	The prom.
CALENDAR	We've got to warn them.
GILES	You two go. I'll concentrate on Demon killing.
CALENDAR	My car's in the lot.
GILES	Stay close together. And be careful.
WILLOW	We will.
BUFFY	For somebody all-powerful, you sure do like to hide.
BUFFY	I don't.
MASTER	I understand.
WILLOW	What if they get to the Bronze before us?
CALENDAR	Don't worry about it.
WILLOW	Don't worry? Why not?
CALENDAR	'Cause they're not going to the Bronze.
CALENDAR	What do we do now?
WILLOW	I vote panic.
MASTER	You tried. It was noble of you. You heard the prophecy that I was going to break free and you came to stop me. But prophecies are tricky creatures. They didn't tell you everything.
MASTER	You're the one that frees me. If you hadn't come, I couldn't go. Think about that.
MASTER	God, the power!
MASTER	By the way....
MASTER	I like your dress.
XANDER	What is that?
ANGEL	It's too late. He's gone up.
XANDER	Come on. Come on!
ANGEL	She's dead.
XANDER	She's not dead.
ANGEL	She's not breathing...
XANDER	If she drowned there's a shot. CPR. You have to do it. I have no breath.
XANDER	Come on. Come on.
CALENDAR	Why are they coming here?
WILLOW	Not caring...
CORDELIA	Get in!
XANDER	Breathe!
XANDER	Buffy?
BUFFY	Xander... ?
XANDER	Welcome back.
CORDELIA	I was sitting where Kevin and I used to park, and suddenly these things were coming at me -- I tried to get out but the gate's locked. Who are these guys?
CORDELIA	What do we do?
WILLOW	We've got to get to the library.
CORDELIA	Library. Right. Great.
WILLOW	Of course, we generally walk there...
GILES	What's going on?
GILES	But why are they coming here?
MASTER	My world. My beautiful world.
XANDER	Easy...
BUFFY	The Master...
XANDER	Buffy, you're still weak.
BUFFY	No, I'm not. I feel strong. I feel... different.
BUFFY	Let's go.
GILES	They're coming in through the stacks!
WILLOW	The bookshelves!
GILES	My office.
CORDELIA	OWWW!! Somebody HELP!
XANDER	How do you know where the Master's going?
BUFFY	I know.
BUFFY	Oh, look. A bad guy.
BUFFY	You wait here. Keep the rest of the vampires off me.
XANDER	Right.
BUFFY	Angel, better put on your game face.
ANGEL	I'm ready.
BUFFY	One way or another, this won't take long.
CORDELIA	See how YOU like it.
WILLOW	This won't keep them out for long!
GILES	The Hellmouth...
MASTER	Yes... come forth. My child... Come into my world.
BUFFY	I don't think it's yours just yet.
MASTER	You... are dead.
BUFFY	I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.
MASTER	You were destined to die! It was written.
BUFFY	What can I say? I flunked the written.
MASTER	Come here.
CALENDAR	Giles! Gape later!
MASTER	Do you really think you can best me here, when you couldn't below?
BUFFY	You've got fruit punch mouth.
MASTER	What?
BUFFY	And save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.
ANGEL	Ooh! Ow! Hot!
XANDER	Sorry.
MASTER	Where are your jibes now? Will you laugh when my Hell is on earth?
BUFFY	You're really that amped about Hell?
BUFFY	Go there.
GILES	The vampires?
CORDELIA	Gone.
ANGEL	The Master?
GILES	Dead. And the Hellmouth has closed. Buffy?
BUFFY	I'm sorry. It's been a really weird day.
XANDER	Yeah, Buffy died and everything.
WILLOW	Wow. Harsh.
GILES	I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
CALENDAR	Well, what do we do now?
GILES	I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd really like to get out of this library. I hate it here.
XANDER	I hear there's a dance over at the Bronze. Could be fun...
CORDELIA	Yeah!
WILLOW	Buffy?
BUFFY	Sure. We saved the world. I say we party. (looks at her tattered dress) I mean, I got all pretty...
CALENDAR	What about him?
BUFFY	He's not going anywhere. Loser.
GILES	I'm not dancing, though.
CALENDAR	We'll see.
XANDER	So what's the story with the car?
CORDELIA	Oh, that was me saving the day.
BUFFY	I'm hungry. Is anybody else hungry? I'm really hungry.
WILLOW	You can come with us, Angel. Get something to drink. Or, no... don't do that. Just hang out.
XANDER	We're already good friends, and I'm ready to take the next step. Would you... date me? Oh, that's good! "Date me". It's terrible. Right?
WILLOW	Huh? Oh. No. Yes. "Date me" is silly.
XANDER	You know what I should do is I should start with talking about the dance. You know, Buffy, Spring Fling isn't just any dance. It's a time when the students all sort of choose a... a mate, and, and we can observe their mating ritual and tag them before they migrate. Just kill me.
WILLOW	You're doing fine.
XANDER	Why is this so hard? I should just go up to her and say "I like you, will you go to the dance with me."
WILLOW	Direct and to the point.
XANDER	I'm ready! I wanna do it now. I gotta do it now.
WILLOW	Buffy's not here. You could practice on me some more...
XANDER	I can't wait till tomorrow -- I'll be thinking about it too much. Why didn't Buffy show up tonight? What's she doing?
WILLOW	Oh, you know. The usual.
CORDELIA	What was that?
KEVIN	What was what?
CORDELIA	Somebody's out there.
KEVIN	That's silly. Who would be out there?
CORDELIA	We could get in trouble, okay? I don't want to be grounded right before the dance. I AM the May Queen. Which means we get the first dance.
KEVIN	The first -- the last -- (kisses her) -- and all the ones in between.
BUFFY	Do I have something on my face?
GILES	No... and yes, we're safe.
BUFFY	How're you doing there, Giles? You get much sleep?
GILES	I've been working.
BUFFY	Me too! Yes I went hunting last night and it's awfully sweet of you to ask.
BUFFY	It's getting hairy out there, Giles. I killed three vampires last night. One of them was practically on school grounds.
GILES	Their numbers are increasing.
BUFFY	And they're getting cockier. I'm not loving it. Last night was a pretty close call.
GILES	Yes...
BUFFY	Giles, CARE. I'm putting my life on the line, battling the undead! I broke a nail, okay? I'm wearing a press-on. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest. You could go, "Hmmmm" .
GILES	I'm sorry. I'm glad you're all right but I need to verify... I just can't talk right now.
BUFFY	That's okay. I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet my terrible fate.
GILES	What?
BUFFY	Biology.
BUFFY	Wow, that was... boring.
XANDER	I don't feel that boring covers it.
BUFFY	No, "boring" falls short.
WILLOW	Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.
BUFFY	Don't say that.
WILLOW	I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age; nerds are in. They're still in, right?
XANDER	Willow, don't you have a thing?
WILLOW	A thing? The thing! That I have! Which is a thing. I have to go to it. See you later!
BUFFY	What on earth is her deal?
XANDER	She's Willow. So Buffy! I wanted to -- there was a thing I wanted to ask you. To talk to you about.
BUFFY	Okay. What's up?
XANDER	Why don't we sit down. Over here.
BUFFY	Okay, now you're making me nervous.
XANDER	There's nothing to be nervous about, silly. Ha.
BUFFY	Well?
XANDER	You know, Buffy, Spring Fling is a time for students to gather and -- oh, God. Buffy, I want you to go to the dance with me. You and me. On a date.
BUFFY	Xander, I don't know what to say...
XANDER	Well, you're not laughing, so that's a good start. Buffy, I like you. A lot. I mean, we're friends, and we've shared experiences, we've fought blood sucking fiends together, and that's a good time, but... I want more than that. I wanna dance with you.
BUFFY	Xander... You're one of my best friends. The best friends I've ever had. You and Willow, I mean, I love you guys so much --
XANDER	Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is she's playing it really close to the chest.
BUFFY	I don't want to spoil the friendship we have.
XANDER	I don't want to spoil it either. But that's not the point, is it? You either feel a thing or you don't.
BUFFY	I don't. I'm sorry. I just don't think of you that way.
XANDER	Well, try. I'll wait.
BUFFY	Xander...
XANDER	No. Forget it. I'm not him. I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
BUFFY	That's really harsh.
XANDER	I'm sorry. I don't handle rejection well. Funny, considering how much practice I've had.
BUFFY	I never meant to --
XANDER	You know what? Let's just not.
CALENDAR	Hey. Bad time?
GILES	Not the best.
CALENDAR	You know, that outfit looks just like the one you wore yesterday, only wrinklier. Were you here all night?
GILES	I'm sorry, but I'm really not up to socializing right now.
GILES	What do you know?
CALENDAR	I've been surfing the net, looking for unexplained incidents. People are always sending stuff my way; they know the occult's my turf. Here's the latest. A cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes. Which promptly ate her. Family was swimming in Whisper Lake when the lake suddenly began to boil. Two deaths. Mercy hospital, last night. A boy was born with his eyes facing inward.
GILES	Where did these take place? What countries?
CALENDAR	That's the great thing about the net. You're connected to the whole wide world. Except these things all happened within three miles of here.
GILES	I don't know if I can trust you.
CALENDAR	I helped you cast that demon out of the internet, I think that merits some trust. I'm scared, okay? Plus I got this crazy monk in Cortona E-mailing me about some Anointed One.
GILES	The Anointed One? But he's dead...
CALENDAR	Someone's dead?
GILES	Who is this Monk?
CALENDAR	Brother Luca something. Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.
GILES	I need you to talk to him. Find out everything he knows.
CALENDAR	Rupert, you haven't told me jack, so what's with the orders?
GILES	Just do it. And then I'll explain.
GILES	I will.
KEVIN	I'll get everything tonight after practice. The guys'll help me.
CORDELIA	It's all in the AV room. The sound system, the decorations -- and Aura needs help moving the coolers.
KEVIN	Don't sweat it.
CORDELIA	Bring it to the Bronze and I'll meet you there in the morning to set it up.
KEVIN	Done.
CORDELIA	You are so sweet. Why are you so sweet?
KEVIN	I don't know. 'Cause usually I'm mean as a snake.
CORDELIA	Willow! I'll see you in the morning. Willow! Hi. I like your outfit.
WILLOW	No you don't.
CORDELIA	No, I really don't. But I need a favour.
WILLOW	What kind?
CORDELIA	The Bronze isn't letting us use their sound system and so I need someone who knows how to hook one up.
CORDELIA	If you could just show up tomorrow morning I'd be really grateful, I mean I'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
WILLOW	Sure.
CORDELIA	Great. Tomorrow at ten.
WILLOW	Sure.
WILLOW	Hey.
XANDER	Hey.
WILLOW	How'd it go?
XANDER	On a scale of one to ten, it sucked.
WILLOW	Oh.
XANDER	Well, it could be worse. I could have gangrene on my face.
WILLOW	Well, what did she say?
XANDER	Apart from "no?" Does it really matter? She's still jonesing over Angel and she could care less about me. So I made a big fool of myself.
WILLOW	At least now you know.
XANDER	You're right. The deal is done. No more waiting, worrying -- the polls are in and it's time for my concession speech.
WILLOW	No.
XANDER	Good! What?
WILLOW	There's no way.
XANDER	Willow, come on --
WILLOW	You think I'm gonna spend an evening with you watching you wish you were spending an evening with her? You think that's my idea of high jinks? You should know better.
XANDER	I'm, uh... I didn't think...
WILLOW	I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. I'll see you Monday.
ANGEL	It can't be. You've got to be wrong.
GILES	I've checked it against every volume I have. It's real.
ANGEL	Well, there's got to be some way around it.
GILES	Some prophecies are dodgey. Mutable. Buffy herself has thwarted them time and again. But this is the Pergamum Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
ANGEL	Then you're reading it wrong.
GILES	I wish to God I were. But it's very plain. Tomorrow night, Buffy will face the Master. And she will die.
BUFFY	So that's it, huh? My time is up. I remember the drill. "One Slayer dies, the next is called." I wonder who the next one is. Are you gonna train her? Or will they send someone else.
GILES	Buffy, I...
BUFFY	Were you guys even gonna tell me?
GILES	I was hoping I wouldn't have to. That there was some way around it.
BUFFY	Oh, I've got a way around it. I quit.
ANGEL	It's not that simple.
BUFFY	I'm making it that simple! I quit! I resign! I'm fired! Someone else can stop the Master from taking over.
GILES	I don't know that anyone else can. The signs all indicate --
BUFFY	The signs?
BUFFY	Read me the signs! Tell me my fortune! You're so useful, sitting around with your books. You're really a lot of help.
GILES	I don't suppose I am.
ANGEL	I know this is hard...
BUFFY	What do you know about it? You're never gonna die.
ANGEL	You think I want anything to happen to you? Do you think I could stand it? We just have to figure out a way --
BUFFY	I already have. I quit, remember? Pay attention.
GILES	Buffy, if the Master rises --
BUFFY	I don't care! I don't care. I'm sixteen years old. And I don't want to die.
JOYCE	Hey, honey. You all right?
BUFFY	I guess.
JOYCE	You're probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had. Feel like telling me what's on your mind?
BUFFY	Mom, let's go away.
JOYCE	What?
BUFFY	Anywhere. Just for a while. A weekend.
JOYCE	Honey...
BUFFY	It'll be great. You and me. A mother daughter thing. We'll talk about all that embarrassing stuff you like to bring up.
JOYCE	You know the gallery's open on weekends.
BUFFY	Mom... please?
JOYCE	Isn't the prom tomorrow night? Or Spring Fling, or whatever they're calling it?
BUFFY	I guess so.
JOYCE	Nobody asked you?
BUFFY	Someone, but...
JOYCE	Not the right someone. See? Sometimes I actually do know what you're thinking. Well, I suppose then this isn't the best time for this, but...
JOYCE	I saw you eying it at the store. I figured...
BUFFY	Mom, we can't afford this.
JOYCE	The way you've been eating? We can afford it.
BUFFY	It's beautiful.
JOYCE	I think you should wear it. To the dance.
BUFFY	I can't go to the dance.
JOYCE	Says who? Is it written somewhere? You should do what you want. Homecoming, my freshman year at college, I didn't have a date. So I got dressed up and I went anyway.
BUFFY	Was it awful?
JOYCE	It was awful. For about an hour.
BUFFY	Then what happened?
JOYCE	I met your father.
BUFFY	And he didn't have a date either?
JOYCE	He did, and that's a much funnier story that you will not get to hear. But it was a beautiful night.
BUFFY	You had your whole life ahead of you.
JOYCE	Yeah.
BUFFY	That must be nice.
COLLIN	He said you lived like one of them. I don't understand it.
ANGEL	Maybe when you're older.
COLLIN	People are weak. They're stupid. Why would you want to be one?
ANGEL	Did he send you?
COLLIN	He's coming. Soon. Stay out of his way.
ANGEL	Why should I?
COLLIN	Because he doesn't like you anymore.
COLLIN	You know what he could do to you...
ANGEL	Yes...
COLLIN	No you don't.
CORDELIA	Kevin said he'd bring everything to the Bronze last night. He promised! We'll never get everything ready in time.
WILLOW	He probably forgot. It's not that big a deal.
CORDELIA	You don't understand. I'm not mad. He totally flaked on me - on me - and I don't even mind. God help me, I think it's cute.
CORDELIA	They're watching cartoons. That's so - (stopping herself) it's not cute. It's annoying. I'm annoyed.
WILLOW	Right. I'm furious.
CORDELIA	Men. I don't know why we put up with them.
CORDELIA	Well Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
WILLOW	I've seen so much, I thought I could take anything. But Buff.... This was... this was different, it...
BUFFY	It's okay...
WILLOW	I'm trying to think how to say it. To explain it so you understand.
BUFFY	Willow, as long as you're okay --
WILLOW	I'm not okay. I can't imagine what it's like to be okay. I knew those guys. I go to that room every day. And when I walked in there, it was... It wasn't our world anymore. They made it theirs. And they had fun.
WILLOW	What are we gonna do?
BUFFY	What we have to.
WILLOW	I tried to reach Xander, but he's not picking up. I'll go by his house tomorrow. We'll get together and figure out what to do.
BUFFY	Tomorrow.
GILES	Precisely.
CALENDAR	The part that gets me is where Buffy's the vampire Slayer. She's so little.
GILES	Don't let that fool you. All right. I've told you enough. Did you get in touch with Brother Luca?
CALENDAR	As far as I can tell, nobody can. He's disappeared. He did send out one last global, though. Short one.
GILES	What did it say?
CALENDAR	"Isaiah. 11.6." Which I dutifully looked up.
GILES	"The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them."
CALENDAR	You know your text.
GILES	Yes... "A little child shall lead them..."
CALENDAR	It's kind of warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.
GILES	Depends on where he's leading them to. Aurelius wrote of the Anointed one, "the Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into Hell".
CALENDAR	So Luca thinks the Anointed is a kid?
GILES	If the vampire Buffy killed was not in fact the Anointed, it may well be.
CALENDAR	Well then we should warn her.
GILES	I don't plan to involve her at all.
CALENDAR	What do you mean?
GILES	Buffy isn't going to face the Master. I am.
BUFFY	No you're not.
BUFFY	So I'm looking for a kid, huh? He'll take me to the Master.
GILES	Buffy, I'm not sending you out there to die. You were right. I've waded about in these old books for so long I've forgotten what the real world is like. It's time I found out.
BUFFY	You're still not going up against the Master.
GILES	I've made up my mind.
BUFFY	So have I.
GILES	Well, I made up mine first. And I'm older and wiser and just do as I say for once. All right?
BUFFY	It's not how it goes. I'm the Slayer.
GILES	I don't care what the books say. I defy prophecy. I'm going. Nothing you can say will change my mind.
BUFFY	I know.
CALENDAR	You fight the Master, you'll die.
BUFFY	Maybe... But maybe I'll take him with me.
COLLIN	Help me...
BUFFY	It's all right. I know who you are.
XANDER	She WHAT?
WILLOW	I knew it. I told you something was going on with her.
XANDER	And she knew about this prophecy of yours? Oh, MAN! What do we do?
GILES	We stay calm, first thing.
XANDER	Calm!?
WILLOW	I think he's right.
XANDER	I'm sorry -- Staying calm may work fine for Locutus of the Borg here but I'm freaked out and I plan to stay that way.
WILLOW	Xander --
XANDER	How could you let her go?
GILES	As the soon-to-be-purple area on my jaw will indicate, I did not let her go. Buffy does as she will.
WILLOW	Well, how can we help her?
CALENDAR	I'm sorry to bring this up but we've also got an apocalypse to worry about.
XANDER	Do you mind?
WILLOW	How come she's in the club?
CALENDAR	Hey, once the Master gets free, the Hellmouth opens. The demons come to party and everybody dies. We have to prepare. Rupert, you know I'm right.
XANDER	I don't care. I'm sorry, I don't. I gotta help Buffy.
GILES	But we don't even know where she's gone.
XANDER	No. But I can find out.
XANDER	Mind if I come in?
ANGEL	Everybody's visiting lately. I really should clean the place up.
XANDER	She's gone.
ANGEL	What do you mean?
XANDER	Buffy. She's going right now to fight the Master.
ANGEL	He'll kill her.
XANDER	Rumour has it. Only we're not gonna let that happen.
ANGEL	What do you propose we do about it?
XANDER	I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground, right? Some old church? Take me to him.
ANGEL	You're way out of your league, kid. The Master'll kill you before you can breathe -- if you're lucky.
XANDER	How can I say this clearly?
ANGEL	You're in love with her.
XANDER	Aren't you?
GILES	The Master is as old as any vampire on record. There's no way to tell how powerful he will be if he reaches the surface.
GILES	Yes?
CALENDAR	Where? If he's underground, and it's right where he is, where's it gonna open?
GILES	Good point. Check through the Black Chronicles, and, uh, Willow -- Willow.
WILLOW	Huh?
GILES	Can you look through the town histories please? Search for any common denominators. Location of incidents and such.
WILLOW	Right. Okay.
CALENDAR	How big is a Hellmouth, anyway?
GILES	I don't know. Hellmouth-sized.
BUFFY	Thanks for having me. You really ought to talk to your contractor. I think you've got some water damage.
MASTER	Ah, good. The feeble banter portion of the fight. Darling, why don't we just cut to the --
ANGEL	What.
XANDER	You were looking at my neck.
ANGEL	What?
XANDER	You were checking out my neck! I saw that.
ANGEL	No I wasn't.
XANDER	You just keep your distance, pal.
ANGEL	I wasn't looking at your neck!
XANDER	I told you to eat before we left.
MASTER	You're not going to kill me with that thing.
BUFFY	Don't be so sure.
MASTER	You still don't understand your part in all this, do you? You're not the hunter. You're the lamb.
CALENDAR	I've got nothing specific in here.
GILES	Nor I. The Vampires have been gathering. They know he's coming. They will be his army.
CALENDAR	You think they'll gather at the Hellmouth?
WILLOW	Well, the last time the Master tried to rise was the Harvest. He sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood. Maybe this is the same.
CALENDAR	Where did that go down?
GILES	The Bronze.
WILLOW	The prom.
CALENDAR	We've got to warn them.
GILES	You two go. I'll concentrate on Demon killing.
CALENDAR	My car's in the lot.
GILES	Stay close together. And be careful.
WILLOW	We will.
BUFFY	I don't.
WILLOW	What if they get to the Bronze before us?
CALENDAR	Don't worry about it.
WILLOW	Don't worry? Why not?
CALENDAR	What do we do now?
WILLOW	I vote panic.
XANDER	What is that?
ANGEL	It's too late. He's gone up.
XANDER	Come on. Come on!
XANDER	She's not dead.
ANGEL	She's not breathing...
XANDER	If she drowned there's a shot. CPR. You have to do it. I have no breath.
CALENDAR	Why are they coming here?
WILLOW	Not caring...
CORDELIA	What do we do?
WILLOW	We've got to get to the library.
CORDELIA	Library. Right. Great.
GILES	What's going on?
BUFFY	The Master...
XANDER	Buffy, you're still weak.
BUFFY	No, I'm not. I feel strong. I feel... different.
GILES	They're coming in through the stacks!
XANDER	How do you know where the Master's going?
BUFFY	I know.
BUFFY	You wait here. Keep the rest of the vampires off me.
XANDER	Right.
BUFFY	Angel, better put on your game face.
ANGEL	I'm ready.
BUFFY	One way or another, this won't take long.
MASTER	Yes... come forth. My child... Come into my world.
BUFFY	I don't think it's yours just yet.
MASTER	You... are dead.
BUFFY	I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.
MASTER	You were destined to die! It was written.
BUFFY	What can I say? I flunked the written.
BUFFY	You've got fruit punch mouth.
MASTER	What?
GILES	The vampires?
CORDELIA	Gone.
ANGEL	The Master?
GILES	Dead. And the Hellmouth has closed. Buffy?
BUFFY	I'm sorry. It's been a really weird day.
XANDER	Yeah, Buffy died and everything.
WILLOW	Wow. Harsh.
GILES	I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
CALENDAR	Well, what do we do now?
GILES	I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd really like to get out of this library. I hate it here.
XANDER	I hear there's a dance over at the Bronze. Could be fun...
CORDELIA	Yeah!
WILLOW	Buffy?
BUFFY	Sure. We saved the world. I say we party. (looks at her tattered dress) I mean, I got all pretty...
CALENDAR	What about him?
GILES	I'm not dancing, though.
CALENDAR	We'll see.
XANDER	So what's the story with the car?
CORDELIA	Oh, that was me saving the day.
BUFFY	I'm hungry. Is anybody else hungry? I'm really hungry.
WILLOW	You can come with us, Angel. Get something to drink. Or, no... don't do that. Just hang out.

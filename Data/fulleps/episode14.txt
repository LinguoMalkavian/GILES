BUFFY	Come on, Stephan, rise and shine. Some of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
ANGEL	Hey--
BUFFY	Ack!
ANGEL	Is this a bad time?
BUFFY	Are you crazy? You don't just sneak up on people in a graveyard. You make noise when you walk. You... stomp, or... yodel.
ANGEL	I heard you were on the hunt.
BUFFY	Supposed to be. But lazybones here doesn't wanna come out and play.
ANGEL	When you first wake up, it's a little disorienting. He'll show.
BUFFY	It's weird to think of you going through that.
ANGEL	It's weird to go through. You're here alone?
BUFFY	Yeah, why?
ANGEL	I just thought you'd have somebody with you... Xander or someone.
BUFFY	Xander?
ANGEL	Or someone.
BUFFY	No, no Xander. Why, are you jealous?
ANGEL	Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.
BUFFY	Is it 'cause I danced with him?
ANGEL	"Danced with" is a pretty loose term. "Mated with" might be a little closer --
BUFFY	Oh, you're shocking! One little dance and you know I just did it to make you crazy which by the way behold my success!
ANGEL	I am not jealous!
BUFFY	Oh, you're not jealous. What, vampires don't get jealous?
ANGEL	See? Whenever we fight, you always bring up the vampire thing.
BUFFY	I didn't come here to fight.
ANGEL	I didn't touch your stake...
BUFFY	And what do you mean, "He's just a kid." Does that mean I'm just a kid too?
ANGEL	Look, obviously I made a mistake coming here tonight...
BUFFY	Oh, no you don't. You can't just turn and walk away. It takes more then that to get rid of me...
BUFFY	I wish people wouldn't leave open graves laying around like this.
ANGEL	So another vampire has risen tonight.
BUFFY	I don't think so. Whoever was buried here didn't rise from this grave...
GILES	So, what I'm proposing... and I don't mean to appear indecorous... is a social engagement... a date, if you will. If you're amenable... Idiot!
BUFFY	Boy. I guess we just never realized how much you liked that chair.
GILES	Oh, I, uh, I was just working on--
BUFFY	Your pick-up lines?
GILES	In a manner of speaking, yes.
BUFFY	Then, if you don't mind a little Gene and Roger, I would leave off the "idiot" part. Being called an idiot tends to take a person out of the dating mood.
XANDER	Actually, it kind of turns me on.
BUFFY	I fear you. I'd also avoid words like "amenable" and "indecorous." Speak English, not whatever they speak in...
GILES	England?
BUFFY	Yeah. Just say, "Hey, I got a thing, you're maybe feeling a thing, and there could be a thing."
GILES	Well, thank you, Cyrano.
BUFFY	I'm not finished. Then you say, "How do you feel about Mexican?"
GILES	About Mexicans?
BUFFY	Mexican! Food. You take her for food. For which you then pay.
GILES	Right.
XANDER	So, this "chair" woman? We are talking Ms. Calendar, right?
GILES	What makes you think that?
XANDER	Simple deduction: Ms. Calendar is reasonably dollsome, especially for someone in your age bracket; she already knows you're a school librarian, so you don't have to worry about how to break that embarrassing news to her...
BUFFY	And she's the only woman we've ever actually seen speaking to you. Add it all up, it spells "duh."
XANDER	Now, is it time for us to talk about the facts of life?
GILES	I am suddenly deciding that this is none of your business.
XANDER	'Cause that whole stork thing is a smokescreen...
GILES	So, how did things go last night? Did Mr. Korshack show up on schedule?
BUFFY	More or less. Angel and I took care of him.
XANDER	Angel.
BUFFY	There's something else, though. I found an empty grave.
GILES	Another vampire?
BUFFY	No, no. It was dug up, and the body was taken out.
GILES	Grave robbing. Well, that's new. Interesting.
BUFFY	I know that you meant to say "gross and disturbing".
GILES	Yes of course. Terrible thing. Must put a stop to it. Dammit.
XANDER	So why does someone rob graves?
GILES	I'll collate some theories. Might help to know who the body belonged to.
BUFFY	Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?
XANDER	Drawing a blank.
GILES	Well, perhaps Willow can fire up the machine (points at computer) and track Meredith down.
ERIC	Look at those legs...
WILLOW	No thank you.
CHRIS	Eric, knock it off.
WILLOW	Hey, Chris. I was just wondering what you're going to do this year.
CHRIS	Why?
WILLOW	Well, every year, you win and I place second. I just thought I'd see what I'm up against.
CHRIS	You know what the key is? If Dr. Clark doesn't understand your experiment, he gives it higher marks so it looks like he understands your experiment. (reads Willow's clipboard) "Effects of Subviolet Light Spectrum Deprivation on the Development of Fruit Flies." (smiles, friendly) That should do the trick.
CORDELIA	Okay, I'm doing this under protest. It is not fair that they're making participation in the Science Fair mandatory this year. I don't think anyone should have to do anything educational at school if they don't want to.
WILLOW	"The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable?"
CORDELIA	I want something I can finish in a weekend, okay?
ERIC	Come on. The camera loves you.
CORDELIA	I thought yearbook nerds didn't come out of hibernation till the spring.
ERIC	It's for my private collection.
CHRIS	Eric, will you quit it?
BUFFY	Coming through. Hey, Willow, sorry to interrupt, but.. it's the Bat Signal.
WILLOW	Sure, okay. See you, Chris. Thanks for the tip.
ERIC	Cordelia is so fine. You know, she'd be just perfect for us...
CHRIS	Don't be an idiot. She's alive.
WILLOW	This shouldn't take long. I'm probably the only girl in school who has the Coroner's Office bookmarked as a "favorite place."
CORDELIA	Hi. Sorry to interrupt your little undead play group, but I need to ask Willow if she'll help me with my Science Fair project.
WILLOW	It's a fruit.
CORDELIA	I would ask Chris for help, but... (a little emotional) it would bring back too many memories of Daryl.
WILLOW	I found it...
CORDELIA	Of course, I've learned to deal with my pain...
BUFFY	And how was her neck?
WILLOW	Fine... except for being broken.
CORDELIA	Hello? Can we deal with my pain please?
XANDER	There there.
WILLOW	It says Meredith and two other girls in the car were killed instantly. They were all on the pep squad at Fondren High, on the way to a game.
BUFFY	You know what this means...
XANDER	That Fondren might actually beat Sunnydale in the cross-town body count competition this year?
BUFFY	It means she wasn't killed by vampires. So somebody did dig up her corpse.
CORDELIA	Eeuw. Why is it that every conversation you people have has the word "corpse" in it?
XANDER	So, okay, we got us a body snatcher. What does that mean?
GILES	Here's what I've come up with: demons who eat the flesh of the dead to absorb their souls. Or it could be a voodoo practitioner--
WILLOW	You mean, making a zombie?
GILES	More likely, zombies. For most traditional purposes, a voodoo priest would need more than one.
BUFFY	So we should see if the other girls from this accident are AWOL, too. Might help figure out what this creep has in mind if we know whether he's dealing in volume.
XANDER	So we dig up some graves tonight?
WILLOW	Oh boy, a field trip! Are you gonna call Angel?
BUFFY	I don't think so.
XANDER	Yeah, why bother him?
BUFFY	We've been sort of... never mind. As far as Angel knows, I'm taking the night off. Okay?
XANDER	So, we're all set, then. Say nine-ish, B.Y.O. shovel.
WILLOW	I'll pack some food. Who likes those little powdered donuts?
CORDELIA	Darn, I have Cheerleader practice tonight. Boy, I wish I'd known you were gonna be digging up dead people sooner; I would have cancelled.
XANDER	All right. But if you do run into the army of zombies, could you page us before they eat your flesh?
GILES	Xander, Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
XANDER	I know, but did you see her face?
BUFFY	He was getting all jealous and he wouldn't even admit it.
WILLOW	Jealous of what?
BUFFY	Of Xander.
WILLOW	'Cause you did that sexy dance with him?
BUFFY	Am I ever gonna live that down?
WILLOW	Nope.
BUFFY	Anyway, Angel's being totally irrational.
WILLOW	Love makes you do the wacky.
BUFFY	That's the truth.
XANDER	You know, this might go faster if you fems picked up a shovel, too.
BUFFY	Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned girl. I was raised to believe the men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies. Speaking of the wacky, what was Cordelia's whole riff about painful memories? Who's Daryl?
WILLOW	Daryl Epps. Chris's older brother. He was a big football star. All-State two years ago. A running... someone that runs and catches.
BUFFY	Was he a studly?
WILLOW	Big time. All the girls were crazy for him.
BUFFY	And he broke Cordy's heart? Thus possibly proving its existence...
WILLOW	He died. Rock climbing, or something. He fell.
BUFFY	Oh, man. That's lousy. Poor Chris.
WILLOW	He really looked up to his brother. It was tough. Ever since then he's been... real quiet. Kind of in his own world. And I hear his mother doesn't even leave the house anymore.
GILES	I think we're there.
WILLOW	By the way, are we hoping to find a body, or no body?
XANDER	Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping to find a fortune in gold dubloons.
BUFFY	Well, "body" could mean flesh eating demon or corpse-mutilating pagan ritual. "No body" points more toward the army of zombies thing. Take your pick.
GILES	Go ahead.
XANDER	You're closer.
BUFFY	Pathetic much?
CORDELIA	Guys, if we don't have it down by tomorrow then no one will be led by our cheers. Practice.
ANGEL	Cordelia. This is the last place I expected you to hang out.
CORDELIA	Oh, god... oh, god, it's you. Why were you following me?
ANGEL	I wasn't sure it was you at first. I'm looking for Buffy.
CORDELIA	Buffy? Well, she's -- big shock -- at the graveyard.
ANGEL	She said she'd be home.
CORDELIA	Oh, she lied. Isn't she a rascal?
XANDER	So, both coffins empty, that makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.
WILLOW	Is it an army if you just have three?
BUFFY	Well, Zombie drill team then --
BUFFY	Angel...?
ANGEL	Xander.
XANDER	Angel.
ANGEL	I thought you were taking the night off.
BUFFY	I was... going to. But, at the last minute- -
ANGEL	Cordelia told me the truth.
XANDER	That's gotta be a first.
BUFFY	We were investigating... somebody's been stealing the bodies of dead girls.
ANGEL	I know. We found some of them.
BUFFY	You mean like two of the three?
ANGEL	I mean, like some of them. Like parts.
CORDELIA	It was horrible. Angel saved me from an arm.
XANDER	Karma!
WILLOW	Well, so much for the zombie theory.
GILES	So much for all our theories.
BUFFY	I don't get it. Why dig up three bodies, just to chop them up and throw them away again?
ANGEL	What I saw didn't add up to three whole girls. I think they kept some parts.
BUFFY	Could this get yuckier?
WILLOW	They probably kept the other parts to eat.
BUFFY	Question answered.
GILES	But why dispose of the remains here at the school?
BUFFY	Maybe whoever did it had other business in the neighborhood. Like, say... classes.
ANGEL	This was no hatchet job. Whoever made those incisions really knew what they were doing.
GILES	Yes, what student here would be that well-versed in physiology?
WILLOW	I can think of maybe five or six guys in the science club.
BUFFY	Why don't you get their locker numbers, and we'll check 'em out.
CORDELIA	No, I want to go home now. I have to bathe and burn my clothes.
XANDER	Everybody wave bye-bye.
CORDELIA	I don't want to go alone. I'm still fragile. (to Angel) Can you take me?
ANGEL	I...
CORDELIA	Great! I'll drive.
XANDER	How about that? I always pegged him as a "one woman" vampire.
WILLOW	Xander!
CHRIS	I'm going out, mom.
GILES	I hope you understand that as a school official, I can not condone this unauthorized search.
BUFFY	Okay, your butt's covered. You want to grab a locker?
GILES	Yes of course.
BUFFY	Okay, Eric, let's see what's on your mind.
WILLOW	Nothing but back issues of "Scientific American." Ooh, I haven't read this one.
GILES	Nothing remarkable here...
XANDER	Your friend, Chris Epps' locker.
WILLOW	"Gray's Anatomy", "Mortician's Desk Reference", "Robicheaux's Guide to Muscles and Tendons".
GILES	Fair to say, Chris is involved.
XANDER	He's into corpses, all right, but we still don't know why.
BUFFY	Yes we do.
ERIC	I GUESS, YOU'D SAY, WHAT CAN MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY. MY GIRL... How's my baby?
CHRIS	She's not your baby.
ERIC	She's not gonna be anyone's baby if we don't finish her soon.
CHRIS	I'm working on it.
ERIC	So am I, friend. So am I.
XANDER	Any sign of our suspects?
BUFFY	Not yet.
XANDER	You mean, when there's so many pre-made ones just lying around? The things we do for love...
BUFFY	Love has nothing to do with this.
XANDER	Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: People don't fall in love with what's right in front of them. People want the dream. What they can't have. The more unattainable, the more attractive.
WILLOW	And for Eric the unattainable would include everyone. That's alive.
BUFFY	Eric's sick enough to do something like this, but what's up with Chris? He seems like a human person.
WILLOW	I don't know. The thing with his brother was really hard on him; He talked a lot about death. Maybe he just wants to get one up on it.
BUFFY	But, it's not... doable, is it? I mean, making someone from scraps? Actually making them live?
WILLOW	If it is, my science project's definitely coming in second this year.
XANDER	And speaking of love...
WILLOW	We were talking about the reanimation of dead tissue.
XANDER	Do I deconstruct your segues? Yeesh.
BUFFY	Hey, Giles
GILES	Oh. Yes. Hello.
BUFFY	Still no sign of our mad doctors.
GILES	What? Oh. Corpses. Evil. Very good.
BUFFY	Okay, Giles, just remember. "I'm feeling a thing, you're feeling a thing." But personalize it.
GILES	Personalize it?
BUFFY	She's a techno-pagan, right? Ask her to bless your laptop or something. Come on, guys.
GILES	No! Don't leave me! Oh, dear.
CALENDAR	Good morning, Rupert.
GILES	Ms. Calendar.
CALENDAR	Please, call me Jennie. "Ms." Calendar is my father.
GILES	You know, uh, Jenny, I don't mean to appear indecorous... no, not indecorous...
CALENDAR	Yeah...?
GILES	Oh, dear... I, uh... that is...
GILES	Well, what I am proposing is...
CALENDAR	Sorry, but I really have to go.
GILES	Idiot...
CALENDAR	Listen, if it's important, why don't you just tell me at the game?
GILES	You're going to the football game?
CALENDAR	You seem surprised.
GILES	I guess I just assumed you spent your evenings downloading incantations... casting bones.
CALENDAR	On game night? Are you nuts? I assume you're going, too.
GILES	Oh, uh, of course.
CALENDAR	So, why don't we just go together? I could pick you up after school, we could get something to eat on the way, if you like. How do you feel about Mexican?
GILES	Okay... tonight, then.
WILLOW	I still don't get how Chris could do it. Arresting the cell deterioration is one thing, but...
XANDER	Hello... I want to get ahead!
WILLOW	Maybe an electrical current combined with an adrenaline boost...
XANDER	For the love of God, somebody scratch my nose!
BUFFY	Well, it's official. Chris and Eric didn't come to school today.
XANDER	That's not a coincidence.
WILLOW	Maybe they finished their project.
BUFFY	God, what if it worked, what if that poor girl is walking around...
XANDER	Uh, poor girls, technically.
BUFFY	What could she be thinking?
WILLOW	And what are they... going to do with her?
GILES	I don't think we have to worry about that just yet.
BUFFY	And they only had three girls.
WILLOW	So they don't have the whole, uh, package.
XANDER	Heads must be no good. Hrnmmm, they seemed attractive enough to me... obviously I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.
GILES	Based on what the police put together, they're one step away from completing their masterpiece.
WILLOW	One step...
ERIC	If we wait too long, the onset of atrophy in the limbs will be irreversible.
CHRIS	We can turn up the current. That'll buy us a day at least.
ERIC	We'll lose the entire body if we don't attach the head soon!
CHRIS	We have time!
ERIC	We don't! The crash with the girls was lucky. But we can't keep waiting for another lucky accident to just drop a head in our laps. You know what we have to do! Hell, it's just one lousy girl!
CHRIS	I won't do it... I can't I can't... kill anyone.
ERIC	The body is perfect. And if we harvest a head tonight, she'll be ready by sunrise.
DARYL	When you brought me back, you promised you'd take care of me. I need this, Chris. I need someone.
CHRIS	Please don't ask me to do this. Don't ask me to take a life.
ERIC	I tried to tell him, if you take a life to make a new life, the whole thing's a wash. No harm, no foul.
CHRIS	Maybe you could... you could go out, let people know --
DARYL	No! Can't see me.
CHRIS	Number five, Daryl's gonna drive.
DARYL	Help me, brother.
ERIC	A man of taste.
WILLOW	Well, I've checked the obits. Nothing that would make for a likely candidate.
XANDER	They're kinda picky for guys who had three heads to begin with.
WILLOW	Formaldahyde.
XANDER	Come again?
GILES	Yes of course. It accelerates neural decay in the brain cells.
WILLOW	A couple days and they're useless. They're gonna need something really fresh.
BUFFY	How fresh?
WILLOW	As fresh as possible... Buffy, you don't think they'd...
BUFFY	I think anyone who cuts dead girls into pieces does not get the benefit of any doubt. Let's end this thing.
GILES	Seconded.
BUFFY	You two head to Eric's. I'll try Chris's. We can meet back here.
GILES	I'm supposed to be at the, uh, the big game, I believe it's called.
BUFFY	You go ahead. We can handle this.
GILES	Well, I really should --
BUFFY	Okay, we'll meet up there. Report back.
GILES	All right.
WILLOW	Buffy, don't be too hard on Chris. I mean, he's not a vampire...
BUFFY	No. He's just a ghoul.
BUFFY	So... is Chris home?
MOM	Westbury game. November 17, 95. Daryl rushed 185 yards that night - four TDs. He was MVP and made All City that season--
BUFFY	Yea, that was a great one... but is Chris home?
MOM	I don't know... is today a school day? (leans toward screen/intense) Watch - watch this move. Daryl takes the kick off, sheds one - two - three defenders! He breaks into the open field for a 95 yard touch down. He would have been nineteen next week, you know.
BUFFY	Cordelia...
CHEERLEADER	Cordelia, you coming?
CORDELIA	I'll be right out.
BUFFY	Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia?
BUFFY	I'm sorry... where, did you say?
BUFFY	It's okay, you're okay. He's gone.
CORDELIA	Oh, my god, Buffy...!
BUFFY	He's gone. What happened?
CORDELIA	I don't know. I was just about to go to the field when Chris came in, and then somebody just jumped me.
BUFFY	Well, it's okay now. You're fine. Just relax, take your time...
CORDELIA	Oh, my god! That's the fight song. It's time for the cheerleader pyramid at mid-field. I have to go.
BUFFY	You sure you're okay to go out there?
CORDELIA	You don't understand, I have to go. I'm the apex.
BUFFY	I know what you're trying to do, Chris... you and Eric...
CHRIS	I have to do it for him... He needs someone...
BUFFY	Who, Eric? He needs industrial strength therapy.
CHRIS	He always looked out for me... stood up for me... he's all alone... everybody loved him and now he's all alone...
BUFFY	Who are you --
DARYL	He promised me! Promised! I wouldn't have to be alone!
ERIC	It's not too late...
BUFFY	Daryl...? Daryl!
CHRIS	But he would never go out... Unless...
BUFFY	He's gonna pick up where you left off.
CALENDAR	I don't know what it is about football that does it for me. It lacks the grace of basketball and the poetry of baseball. At its best, it's unadorned aggression. It's just such a rugged contest...
GILES	Rugged? American football?
CALENDAR	What's funny about that?
GILES	Well, I do find it odd that a nation that prides itself on its virility feels compelled to strap on forty pounds of protective gear just to play rugby.
CALENDAR	Is this your normal strategy for a first date: dissing my country's national pastime?
GILES	Did you say... "date"?
CALENDAR	You noticed that, huh?
WILLOW	Buffy get back yet?
GILES	No. But perhaps you should circulate down nearer the field to find her.
WILLOW	Eric's was a bust. Nothing there.
XANDER	Yeah, nothing but a lot of computer equipment and a pornography collection so prodigious it even scared me.
BUFFY	I don't see her. Do you?
CORDELIA	Please... what's going on... take off the blindfold, I won't scream, I promise...
ERIC	No! It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
CORDELIA	Please... just take off the blindfold, I promise I won't --
DARYL	Cordelia...
ERIC	You can scream all you want - we're in an abandoned building... (scream continues; he picks up a blunt object) okay, that's enough.
DARYL	You were always good to me. Always noticed me, but I ignored you. I'm sorry. I'm glad that I got this second chance to tell you that.
CORDELIA	D-Daryl...?
DARYL	I was thoughtless, I know that now. But I've changed, I've learned to appreciate how much it meant that you wanted to be with me.
ERIC	We're ready.
CORDELIA	Ready? Ready for what?!
ERIC	You're going to feel a little pinch, maybe a little discomfort around the neck area. But when you wake up, you'll have the body of a seventeen year old. In fact...
BUFFY	He was here. Chris, where did he take her?
CHRIS	To the rest of the body. To the lab.
BUFFY	Where is that?
CHRIS	I promised him...
BUFFY	He'll kill Cordelia. You can't just give and take lives like that. It's not your job.
CHRIS	Please try not to hurt him. He's in the old science building. Everything is set up there.
BUFFY	Okay, find Willow and Xander and Mr. Giles. Tell them what's going on.
CORDELIA	Daryl, please... you don't have to do this.
DARYL	I have to. So we can be together.
CORDELIA	We can be together anyway. I'll be with you. I promise.
DARYL	Is that right? You see anything you like?
CORDELIA	Please...
ERIC	Sterile enough for government work...
CORDELIA	Buffy! Help me!
BUFFY	Daryl, listen, I know who you are. Your brother sent me to stop this.
DARYL	He wouldn't do that. He loves me.
CORDELIA	Buffy, they're crazy!
BUFFY	It's okay, Cordelia, I'm getting you out of here.
DARYL	No, I'm not finished with her.
CORDELIA	Buffy!
DARYL	I won't live alone!
ERIC	Let go!
XANDER	Buffy!
BUFFY	Get Cordelia!
CORDELIA	No!
CALENDAR	Buffy, get out!
CHRIS	Daryl! Don't!
DARYL	No! She's mine!
CHRIS	Daryl!
CHRIS	The first time he woke up, after... he said I shouldn't have brought him back. I was just trying to look out for him. Like he would have done for me.
ANGEL	I saw the fire, figured you'd be here. Is everyone okay?
BUFFY	Yeah. We're okay.
GILES	I am sorry about all this.
CALENDAR	That's okay. Although a good rule of thumb for a first date is don't do anything so exciting that it will be hard to top on the second date.
GILES	Believe it or not, since I've moved here to live on top of the Hellmouth, the events of this evening actually qualify as a slow night. Did you say, "second date"?
CALENDAR	Ah, you noticed that too?
XANDER	Well, I guess that makes it official. Everyone's paired off. Vampires can get dates. Hell, even the school librarian is seeing more action than me. (shakes his head) You ever feel like the world is a giant game of musical chairs, and the music has stopped and you're the only one who doesn't have a chair?
WILLOW	All the time.
CORDELIA	Xander, I, uh, just wanted to say thanks for saving my life in there. It was... really brave and heroic and all. And if there's ever anything I can do to repay you...
XANDER	Do you mind? We're talking here.
WILLOW	Wondering why we never seem to have dates.
XANDER	Oh, yeah. So, why do you think that is?
BUFFY	The whole thing was creepy. But at the same time... I mean, he did do it all for his brother...
ANGEL	Sounds like he took it a little over the edge.
BUFFY	Love makes you do the wacky...
ANGEL	The what?
BUFFY	Crazy stuff.
ANGEL	Oh. Crazy like a 241 year old being jealous of a high school junior?
BUFFY	Are you fessing up?
ANGEL	I thought about it. Maybe he bothers me a little.
BUFFY	I don't love Xander.
ANGEL	But he's in your life. He gets to be there when I can't. Take your classes, eat your meals, hear your jokes and complaints. He gets to see you in the sunlight.
ANGEL	It'll be morning soon. I should probably...
BUFFY	...yeah. I've got things to...
BUFFY	Come on, Stephan, rise and shine. Some of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
ANGEL	Hey--
BUFFY	Ack!
ANGEL	Is this a bad time?
BUFFY	Are you crazy? You don't just sneak up on people in a graveyard. You make noise when you walk. You... stomp, or... yodel.
ANGEL	I heard you were on the hunt.
BUFFY	Supposed to be. But lazybones here doesn't wanna come out and play.
ANGEL	When you first wake up, it's a little disorienting. He'll show.
BUFFY	It's weird to think of you going through that.
ANGEL	It's weird to go through. You're here alone?
BUFFY	Yeah, why?
ANGEL	I just thought you'd have somebody with you... Xander or someone.
BUFFY	Xander?
ANGEL	Or someone.
BUFFY	No, no Xander. Why, are you jealous?
ANGEL	Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.
BUFFY	Is it 'cause I danced with him?
ANGEL	"Danced with" is a pretty loose term. "Mated with" might be a little closer --
BUFFY	Oh, you're shocking! One little dance and you know I just did it to make you crazy which by the way behold my success!
ANGEL	I am not jealous!
BUFFY	Oh, you're not jealous. What, vampires don't get jealous?
ANGEL	See? Whenever we fight, you always bring up the vampire thing.
BUFFY	I didn't come here to fight.
ANGEL	I didn't touch your stake...
GILES	So, what I'm proposing... and I don't mean to appear indecorous... is a social engagement... a date, if you will. If you're amenable... Idiot!
BUFFY	Boy. I guess we just never realized how much you liked that chair.
GILES	Oh, I, uh, I was just working on--
BUFFY	Your pick-up lines?
GILES	In a manner of speaking, yes.
BUFFY	Then, if you don't mind a little Gene and Roger, I would leave off the "idiot" part. Being called an idiot tends to take a person out of the dating mood.
XANDER	Actually, it kind of turns me on.
BUFFY	I fear you. I'd also avoid words like "amenable" and "indecorous." Speak English, not whatever they speak in...
GILES	England?
BUFFY	Yeah. Just say, "Hey, I got a thing, you're maybe feeling a thing, and there could be a thing."
GILES	Well, thank you, Cyrano.
BUFFY	I'm not finished. Then you say, "How do you feel about Mexican?"
GILES	About Mexicans?
BUFFY	Mexican! Food. You take her for food. For which you then pay.
GILES	Right.
XANDER	So, this "chair" woman? We are talking Ms. Calendar, right?
GILES	What makes you think that?
XANDER	Simple deduction: Ms. Calendar is reasonably dollsome, especially for someone in your age bracket; she already knows you're a school librarian, so you don't have to worry about how to break that embarrassing news to her...
BUFFY	And she's the only woman we've ever actually seen speaking to you. Add it all up, it spells "duh."
XANDER	Now, is it time for us to talk about the facts of life?
GILES	I am suddenly deciding that this is none of your business.
XANDER	'Cause that whole stork thing is a smokescreen...
GILES	So, how did things go last night? Did Mr. Korshack show up on schedule?
BUFFY	More or less. Angel and I took care of him.
XANDER	Angel.
BUFFY	There's something else, though. I found an empty grave.
GILES	Another vampire?
BUFFY	No, no. It was dug up, and the body was taken out.
GILES	Grave robbing. Well, that's new. Interesting.
BUFFY	I know that you meant to say "gross and disturbing".
GILES	Yes of course. Terrible thing. Must put a stop to it. Dammit.
XANDER	So why does someone rob graves?
GILES	I'll collate some theories. Might help to know who the body belonged to.
BUFFY	Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?
XANDER	Drawing a blank.
GILES	Well, perhaps Willow can fire up the machine (points at computer) and track Meredith down.
ERIC	Look at those legs...
WILLOW	No thank you.
CHRIS	Eric, knock it off.
WILLOW	Hey, Chris. I was just wondering what you're going to do this year.
CHRIS	Why?
WILLOW	Well, every year, you win and I place second. I just thought I'd see what I'm up against.
CHRIS	You know what the key is? If Dr. Clark doesn't understand your experiment, he gives it higher marks so it looks like he understands your experiment. (reads Willow's clipboard) "Effects of Subviolet Light Spectrum Deprivation on the Development of Fruit Flies." (smiles, friendly) That should do the trick.
CORDELIA	Okay, I'm doing this under protest. It is not fair that they're making participation in the Science Fair mandatory this year. I don't think anyone should have to do anything educational at school if they don't want to.
WILLOW	"The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable?"
CORDELIA	I want something I can finish in a weekend, okay?
ERIC	Come on. The camera loves you.
CORDELIA	I thought yearbook nerds didn't come out of hibernation till the spring.
ERIC	It's for my private collection.
CHRIS	Eric, will you quit it?
BUFFY	Coming through. Hey, Willow, sorry to interrupt, but.. it's the Bat Signal.
WILLOW	Sure, okay. See you, Chris. Thanks for the tip.
ERIC	Cordelia is so fine. You know, she'd be just perfect for us...
CHRIS	Don't be an idiot. She's alive.
CORDELIA	Hi. Sorry to interrupt your little undead play group, but I need to ask Willow if she'll help me with my Science Fair project.
WILLOW	It's a fruit.
CORDELIA	I would ask Chris for help, but... (a little emotional) it would bring back too many memories of Daryl.
WILLOW	I found it...
CORDELIA	Of course, I've learned to deal with my pain...
BUFFY	And how was her neck?
WILLOW	Fine... except for being broken.
CORDELIA	Hello? Can we deal with my pain please?
XANDER	There there.
WILLOW	It says Meredith and two other girls in the car were killed instantly. They were all on the pep squad at Fondren High, on the way to a game.
BUFFY	You know what this means...
XANDER	That Fondren might actually beat Sunnydale in the cross-town body count competition this year?
BUFFY	It means she wasn't killed by vampires. So somebody did dig up her corpse.
CORDELIA	Eeuw. Why is it that every conversation you people have has the word "corpse" in it?
XANDER	So, okay, we got us a body snatcher. What does that mean?
GILES	Here's what I've come up with: demons who eat the flesh of the dead to absorb their souls. Or it could be a voodoo practitioner--
WILLOW	You mean, making a zombie?
GILES	More likely, zombies. For most traditional purposes, a voodoo priest would need more than one.
BUFFY	So we should see if the other girls from this accident are AWOL, too. Might help figure out what this creep has in mind if we know whether he's dealing in volume.
XANDER	So we dig up some graves tonight?
WILLOW	Oh boy, a field trip! Are you gonna call Angel?
BUFFY	I don't think so.
XANDER	Yeah, why bother him?
BUFFY	We've been sort of... never mind. As far as Angel knows, I'm taking the night off. Okay?
XANDER	So, we're all set, then. Say nine-ish, B.Y.O. shovel.
WILLOW	I'll pack some food. Who likes those little powdered donuts?
CORDELIA	Darn, I have Cheerleader practice tonight. Boy, I wish I'd known you were gonna be digging up dead people sooner; I would have cancelled.
XANDER	All right. But if you do run into the army of zombies, could you page us before they eat your flesh?
GILES	Xander, Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
XANDER	I know, but did you see her face?
BUFFY	He was getting all jealous and he wouldn't even admit it.
WILLOW	Jealous of what?
BUFFY	Of Xander.
WILLOW	'Cause you did that sexy dance with him?
BUFFY	Am I ever gonna live that down?
WILLOW	Nope.
BUFFY	Anyway, Angel's being totally irrational.
WILLOW	Love makes you do the wacky.
BUFFY	That's the truth.
XANDER	You know, this might go faster if you fems picked up a shovel, too.
BUFFY	Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned girl. I was raised to believe the men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies. Speaking of the wacky, what was Cordelia's whole riff about painful memories? Who's Daryl?
WILLOW	Daryl Epps. Chris's older brother. He was a big football star. All-State two years ago. A running... someone that runs and catches.
BUFFY	Was he a studly?
WILLOW	Big time. All the girls were crazy for him.
BUFFY	And he broke Cordy's heart? Thus possibly proving its existence...
WILLOW	He died. Rock climbing, or something. He fell.
BUFFY	Oh, man. That's lousy. Poor Chris.
WILLOW	He really looked up to his brother. It was tough. Ever since then he's been... real quiet. Kind of in his own world. And I hear his mother doesn't even leave the house anymore.
WILLOW	By the way, are we hoping to find a body, or no body?
XANDER	Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping to find a fortune in gold dubloons.
BUFFY	Well, "body" could mean flesh eating demon or corpse-mutilating pagan ritual. "No body" points more toward the army of zombies thing. Take your pick.
GILES	Go ahead.
XANDER	You're closer.
BUFFY	Pathetic much?
ANGEL	Cordelia. This is the last place I expected you to hang out.
CORDELIA	Oh, god... oh, god, it's you. Why were you following me?
ANGEL	I wasn't sure it was you at first. I'm looking for Buffy.
CORDELIA	Buffy? Well, she's -- big shock -- at the graveyard.
ANGEL	She said she'd be home.
CORDELIA	Oh, she lied. Isn't she a rascal?
XANDER	So, both coffins empty, that makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.
WILLOW	Is it an army if you just have three?
BUFFY	Well, Zombie drill team then --
ANGEL	Xander.
XANDER	Angel.
ANGEL	I thought you were taking the night off.
BUFFY	I was... going to. But, at the last minute- -
ANGEL	Cordelia told me the truth.
XANDER	That's gotta be a first.
BUFFY	We were investigating... somebody's been stealing the bodies of dead girls.
ANGEL	I know. We found some of them.
BUFFY	You mean like two of the three?
ANGEL	I mean, like some of them. Like parts.
CORDELIA	It was horrible. Angel saved me from an arm.
XANDER	Karma!
WILLOW	Well, so much for the zombie theory.
GILES	So much for all our theories.
BUFFY	I don't get it. Why dig up three bodies, just to chop them up and throw them away again?
ANGEL	What I saw didn't add up to three whole girls. I think they kept some parts.
BUFFY	Could this get yuckier?
WILLOW	They probably kept the other parts to eat.
BUFFY	Question answered.
GILES	But why dispose of the remains here at the school?
BUFFY	Maybe whoever did it had other business in the neighborhood. Like, say... classes.
ANGEL	This was no hatchet job. Whoever made those incisions really knew what they were doing.
GILES	Yes, what student here would be that well-versed in physiology?
WILLOW	I can think of maybe five or six guys in the science club.
BUFFY	Why don't you get their locker numbers, and we'll check 'em out.
CORDELIA	No, I want to go home now. I have to bathe and burn my clothes.
XANDER	Everybody wave bye-bye.
CORDELIA	I don't want to go alone. I'm still fragile. (to Angel) Can you take me?
ANGEL	I...
XANDER	How about that? I always pegged him as a "one woman" vampire.
WILLOW	Xander!
GILES	I hope you understand that as a school official, I can not condone this unauthorized search.
BUFFY	Okay, your butt's covered. You want to grab a locker?
GILES	Yes of course.
WILLOW	Nothing but back issues of "Scientific American." Ooh, I haven't read this one.
GILES	Nothing remarkable here...
GILES	Fair to say, Chris is involved.
XANDER	He's into corpses, all right, but we still don't know why.
BUFFY	Yes we do.
ERIC	I GUESS, YOU'D SAY, WHAT CAN MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY. MY GIRL... How's my baby?
CHRIS	She's not your baby.
ERIC	She's not gonna be anyone's baby if we don't finish her soon.
CHRIS	I'm working on it.
ERIC	So am I, friend. So am I.
XANDER	Any sign of our suspects?
BUFFY	Not yet.
XANDER	You mean, when there's so many pre-made ones just lying around? The things we do for love...
BUFFY	Love has nothing to do with this.
XANDER	Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: People don't fall in love with what's right in front of them. People want the dream. What they can't have. The more unattainable, the more attractive.
WILLOW	And for Eric the unattainable would include everyone. That's alive.
BUFFY	Eric's sick enough to do something like this, but what's up with Chris? He seems like a human person.
WILLOW	I don't know. The thing with his brother was really hard on him; He talked a lot about death. Maybe he just wants to get one up on it.
BUFFY	But, it's not... doable, is it? I mean, making someone from scraps? Actually making them live?
WILLOW	If it is, my science project's definitely coming in second this year.
XANDER	And speaking of love...
WILLOW	We were talking about the reanimation of dead tissue.
XANDER	Do I deconstruct your segues? Yeesh.
BUFFY	Hey, Giles
GILES	Oh. Yes. Hello.
BUFFY	Still no sign of our mad doctors.
GILES	What? Oh. Corpses. Evil. Very good.
BUFFY	Okay, Giles, just remember. "I'm feeling a thing, you're feeling a thing." But personalize it.
GILES	Personalize it?
BUFFY	She's a techno-pagan, right? Ask her to bless your laptop or something. Come on, guys.
CALENDAR	Good morning, Rupert.
GILES	Ms. Calendar.
CALENDAR	Please, call me Jennie. "Ms." Calendar is my father.
GILES	You know, uh, Jenny, I don't mean to appear indecorous... no, not indecorous...
CALENDAR	Yeah...?
GILES	Oh, dear... I, uh... that is...
GILES	Well, what I am proposing is...
CALENDAR	Listen, if it's important, why don't you just tell me at the game?
GILES	You're going to the football game?
CALENDAR	You seem surprised.
GILES	I guess I just assumed you spent your evenings downloading incantations... casting bones.
CALENDAR	On game night? Are you nuts? I assume you're going, too.
GILES	Oh, uh, of course.
CALENDAR	So, why don't we just go together? I could pick you up after school, we could get something to eat on the way, if you like. How do you feel about Mexican?
GILES	Okay... tonight, then.
XANDER	Hello... I want to get ahead!
WILLOW	Maybe an electrical current combined with an adrenaline boost...
XANDER	For the love of God, somebody scratch my nose!
BUFFY	Well, it's official. Chris and Eric didn't come to school today.
XANDER	That's not a coincidence.
WILLOW	Maybe they finished their project.
BUFFY	God, what if it worked, what if that poor girl is walking around...
XANDER	Uh, poor girls, technically.
BUFFY	What could she be thinking?
WILLOW	And what are they... going to do with her?
GILES	I don't think we have to worry about that just yet.
BUFFY	And they only had three girls.
WILLOW	So they don't have the whole, uh, package.
XANDER	Heads must be no good. Hrnmmm, they seemed attractive enough to me... obviously I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.
GILES	Based on what the police put together, they're one step away from completing their masterpiece.
WILLOW	One step...
ERIC	If we wait too long, the onset of atrophy in the limbs will be irreversible.
CHRIS	We can turn up the current. That'll buy us a day at least.
ERIC	We'll lose the entire body if we don't attach the head soon!
CHRIS	We have time!
ERIC	We don't! The crash with the girls was lucky. But we can't keep waiting for another lucky accident to just drop a head in our laps. You know what we have to do! Hell, it's just one lousy girl!
CHRIS	I won't do it... I can't I can't... kill anyone.
DARYL	When you brought me back, you promised you'd take care of me. I need this, Chris. I need someone.
CHRIS	Please don't ask me to do this. Don't ask me to take a life.
ERIC	I tried to tell him, if you take a life to make a new life, the whole thing's a wash. No harm, no foul.
CHRIS	Maybe you could... you could go out, let people know --
DARYL	No! Can't see me.
CHRIS	Number five, Daryl's gonna drive.
DARYL	Help me, brother.
ERIC	A man of taste.
WILLOW	Well, I've checked the obits. Nothing that would make for a likely candidate.
XANDER	They're kinda picky for guys who had three heads to begin with.
WILLOW	Formaldahyde.
XANDER	Come again?
GILES	Yes of course. It accelerates neural decay in the brain cells.
WILLOW	A couple days and they're useless. They're gonna need something really fresh.
BUFFY	How fresh?
WILLOW	As fresh as possible... Buffy, you don't think they'd...
BUFFY	I think anyone who cuts dead girls into pieces does not get the benefit of any doubt. Let's end this thing.
GILES	Seconded.
BUFFY	You two head to Eric's. I'll try Chris's. We can meet back here.
GILES	I'm supposed to be at the, uh, the big game, I believe it's called.
BUFFY	You go ahead. We can handle this.
GILES	Well, I really should --
BUFFY	Okay, we'll meet up there. Report back.
GILES	All right.
WILLOW	Buffy, don't be too hard on Chris. I mean, he's not a vampire...
BUFFY	No. He's just a ghoul.
BUFFY	So... is Chris home?
MOM	Westbury game. November 17, 95. Daryl rushed 185 yards that night - four TDs. He was MVP and made All City that season--
BUFFY	Yea, that was a great one... but is Chris home?
MOM	I don't know... is today a school day? (leans toward screen/intense) Watch - watch this move. Daryl takes the kick off, sheds one - two - three defenders! He breaks into the open field for a 95 yard touch down. He would have been nineteen next week, you know.
CHEERLEADER	Cordelia, you coming?
CORDELIA	I'll be right out.
BUFFY	Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia?
BUFFY	It's okay, you're okay. He's gone.
CORDELIA	Oh, my god, Buffy...!
BUFFY	He's gone. What happened?
CORDELIA	I don't know. I was just about to go to the field when Chris came in, and then somebody just jumped me.
CORDELIA	Oh, my god! That's the fight song. It's time for the cheerleader pyramid at mid-field. I have to go.
BUFFY	You sure you're okay to go out there?
CORDELIA	You don't understand, I have to go. I'm the apex.
CHRIS	I have to do it for him... He needs someone...
BUFFY	Who, Eric? He needs industrial strength therapy.
CHRIS	He always looked out for me... stood up for me... he's all alone... everybody loved him and now he's all alone...
BUFFY	Who are you --
DARYL	He promised me! Promised! I wouldn't have to be alone!
ERIC	It's not too late...
CHRIS	But he would never go out... Unless...
BUFFY	He's gonna pick up where you left off.
CALENDAR	I don't know what it is about football that does it for me. It lacks the grace of basketball and the poetry of baseball. At its best, it's unadorned aggression. It's just such a rugged contest...
GILES	Rugged? American football?
CALENDAR	What's funny about that?
GILES	Well, I do find it odd that a nation that prides itself on its virility feels compelled to strap on forty pounds of protective gear just to play rugby.
CALENDAR	Is this your normal strategy for a first date: dissing my country's national pastime?
GILES	Did you say... "date"?
CALENDAR	You noticed that, huh?
WILLOW	Buffy get back yet?
GILES	No. But perhaps you should circulate down nearer the field to find her.
WILLOW	Eric's was a bust. Nothing there.
XANDER	Yeah, nothing but a lot of computer equipment and a pornography collection so prodigious it even scared me.
CORDELIA	Please... what's going on... take off the blindfold, I won't scream, I promise...
CORDELIA	Please... just take off the blindfold, I promise I won't --
DARYL	Cordelia...
DARYL	You were always good to me. Always noticed me, but I ignored you. I'm sorry. I'm glad that I got this second chance to tell you that.
CORDELIA	D-Daryl...?
DARYL	I was thoughtless, I know that now. But I've changed, I've learned to appreciate how much it meant that you wanted to be with me.
ERIC	We're ready.
CORDELIA	Ready? Ready for what?!
ERIC	You're going to feel a little pinch, maybe a little discomfort around the neck area. But when you wake up, you'll have the body of a seventeen year old. In fact...
BUFFY	He was here. Chris, where did he take her?
CHRIS	To the rest of the body. To the lab.
BUFFY	Where is that?
CHRIS	I promised him...
BUFFY	He'll kill Cordelia. You can't just give and take lives like that. It's not your job.
CHRIS	Please try not to hurt him. He's in the old science building. Everything is set up there.
BUFFY	Okay, find Willow and Xander and Mr. Giles. Tell them what's going on.
CORDELIA	Daryl, please... you don't have to do this.
DARYL	I have to. So we can be together.
CORDELIA	We can be together anyway. I'll be with you. I promise.
BUFFY	Daryl, listen, I know who you are. Your brother sent me to stop this.
DARYL	He wouldn't do that. He loves me.
CORDELIA	Buffy, they're crazy!
BUFFY	It's okay, Cordelia, I'm getting you out of here.
DARYL	No, I'm not finished with her.
CORDELIA	Buffy!
DARYL	I won't live alone!
ERIC	Let go!
CHRIS	Daryl!
ANGEL	I saw the fire, figured you'd be here. Is everyone okay?
BUFFY	Yeah. We're okay.
GILES	I am sorry about all this.
CALENDAR	That's okay. Although a good rule of thumb for a first date is don't do anything so exciting that it will be hard to top on the second date.
GILES	Believe it or not, since I've moved here to live on top of the Hellmouth, the events of this evening actually qualify as a slow night. Did you say, "second date"?
CALENDAR	Ah, you noticed that too?
WILLOW	All the time.
CORDELIA	Xander, I, uh, just wanted to say thanks for saving my life in there. It was... really brave and heroic and all. And if there's ever anything I can do to repay you...
XANDER	Do you mind? We're talking here.
WILLOW	Wondering why we never seem to have dates.
XANDER	Oh, yeah. So, why do you think that is?
BUFFY	The whole thing was creepy. But at the same time... I mean, he did do it all for his brother...
ANGEL	Sounds like he took it a little over the edge.
BUFFY	Love makes you do the wacky...
ANGEL	The what?
BUFFY	Crazy stuff.
ANGEL	Oh. Crazy like a 241 year old being jealous of a high school junior?
BUFFY	Are you fessing up?
ANGEL	I thought about it. Maybe he bothers me a little.
BUFFY	I don't love Xander.
ANGEL	But he's in your life. He gets to be there when I can't. Take your classes, eat your meals, hear your jokes and complaints. He gets to see you in the sunlight.
ANGEL	It'll be morning soon. I should probably...
BUFFY	...yeah. I've got things to...

BUFFY	We missed the bed again.
SPIKE	Lucky for the bed.
BUFFY	Is this a new rug?
SPIKE	No. It just looks different when you're under it.
BUFFY	This place is okay for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up.
SPIKE	Yeah?
SPIKE	Well if you want, I can- Are we having a conversation?
BUFFY	What? No. Sort of.
BUFFY	What?
SPIKE	Well isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
BUFFY	That's the plan. Soon as my legs start working again.
SPIKE	You were amazing.
BUFFY	You, uh, got the job done too.
SPIKE	I was just trying to keep up. The things you do... the way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.
BUFFY	I'm not an animal.
SPIKE	Want to see the bite marks?
BUFFY	It's late. I should try to catch Dawn before she goes to bed.
SPIKE	And she's off.
BUFFY	Where's my underwear?
SPIKE	What is this to you? This thing we have.
SPIKE	Do you even like me?
BUFFY	Sometimes.
SPIKE	But you like what I do to you.
BUFFY	Never.
JONATHAN	We're on the lam, moron. Not like we have a choice. If Buffy finds us, she'll hit you So hard she'll knock your skeleton clean out of your body.
ANDREW	This sucks. Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
JONATHAN	Stop whining and get your sissy crap out of the way.
ANDREW	Hey! Quit it!
JONATHAN	Ow! Get off! Stop it! My bone!
WARREN	HEY!
ANDREW	Cool.
JONATHAN	You got the thing?
ANDREW	Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
JONATHAN	All right. Stand back...
JONATHAN	Doma voluntatem, libera cupidinem. Erunipe, ignem excita. JONATHAN Tame the will, release desire. Spring forth, fuel the fire.
JONATHAN	Okay, ow.
WARREN	Gentlemen, the Cerebral Dampener is on-line.
BUFFY	Double meat is double sweet! Enjoy!
TARA	Hey. Sorry I'm late.
BUFFY	Time has no meaning here. Gina, I'm taking a break.
GINA	You already had one. Stealing from the clock is stealing from the register.
BUFFY	Then this'll be quite a heist.
TARA	I have the sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
BUFFY	If you close your eyes and repeatedly smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away. Eventually. I'm hoping. Thanks for coming by.
TARA	Is it bad?
BUFFY	I was hoping you could tell me.
TARA	I knew this would happen. What did Willow do now? Did she hurt anyone?
BUFFY	Wha -- no! Tara, this isn't about Willow.
TARA	I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
BUFFY	No, God, I'm sorry. Willow's fine. She's been doing so much better, she really has. You'd be proud or her.
TARA	Good, that's... Good.
BUFFY	It's, um, Spike. He... He can hurt me.
TARA	Oh my God. His chip stopped working?
BUFFY	No, it still works. Just... not on me. Tara, I need to know about the spell. The one that brought me back. I'd ask Willow, but --
TARA	You think it's you?
BUFFY	I don't know. But I feel... different. There are things, things that I don't... I think maybe I came back wrong.
TARA	Buffy, no, that's n-not -- no. You didn't.
BUFFY	Can you check the spell, see if there's anything that could have... Can you just check? Please?
JONATHAN	Boost the gain.
ANDREW	Which one's the gain?
JONATHAN	Try the one that says "gain".
ANDREW	Oh.
JONATHAN	Right there! That's got it.
ANDREW	I thought I was Mad Dog Two?
JONATHAN	Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
WARREN	Roger that. Beginning preliminary sweep.
WARREN	Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer. I don't want any surprises.
ANDREW	We can really have anyone we want
JONATHAN	It's like... candy.
ANDREW	Juicy, pulsating candy.
JONATHAN	Oh! The one with the neck! Put the whammy on the neck!
ANDREW	No! The redhead! I want the redhead!
WARREN	Target acquired. Initiating contact.
JONATHAN	What, the brunette?
ANDREW	She's kinda cute -- Ouhh! No! The girl in the leather skirt!
JONATHAN	Ahhhhhhh!
KATRINA	Does that line usually work - -
WARREN	Nice to see you again too, Katrina.
KATRINA	Yeah, it's the "seeing you" part that's throwing me here, Warren, 'cause I thought I was pretty clear with the never wanting that to happen again.
WARREN	Never's a long time, baby.
KATRINA	Apparently not long enough.
WARREN	You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
KATRINA	Which thing would that be exactly? The wind-up slut you tinkered together? Or when little miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
KATRINA	No. I did. For lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
WARREN	Don't say that.
KATRINA	What did you expect? To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with cheesy lines and a fancy suit?
WARREN	No, I just thought, you know, we could talk. Maybe work things out.
KATRINA	There's nothing to work out. What you did was sick. Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
WARREN	You sure about that?
KATRINA	God! Yes, I'm sure --
WARREN	I love you, too, baby.
BUFFY	I'm home. Who wants to help scrape the grease off -- oh my God!
XANDER	Nope, just the dancing.
ANYA	We're teaching Dawn perfectly synchronized steps for the wedding reception.
XANDER	Wanna go for a spin?
BUFFY	I'm leaning more towards an ungainly collapse.
BUFFY	Kinda.
XANDER	You've been going at it too hard, Buff. We hardly ever see you, what with slinging the doublemeat and pounding the big evil.
ANYA	You are looking a little pounded. (off Willow's look) Just around the eyes.
WILLOW	We're thinking about heading over to the Bronze. Wanna come and get all unwindy?
XANDER	Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me. Nectar of the Working Man.
BUFFY	I think I'll just hang with Dawn tonight. Cuddle up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and -
DAWN	I'm sleeping over at Janice's
BUFFY	And I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
WILLOW	It's okay, I checked it out. Janice's Mom is picking her up.
BUFFY	Oh.
DAWN	I didn't think you'd care. You're never home, so...
BUFFY	I know, I'm sorry. But I'm here now. All visible and everything. Couldn't you stay with Janice some other night?
DAWN	Her mom's cooking Mexican. She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
BUFFY	Frosty nectar. Now please.
WARREN	Thanks, baby.
KATRINA	My pleasure, Master.
ANDREW	That is so cool.
JONATHAN	I really could've used one of these in high school.
WARREN	Gentlemen. To crime!
JONATHAN	Crime!
ANDREW	Crime tastes funny.
JONATHAN	Wow. I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but ... wow.
ANDREW	Yeah, she's really cute.
WARREN	Cute? Look at her, man! The shape of her lips. The smooth, silky skin. The way her nose crinkles when she laughs -- She's perfect.
JONATHAN	Yeah!
ANDREW	She's totally hot!
KATRINA	So are you, Master.
ANDREW	You think so?
KATRINA	Oh yes, Master.
JONATHAN	Okay, so how do we, you know.
ANDREW	Yeah. I mean, who gets to - -
WARREN	I do.
ANDREW	That's not fair!
JONATHAN	Dude, you didn't call it!
WARREN	I don't have to call it, Sparky. She's mine. But don't worry. You can play with her all you want... after I'm done with her.
WARREN	Mmm... Good. Use your tongue...
KATRINA	Yes, Master.
WARREN	Touch me ...
KATRINA	Yes, Master.
WARREN	I've missed you so much. You never should have left me. Say it.
KATRINA	I never should have left you, Master.
WARREN	Tell me you love me.
KATRINA	I love you, Master.
WARREN	Again.
KATRINA	I love you, Master.
WARREN	Again.
KATRINA	I love you, Master.
WARREN	I love you too, baby. Get on your knees.
KATRINA	Yes, Warren.
WARREN	What did you just say?
KATRINA	I said yes, War --
KATRINA	What did you do to me?!
WARREN	Get the Dampener!
KATRINA	Who the hell are you?
ANDREW	Um, your masters?
KATRINA	My what?!
JONATHAN	Where'd you put it?!
ANDREW	You had it last!
KATRINA	Are you kidding me?!
WARREN	Get the Dampener!
KATRINA	You were gonna share me with these two dorks?!
ANDREW	Call us "Master!"
JONATHAN	Wait --
ANDREW	Aw crap.
JONATHAN	It's out of juice!
KATRINA	Is that what you used on me?! Oh my God! First the skankbot and now this?! What is wrong with you!
WARREN	Ow! I just wanted us to be together!
KATRINA	There is no us, Warren! Get that through your big meaty head! I'm not your girlfriend anymore!
JONATHAN	She's your ex?!
ANDREW	Dude, that is messed up!
KATRINA	Oh, you think? Bunch of little boys, playing at being men. This isn't some fantasy. It's not a game, you freaks. It's rape.
JONATHAN	What?
ANDREW	No, we - -
KATRINA	You're all sick. I'm going to make sure they lock you away for this. Then you can see how you like getting raped.
WARREN	Stop her!
KATRINA	Get off of me!
WARREN	Charge the Cerebral Dampener.
JONATHAN	Warren --
WARREN	Charge the Dampener! Andrew, get her up.
ANDREW	Oh god oh god oh god.
WARREN	Her neck. It...
JONATHAN	No. That's not -- this isn't happening.
WARREN	Okay. I just gotta... let me think. Just - -
JONATHAN	What did you do? What the hell did you do?!
WARREN	We did this. Me and Andrew and you. It's on all of us.
ANDREW	... oh god oh god oh god...
WARREN	SHUT UP!
JONATHAN	How?
WARREN	Maybe a - a spell. Can you teleport it out of here?
JONATHAN	No, she's -- It's too big.
WARREN	Andrew.
ANDREW	What?
WARREN	Is there anything you can summon. Something that can... devour that much?
ANDREW	Maybe a... a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater. But they're hard to control. Unpredictable. It'd go for us, too.
JONATHAN	Well that's it, man. We're screwed.
WARREN	We just have to stay calm.
JONATHAN	Tell that to your girlfriend!
WARREN	Ex girlfriend.
JONATHAN	It doesn't matter! There's a link. You knew her. So there's a link. You think Buffy's not going to be able to put that together? That's what she does. She'll figure it out.
ANDREW	It was an accident. Maybe if we turn ourselves in -
WARREN	No.
JONATHAN	He's right. If we go to the police now --
WARREN	I'm not going to jail.
JONATHAN	We can't hide this! Sooner or later, the Slayer'll find out she's dead.
WARREN	Then maybe it should be sooner.
JONATHAN	Are you insane?
WARREN	Listen to me.
JONATHAN	No - -
WARREN	Listen! We have two problems. The body. And the Slayer. Maybe there's a way to take care of them both... with one big stone.
WILLOW	We're not going to have to do that at the wedding, are we? 'Cause there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
BUFFY	You're still doing okay, right?
WILLOW	Yeah. You know. Some days are harder than the really hard days. It's easier like this, when I'm not alone.
BUFFY	I'm sorry I haven't been around much.
WILLOW	No, that's not -- it's okay. We all know you've been tied up.
BUFFY	What?
WILLOW	With your job. And the slaying -- not like the vamps are going to start staking themselves, huh?
BUFFY	A girl can dream.
XANDER	I see sitting where yet there should be dancing.
ANYA	Come share in the joy of our groove thang.
BUFFY	I'll catch the next Soul Train out.
XANDER	You sure?
BUFFY	Glass all the way empty. More nectar required.
XANDER	Cool. Shimmy on out when you're lubricated.
SPIKE	What would they think of you? If they found out all the things you've done.
BUFFY	Don't.
SPIKE	Stop me.
XANDER	Ouh. I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
WILLOW	The Funky Monkey claims another victim.
XANDER	I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
TARA	There's a monkey problem?
TARA	Yeah, I was just...
WILLOW	No, it's okay. I don't expect you to stop doing magic just because . . . You don't have to hide it. I'm not - I'm -- I'm doing better. No spells for 32 days. I can even go in the magic shop now. As long as someone's with me. At all time.. But it's better now, it really is. You know, if you were checking on me.
TARA	No, I wouldn't -- I was looking for Buffy.
WILLOW	Oh. I haven't seen her since last night. She's not around much these days. We kinda miss her.
TARA	I'm sure she feels the same way. If you see her, could you tell her I need to talk to her? It's important.
WILLOW	Yeah. Of course I will.
TARA	Thanks.
BUFFY	Don't think about the evil bloodsucking fiend... focus on anything but the evil bloodsucking --
BUFFY	Yeah huh?
BUFFY	It's all right. I'm going to get you out of here. Can you walk? Are you hurt -
SPIKE	Ow! Bloody hell, what did you do that for?
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Buffy!
BUFFY	Spike. What's happening?
SPIKE	You tell me.
BUFFY	I don't know. Things are... jumbled.
SPIKE	So you thought you'd just slip away, then? Vampire, remember? I could feel you.
SPIKE	Buffy - -
BUFFY	She's dead. I - I killed her.
SPIKE	We have to go.
BUFFY	What happened?
SPIKE	There's nothing you can do. We have to go before someone sees you.
BUFFY	What did I do...
SPIKE	We have to go! Now!
SPIKE	All right. Listen to me. Buffy. Buffy!
BUFFY	She's dead.
SPIKE	It was an accident.
BUFFY	I killed her.
SPIKE	I'm going to get you home.
BUFFY	No--
SPIKE	I'm going to get you home. And you're going to crawl into your warm comfy bed and stay there. We'll sort this out. Trust me.
WARREN	One stone.
KATRINA	Yeah.
JONATHAN	Some of my best work.
ANDREW	What happens now?
JONATHAN	The night's young. Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
WARREN	We stick to the plan! Buffy thinks she killed Katrina. It's her problem now.
SPIKE	Shh... Don't worry. It'll be our secret...
BUFFY	Hey.
DAWN	What time is it?
BUFFY	Late. I just wanted to... I love you. You know that, right?
DAWN	What's wrong?
BUFFY	I know I haven't been everything I should be... everything Mom was... but I love you. I always will.
DAWN	Why are you talking like this? Buffy?...
BUFFY	There was an accident. In the woods. A girl -- she... she was hurt. I hurt someone.
DAWN	Oh my God. Is she all right?
BUFFY	No.
DAWN	The police --?
BUFFY	I have to do this.
DAWN	But, what -- what's going to happen?
BUFFY	I don't know.
DAWN	They'll take you away, won't they?
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
DAWN	No, you're not. You're never here. You can't even stand to be around me.
BUFFY	No, that's not true.
DAWN	You don't want to be here with me. You didn't want to come back. I know that. You were happier where you were. You want to go away again.
BUFFY	Dawn --
DAWN	Then go! You're not really here anyway.
WILLOW	What's going on?
BUFFY	Nothing. I have to go do something. Look after Dawn for me, okay?
WILLOW	Yeah. Okay.
BUFFY	The right thing. For once.
SPIKE	Sorry, luv. Can't let you do that.
BUFFY	I have to tell them what happened.
SPIKE	Nothing happened.
BUFFY	I killed that girl.
SPIKE	Demons in the woods? Time going wonky? They won't believe you.
BUFFY	I'll show them. I'll take them there and show them what I did.
SPIKE	Show them what?
BUFFY	What did you do?
SPIKE	I took care of it.
BUFFY	What did you do?!
SPIKE	What I had to! I went back and took care of it. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever find her.
SPIKE	Ouh, balls.
SPIKE	There still isn't anything to connect this to you.
BUFFY	It doesn't matter.
SPIKE	It wasn't your fault.
BUFFY	I killed her.
SPIKE	It was an accident. It just happened.
BUFFY	Nothing just happens.
SPIKE	You're not doing this.
BUFFY	Let me go, Spike. Please. Just let me go...
SPIKE	I can't. I love you.
BUFFY	No, you don't.
BUFFY	Try harder.
SPIKE	You're not throwing your life away over this.
BUFFY	It's not your choice.
SPIKE	Why are you doing this to yourself?
BUFFY	A girl is dead because of me.
SPIKE	And how many people are alive because of you? How many have you saved? One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
BUFFY	That's all it is to you, isn't it? Just another body!
SPIKE	Buffy -
BUFFY	You can't understand why this is killing me, can you?!
SPIKE	Why don't you explain it?
BUFFY	I'm not your girl!
SPIKE	You always hurt... the one you love, pet.
SERGEANT	I'm waiting for confirmation now. No, no statements. Not until I get confirmation.
BUFFY	Excuse me. I need to, um...
SERGEANT	I'll be with you in a second.
KATRINA	You're keeping secrets from me... other girls, who knows what else!
WARREN	Shut up, Trina!
BUFFY	Warren.
SERGEANT	Now what's the problem, Miss --
XANDER	According to this, they place the time of Katrina's death almost a full day before you saw her in the woods.
WILLOW	Was she some kind of Zombie?
ANYA	I don't think so. Is this what you saw?
BUFFY	Yeah. That's it.
ANYA	The Rwasundi. Very rare. Their presence in our dimension creates a kind of localized temporal disturbance.
BUFFY	That's why time want all David Lynch?
ANYA	Right. Human perception is based on linear chronology. Being exposed to the Rwasundi for more than a few seconds causes vivid hallucinations. And a slight tingling of the scalp.
WILLOW	So that's it. These things just made you think you killed her.
XANDER	She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
BUFFY	It wasn't the demons. It was Warren. He knew Katrina. He had something to do with this. I know it.
WILLOW	How can you be sure?
BUFFY	Because you always hurt the one you love.
DAWN	Does this mean you're not going away?
BUFFY	Yeah, honey. I'm not going anywhere.
WARREN	We're gonna get away with it. "Injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
JONATHAN	What about Buffy?
WARREN	Wasn't that hard messing her game up. She figures it out, we'll take care of her.
ANDREW	We really got away with murder. That's... kinda cool.
JONATHAN	Yeah. Cool.
TARA	I've double checked everything. There's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY	Then why can Spike hurt me?
TARA	Well, I said there's nothing wrong with you, but you are different. Shifting you out of -- from where you were, funneling your essence back into your body -- it altered you on a basic, molecular level. Probably just enough to confuse the sensors or whatever in Spike's chip. But it's all surfacey physical stuff. It wouldn't have any more effect on you than a bad sunburn.
BUFFY	I didn't come back wrong.
TARA	No. You're the same Buffy. With a deep tropical cellular tan.
BUFFY	You must have missed something. Check again.
TARA	Buffy, I promise there's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY	There has to be!
I	let Spike do those things to me?
TARA	You mean hit you?
BUFFY	He's everything I hate. Everything I'm suppose to be against. But the only time I feel anything is when we... Don't tell anyone. Please.
TARA	I won't.
BUFFY	The way they would look at me... I couldn't.
TARA	I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.
BUFFY	You don't know how hard it is. Lying to everyone you love about who you're sleeping with.
TARA	Sweetie, I'm a fag. I been there.
BUFFY	Why can't I stop? Why do I keep letting him in?
TARA	Do you love him?
BUFFY	Using him? What's okay about that?
BUFFY	It is! It's wrong. I'm wrong... Tell me that I'm wrong...
BUFFY	We missed the bed again.
SPIKE	Lucky for the bed.
BUFFY	Is this a new rug?
SPIKE	No. It just looks different when you're under it.
BUFFY	This place is okay for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up.

KATRINA	You were gonna share me with these two dorks?!
ANDREW	Aw crap.
JONATHAN	It's out of juice!
KATRINA	Is that what you used on me?! Oh my God! First the skankbot and now this?! What is wrong with you!
WARREN	Ow! I just wanted us to be together!
KATRINA	There is no us, Warren! Get that through your big meaty head! I'm not your girlfriend anymore!
JONATHAN	She's your ex?!
ANDREW	Dude, that is messed up!
KATRINA	Oh, you think? Bunch of little boys, playing at being men. This isn't some fantasy. It's not a game, you freaks. It's rape.
JONATHAN	What?
ANDREW	No, we - -
WARREN	Charge the Cerebral Dampener.
JONATHAN	Warren --
WARREN	Charge the Dampener! Andrew, get her up.
WARREN	Her neck. It...
JONATHAN	No. That's not -- this isn't happening.
WARREN	We did this. Me and Andrew and you. It's on all of us.
ANDREW	... oh god oh god oh god...
WARREN	SHUT UP!
JONATHAN	How?
WARREN	Maybe a - a spell. Can you teleport it out of here?
JONATHAN	No, she's -- It's too big.
WARREN	Andrew.
ANDREW	What?
WARREN	Is there anything you can summon. Something that can... devour that much?
ANDREW	Maybe a... a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater. But they're hard to control. Unpredictable. It'd go for us, too.
JONATHAN	Well that's it, man. We're screwed.
WARREN	We just have to stay calm.
JONATHAN	Tell that to your girlfriend!
WARREN	Ex girlfriend.
JONATHAN	It doesn't matter! There's a link. You knew her. So there's a link. You think Buffy's not going to be able to put that together? That's what she does. She'll figure it out.
ANDREW	It was an accident. Maybe if we turn ourselves in -
WARREN	No.
JONATHAN	He's right. If we go to the police now --
WARREN	I'm not going to jail.
JONATHAN	We can't hide this! Sooner or later, the Slayer'll find out she's dead.
WARREN	Then maybe it should be sooner.
JONATHAN	Are you insane?
WARREN	Listen to me.
JONATHAN	No - -
WARREN	Listen! We have two problems. The body. And the Slayer. Maybe there's a way to take care of them both... with one big stone.
WILLOW	We're not going to have to do that at the wedding, are we? 'Cause there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
BUFFY	You're still doing okay, right?
WILLOW	Yeah. You know. Some days are harder than the really hard days. It's easier like this, when I'm not alone.
BUFFY	I'm sorry I haven't been around much.
WILLOW	No, that's not -- it's okay. We all know you've been tied up.
BUFFY	What?
WILLOW	With your job. And the slaying -- not like the vamps are going to start staking themselves, huh?
BUFFY	A girl can dream.
XANDER	I see sitting where yet there should be dancing.
ANYA	Come share in the joy of our groove thang.
BUFFY	I'll catch the next Soul Train out.
XANDER	You sure?
BUFFY	Glass all the way empty. More nectar required.
XANDER	Cool. Shimmy on out when you're lubricated.
BUFFY	Don't.
SPIKE	Stop me.
XANDER	Ouh. I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
WILLOW	The Funky Monkey claims another victim.
XANDER	I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
TARA	There's a monkey problem?
TARA	Yeah, I was just...
WILLOW	No, it's okay. I don't expect you to stop doing magic just because . . . You don't have to hide it. I'm not - I'm -- I'm doing better. No spells for 32 days. I can even go in the magic shop now. As long as someone's with me. At all time.. But it's better now, it really is. You know, if you were checking on me.
TARA	No, I wouldn't -- I was looking for Buffy.
WILLOW	Oh. I haven't seen her since last night. She's not around much these days. We kinda miss her.
TARA	I'm sure she feels the same way. If you see her, could you tell her I need to talk to her? It's important.
WILLOW	Yeah. Of course I will.
TARA	Thanks.
SPIKE	Ow! Bloody hell, what did you do that for?
BUFFY	Spike?
BUFFY	Spike. What's happening?
SPIKE	You tell me.
BUFFY	I don't know. Things are... jumbled.
SPIKE	So you thought you'd just slip away, then? Vampire, remember? I could feel you.
SPIKE	We have to go.
BUFFY	What happened?
SPIKE	There's nothing you can do. We have to go before someone sees you.
BUFFY	What did I do...
BUFFY	She's dead.
SPIKE	It was an accident.
BUFFY	I killed her.
SPIKE	I'm going to get you home.
BUFFY	No--
SPIKE	I'm going to get you home. And you're going to crawl into your warm comfy bed and stay there. We'll sort this out. Trust me.
KATRINA	Yeah.
JONATHAN	Some of my best work.
ANDREW	What happens now?
JONATHAN	The night's young. Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
WARREN	We stick to the plan! Buffy thinks she killed Katrina. It's her problem now.
BUFFY	Hey.
DAWN	What time is it?
BUFFY	Late. I just wanted to... I love you. You know that, right?
DAWN	What's wrong?
BUFFY	I know I haven't been everything I should be... everything Mom was... but I love you. I always will.
DAWN	Why are you talking like this? Buffy?...
BUFFY	There was an accident. In the woods. A girl -- she... she was hurt. I hurt someone.
DAWN	Oh my God. Is she all right?
BUFFY	No.
DAWN	The police --?
BUFFY	I have to do this.
DAWN	But, what -- what's going to happen?
BUFFY	I don't know.
DAWN	They'll take you away, won't they?
BUFFY	I'm sorry.
DAWN	No, you're not. You're never here. You can't even stand to be around me.
BUFFY	No, that's not true.
DAWN	You don't want to be here with me. You didn't want to come back. I know that. You were happier where you were. You want to go away again.
BUFFY	Dawn --
DAWN	Then go! You're not really here anyway.
WILLOW	What's going on?
BUFFY	Nothing. I have to go do something. Look after Dawn for me, okay?
WILLOW	Yeah. Okay.
SPIKE	Sorry, luv. Can't let you do that.
BUFFY	I have to tell them what happened.
SPIKE	Nothing happened.
BUFFY	I killed that girl.
SPIKE	Demons in the woods? Time going wonky? They won't believe you.
BUFFY	I'll show them. I'll take them there and show them what I did.
SPIKE	Show them what?
BUFFY	What did you do?
SPIKE	I took care of it.
BUFFY	What did you do?!
SPIKE	What I had to! I went back and took care of it. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever find her.
SPIKE	Ouh, balls.
SPIKE	There still isn't anything to connect this to you.
BUFFY	It doesn't matter.
SPIKE	It wasn't your fault.
BUFFY	I killed her.
SPIKE	It was an accident. It just happened.
BUFFY	Nothing just happens.
SPIKE	You're not doing this.
BUFFY	Let me go, Spike. Please. Just let me go...
SPIKE	I can't. I love you.
BUFFY	No, you don't.
SPIKE	You're not throwing your life away over this.
BUFFY	It's not your choice.
SPIKE	Why are you doing this to yourself?
BUFFY	A girl is dead because of me.
SPIKE	And how many people are alive because of you? How many have you saved? One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
BUFFY	That's all it is to you, isn't it? Just another body!
SPIKE	Buffy -
BUFFY	You can't understand why this is killing me, can you?!
SPIKE	Why don't you explain it?
BUFFY	I'm not your girl!
SERGEANT	I'm waiting for confirmation now. No, no statements. Not until I get confirmation.
BUFFY	Excuse me. I need to, um...
KATRINA	You're keeping secrets from me... other girls, who knows what else!
WARREN	Shut up, Trina!
XANDER	According to this, they place the time of Katrina's death almost a full day before you saw her in the woods.
WILLOW	Was she some kind of Zombie?
BUFFY	Yeah. That's it.
ANYA	The Rwasundi. Very rare. Their presence in our dimension creates a kind of localized temporal disturbance.
BUFFY	That's why time want all David Lynch?
ANYA	Right. Human perception is based on linear chronology. Being exposed to the Rwasundi for more than a few seconds causes vivid hallucinations. And a slight tingling of the scalp.
WILLOW	So that's it. These things just made you think you killed her.
XANDER	She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
BUFFY	It wasn't the demons. It was Warren. He knew Katrina. He had something to do with this. I know it.
WILLOW	How can you be sure?
BUFFY	Because you always hurt the one you love.
DAWN	Does this mean you're not going away?
BUFFY	Yeah, honey. I'm not going anywhere.
WARREN	We're gonna get away with it. "Injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
JONATHAN	What about Buffy?
WARREN	Wasn't that hard messing her game up. She figures it out, we'll take care of her.
ANDREW	We really got away with murder. That's... kinda cool.
JONATHAN	Yeah. Cool.
TARA	I've double checked everything. There's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY	Then why can Spike hurt me?
TARA	Well, I said there's nothing wrong with you, but you are different. Shifting you out of -- from where you were, funneling your essence back into your body -- it altered you on a basic, molecular level. Probably just enough to confuse the sensors or whatever in Spike's chip. But it's all surfacey physical stuff. It wouldn't have any more effect on you than a bad sunburn.
BUFFY	I didn't come back wrong.
TARA	No. You're the same Buffy. With a deep tropical cellular tan.
BUFFY	You must have missed something. Check again.
TARA	Buffy, I promise there's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY	There has to be!
I	let Spike do those things to me?
TARA	You mean hit you?
BUFFY	He's everything I hate. Everything I'm suppose to be against. But the only time I feel anything is when we... Don't tell anyone. Please.
TARA	I won't.
BUFFY	The way they would look at me... I couldn't.
TARA	I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.
BUFFY	You don't know how hard it is. Lying to everyone you love about who you're sleeping with.
TARA	Sweetie, I'm a fag. I been there.
BUFFY	Why can't I stop? Why do I keep letting him in?
TARA	Do you love him?
BUFFY	Using him? What's okay about that?
BUFFY	It is! It's wrong. I'm wrong... Tell me that I'm wrong...

BUFFY	I'm really sorry.
DAWN	It's okay.
BUFFY	No, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner. Someday. I hate having to run out in the middle, it's just this thing out there.
DAWN	I understand.
BUFFY	Spike says it's pretty scary, some kind of monster thing, definitely non-vampire.
DAWN	Well, maybe when you get back, we can set up for your party tomorrow.
BUFFY	Yeah, this might be a while, you shouldn't wait up. Besides, Willow promised she's on birthday patrol. Nothin' left for us to do.
DAWN	Right.
BUFFY	Okay, so homework, finish dinner, and don't stay up too late, all right?
DAWN	Okay.
BUFFY	Good. We'll spend time later, I promise.
BUFFY	Hey, I was using that!
ANYA	Do you think we should set up lots of candles at Buffy's party tomorrow?
XANDER	Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
ANYA	I don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
XANDER	Honey? Slugs get turned off by slug. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
WILLOW	Slugs?
XANDER	The party. Or, Tara. At the party.
WILLOW	Oh.
XANDER	It's just, Buffy really wants her there, seems important to her, and I told her I would ask you.
WILLOW	Oh, yeah, of course, she should totally be there, it'll be great!
XANDER	You'll be okay with it?
WILLOW	What, me? Of course, why wouldn't I be? It'll be fun, I'll be fine.
ANYA	This isn't some weird definition of "fine" that means hiding in your room and crying?
WILLOW	No.
ANYA	Because we're tired of the crying.
WILLOW	Guys, Tara's Buffy's friend, too, she should be there. I want her there, it'll be good to see her.
DAWN	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey, Dawnie. Buffy out patrolling already?
XANDER	Anything new about Warren and the Nerd Herd?
DAWN	No. Just a big Monster Hunt.
XANDER	Man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding. Upside of spending all that time shoved inside a locker. Not that I would know.
DAWN	So, I was thinking, who wants to go with me to the mall for birthday presents?
WILLOW	Oh, honey, I would, but I've got group. You know. The whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing. We're looking for a better name.
DAWN	Oh, well, no, that's good, you should do that. What about you guys?
ANYA	Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
XANDER	I'd go with you, but I've gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew before tomorrow morning.
WILLOW	Sorry. I think it's just one of those nights, you know?
DAWN	Yeah.
WILLOW	You okay going on your own?
DAWN	Yeah, somehow I'll manage to pull it off.
DAWN	Buffy?
TEACHER	Dawn?
HALLIE	I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
DAWN	Great.
HALLIE	I've been looking through your file. Your grades have slipped a little.
DAWN	I've got really hard classes this quarter.
HALLIE	Still. Teachers say you've seemed a little distracted lately.
DAWN	I'm not. I'm fine.
HALLIE	Okay. It's just, I know it must seem weird, talking to a stranger about stuff. But I want you to know, if something's going on, if something's up --
DAWN	I'm really okay.
HALLIE	I know there's been a lot of loss.
DAWN	Yeah, kind of. I mean, yes, people keep - - people have a tendency to go away. And I miss them. And sometimes I wish I could make them stop. Going away.
BUFFY	Is there a chemical leak in here?
XANDER	Anya's making hors d'oeuvres.
BUFFY	Oh, God.
ANYA	No, they're yummy. A little cheddar cheese, some scallions, crispy rye...
BUFFY	Is there, like, demon meat in there somewhere?
ANYA	No. Whole jar of mayonnaise, but...
BUFFY	Gagggghhh.
XANDER	Who's coming, you invite anyone else?
BUFFY	No. Willow, Tara, you guys.. Oh, I invited Sophie from work.
ANYA	Really. What's Sophie's last name?
BUFFY	Okay, shut up.
XANDER	Don't worry about it. We're all over the new friend thing.
BUFFY	What new friend thing?
ANYA	Oh, we invited someone for you. A guy.
DAWN	For Buffy? Really?
XANDER	It's not a set-up.
ANYA	Right, no. It's just an attractive, single man with whom we hope you'll find much in common.
XANDER	Ahn.
ANYA	And if you happen to forge a romantic relationship leading to babies and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
BUFFY	I'm going to assume this was an act of kindness. That will help me with all the not throttling.
XANDER	Maybe we should start getting this stuff out there, people will be here soon.
BUFFY	Yes. Maybe we should.
DAWN	Oh, when they get here, can we start with opening the presents maybe?
XANDER	Patience, grasshopper.
BUFFY	I promise I'll let you know when it's time, hang out, have some punch.
BUFFY	Hey, you came.
TARA	Of course, sweetie. How're you doing?
BUFFY	Oh, you know. Better. Mostly. Sometimes.
TARA	So... Is Spike coming?
BUFFY	He may be a chip head but he still doesn't play well with others. And I'm definitely not ready to...
TARA	Come out?
BUFFY	Yeah. I'm all stay inny. How about you, are you okay?
TARA	Yeah, the word "gulp" comes to mind.
BUFFY	Well, remember, we're all-
WILLOW	Hey.
TARA	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey. How are you?
TARA	Fine. Thanks, I'm fine. How are you?
WILLOW	Great. I mean, fine. You know. All Finey McFine Fine.
TARA	You look --
WILLOW	Thanks!
TARA	-- great.
WILLOW	Thanks. You too Is that a new --
TARA	Yeah.
WILLOW	It's nice.
TARA	Thanks.
WILLOW	Great! Good! You should, don't wanna get, you know. Thirsty.
BUFFY	Hey, how did - -
TARA	Yes, please.
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Yeah, Willow mentioned the shindig, figured we're all part of the team, thought I'd swing by.
BUFFY	Wait, what kind of team is this?
CLEM	Hi. We met once before.
BUFFY	Yes. Yes, we did.
SPIKE	You know. More. Merrier. That whole thing.
CLEM	Hi, I'm Clement. Clem.
TARA	Tara.
XANDER	Buffy, Richard.
BUFFY	Hey.
XANDER	Richard was wondering where's the best place to park his car.
BUFFY	Oh? well, it's easy, you just --
XANDER	Buffy'll show you.
BUFFY	Okay. Be right back.
RICHARD	Uh, that guy. With the...?
BUFFY	Skin condition. Doesn't really talk about it.
SPIKE	Stupid git.
TARA	I don't know. He seemed cute. Was he cute? I mean, I'm not a great judge, but I think he seemed cute.
CLEM	I think he seemed cute.
DAWN	If we go get Buffy now, she can start on the presents. It's been enough time, hasn't it?
ANYA	Not yet, sweetie.
XANDER	I think Buff's busy right now anyway.
ANYA	Buffy's making a new friend right now. A grown-up friend.
DAWN	What? You mean that guy you invited to set her up with?
ANYA	Nothing.
DAWN	It's not like I don't understand why you invited him. I was there, remember? I hear you when I'm in the room, you know. I do understand these things.
ANYA	Yes you do.
DAWN	You know I'm in high school, right?
ANYA	Yes you are.
SPIKE	Wanna slip away for a minute, love? I'll let you blow out my candles.
BUFFY	Now? Here? Where? I don't think so.
SPIKE	Why, worried about Richard? Don't wanna make the new boyfriend jealous, eh?
BUFFY	Shut up, he's sweet.
SPIKE	Shut up, he's sweet.
BUFFY	Maybe he's not the jealous one.
SPIKE	Right! 'Cause it's the floppy hair I find so intimidating.
BUFFY	Uh...
WILLOW	See? It's a battery-operated back massager, only it's portable, so you can take it with you on patrol.
BUFFY	Uh huh.
WILLOW	It's like instant gratification for all your little acheys.
BUFFY	Okay! Great, thanks, what's next?
DAWN	Here, do mine.
BUFFY	Dawn...
DAWN	Do you like it?
BUFFY	It's gorgeous.
DAWN	I was so nervous. I was afraid you wouldn't like it.
BUFFY	It's still got a security tag.
DAWN	Huh? That's so weird, I can't believe they left that on.
BUFFY	Oh my God.
ANYA	Yes. Xander did the building, I offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
XANDER	Holds basic weapons, maybe a few non- basic ones. And there's a CD rack.
ANYA	He wanted you to have something no one else would have.
BUFFY	A Xander Harris Original. It's beautiful, thank you.
TARA	Buffy?
BUFFY	Sophie, hey, we're somewhere between presents and cake. There... is going to be cake eventually, right?
SOPHIE	Hey, um, my mom told me to say thank you right away for inviting me, 'cause otherwise I usually forget, so thank you, and also that I can't have any chocolate or peanuts or egg yolks or sometimes dairy.
BUFFY	No problem.
ANYA	That's your friend from work?
BUFFY	Well... yeah. All the good ones got picked off by that lady with the wig, lay off.
ANYA	Humm. Our friend is better.
BUFFY	Dawnie, you mind getting the door? We can do official introductions now that everyone's officially here.
HALFREK	Wish granted.
RICHARD	Great party. Everyone's having fun.
BUFFY	I hope so.
RICHARD	Well, look at the clock. And no one's even thinking about leaving. I know I can't tear myself away.
BUFFY	Yeah.
RICHARD	Hey, can I get you a drink?
BUFFY	No, thanks, I'm -- I'm good. I'm gonna head back in.
RICHARD	I'll look for you.
SPIKE	Ohhh, Buffy, might I get you a soda pop? I think I'm in looooove!
BUFFY	Seriously, stop it, someone will see.
SPIKE	Mmmm-hmmm.
TARA	Muscle cramp. In your pants.
SPIKE	What. It's a thing.
TARA	Right.
ANYA	No, you go.
XANDER	No, you go.
ANYA	No, you go.
WILLOW	Okay, it's just a beer run. I'll go.
SOPHIE	I can't really, like, drink beer, 'cause, you know. Barley. But I'll go with you to get some.
WILLOW	Perfect. Here we go with the beer- getting.
BUFFY	This sucks. I'm out.
RICHARD	No way. I think you're doing fine.
XANDER	Wanna try poker?
CLEM	Still say it's weird without kittens.
BUFFY	No kittens! He's quirky.
RICHARD	We've been playing for, like, three hours. It's already two something. You can't bail now.
ANYA	Yes, Buffy, stay. I want to bankrupt someone.
DAWN	Oh, we should totally have a slumber party!
BUFFY	Well... I don't know. I guess, as long as we're all staying up anyway.
SPIKE	Must be some late-night activities to keep us busy till morning.
SPIKE	What? Oh. Yeah...
TARA	Maybe you should put some ice on it.
RICHARD	Xander, we have to be at work in a few minutes
XANDER	Okay.
WILLOW	Wait, does everyone know who they are? Just figure it's a good idea to check.
RICHARD	I can't be late today.
SPIKE	You should definitely go, let's find your coat, get you on your merry way.
BUFFY	Spike.
RICHARD	I don't know why I'm not going.
SPIKE	Me either. 'Sides, Richie, can't skip breakfast, growing boy like you. Me, I used to love breakfast. (glaring at Richard) In the old days, I probably would have eaten by now.
BUFFY	'Course, with that new diet of yours, you wanna be careful about what you try to put in your mouth now. Spikey.
SPIKE	Yeah? Dunno, tummy's makin' all kinds of gurglies, maybe I oughta just feed on whatever's around, even if it doesn't go down well. You work out?
BUFFY	Okey-dokey.
BUFFY	Hey! Passive Aggressive Guy! Seriously, wanna take it down a notch or two out there?
SPIKE	What, poor, dainty Richard can't take a joke?
BUFFY	We do not joke about eating people in this house!
SPIKE	What are you gonna do? Beat me up again?
WILLOW	Oh. Hi.
TARA	Hey. Breakfast. Didn't plan for a sleep over.
WILLOW	No, me either. I mean, it's weird. I have class, I know I should go.
TARA	I know, it's like I wanna leave, but I don't want to.
WILLOW	Exactly!
TARA	We should probably get back in there.
WILLOW	Yeah, see if anyone else...
TARA	Right. Right.
BUFFY	I should have thrown you out the second you got here. I was insane to think you could ever just hang out with my friends.
SPIKE	And I was insane to think - - oh, wait. You were right, you're insane.
BUFFY	You know what? I think it's time for you to go.
SPIKE	Yeah, well, can't. Daylight.
BUFFY	Then I'll go.
SPIKE	I'll get the door!
BUFFY	Fine!
SPIKE	Fine!
BUFFY	I'm actually trying to move now.
SPIKE	Me too.
BUFFY	Well. This can't be good.
BUFFY	There's something keeping us in this house.
XANDER	Or someone.
TARA	Has everyone tried to get out?
WILLOW	What if we just, like, as a group, get up right now and throw ourselves at the door?
XANDER	All right, count of three. One. Two. Three.
BUFFY	And, hence, the dilemma.
RICHARD	I really need to go. I mean, I have a job to get to.
ANYA	I need to open the shop.
SOPHIE	I have a shift at Doublemeat. Actually, I'm okay here.
CLEM	I'm fine.
XANDER	Tara and Willow have class, I have to get to the site.
BUFFY	I know, I know, we all have places we'd rather be.
SPIKE	Things we'd rather be doing.
BUFFY	So the first priority has to be finding a way out of here.
DAWN	Sure. Of course you all wanna leave. 'Cause being stuck in here with me, that would really suck, right?
DAWN	Yeah, I know. Important. Whatever that means, right?
BUFFY	Dawn?
DAWN	What.
BUFFY	Did you do something?
DAWN	Me??
TARA	Do you know something? 'Cause we want you to feel like you can tell us.
DAWN	What would I know?
WILLOW	We're not accusing you of anything. Just seems like you were taking it kinda personal down there.
DAWN	Oh, okay, so you've all just decided that somehow I'm responsible. Great, here's me basking in the love.
XANDER	It's just, you know, you're upset 'cause we wanna leave, and now we can't leave. Only thing missing is a corn field. There... isn't a corn field, is there?
BUFFY	Listen, it's okay, Dawny. We're not gonna be mad - -
DAWN	Yeah, only I didn't do anything.
WILLOW	You're sure?
DAWN	You want me to ask my other self?
BUFFY	We just wanna try to figure out what's going on.
DAWN	Figure it out yourself, I'm done with being talked to like a kid.
XANDER	'Cause you know, sometimes you do something that seems like a good idea at the time, like, say, invoke the power of a musical amulet. And then it turns out, you know. Not so much.
DAWN	God! I didn't do anything, but I wish I had! Things need to change around here. Nobody's ever around. To hell with you guys - I'm glad you're trapped! How else can I get anyone to spend time with me?
BUFFY	Dawn, if you want us to-
DAWN	Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
XANDER	She's all confusing. Stay here. Go away...
ANYA	I think she's possessed.
BUFFY	That'd be nice.
XANDER	She's a teenager.
TARA	Phones are all out, we're totally cut off.
BUFFY	She was so angry. I've never seen her like that.
TARA	It happens, we all went through it.
BUFFY	I know, but I can't figure out why she didn't just come to me.
XANDER	Well... you've been a little busy lately.
SPIKE	Hey, I don't wanna keep you from all the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group could meet later? Say when we're not trapped in a house?
TARA	Even if Dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna help us right now. We need another way.
BUFFY	Seems like our best bet is magic, something general, cast a wide net.
XANDER	But Willow...?
TARA	No. I'll do it. It's just, obviously I didn't bring any supplies.
BUFFY	And we don't have any in the house. We got rid of everything.
WILLOW	Actually... not everything.
XANDER	That's great! In a very bad way.
TARA	Just... bring me what you have. But then I'm doing this alone, you need to stay away from it.
ANYA	So we're supposed to just wait.
WILLOW	It won't take long.
RICHARD	What is she doing in there, some kind of voodoo spell or something?
SPIKE	Or something.
RICHARD	You want to tell me what's going on here? We're trapped in a house by some, what, unseen force or something, who knows what they're doing in there, the blonde guy here - -
SPIKE	Spike.
RICHARD	-- whatever, is, let's face it, creepy, and I have to tell you, I don't think that's a skin condition.
SPIKE	Um, right, when you're done being a wanker, we are trying to help you.
TARA	Release.
SPIKE	Nope. Can't.
XANDER	It looks pretty bad.
ANYA	Oh, God.
TARA	Let's get him upstairs. We're gonna have to get him to a doctor soon.
ANYA	Oh, God.
SOPHIE	Oh, no. Oh, no.
BUFFY	Hey. It's gonna be okay. You have to trust me, I promise you we'll be out of here soon, okay?
SOPHIE	Oh God, oh God, oh God...
SPIKE	So, you ever think about, maybe, not celebrating your birthday? Just to try it, I mean?
BUFFY	I'm gonna go check upstairs. You keep an eye on things down here?
CLEM	Sorry.
ANYA	Why is it so warm in here?
XANDER	You're just a little freaked out is all, it'll pass.
ANYA	He's gonna die. He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
XANDER	Ahn.
ANYA	And we're just sitting here. Why are we just sitting here, why aren't we doing something?
XANDER	We are. We will. We've been through worse.
ANYA	Not like this. Not trapped like animals. Seriously, did someone turn on the heat or something, I can't, I can't even breathe...
XANDER	Ahn. Ahn, stop, stop.
ANYA	What?
XANDER	I don't know. Lemme get you some water, we'll cool you down, it'll be a start, all right? Some cold water?
BUFFY	The sword. Grab the sword!
ANYA	Xander...
XANDER	Shhh, it's okay, I'm okay. I'm right here, see? Shhh.
BUFFY	It's getting kind of scary, I know. You okay?
DAWN	Do you care?
BUFFY	Fine. Stay with Spike.
DAWN	It's not like I meant for this to happen.
BUFFY	I never said you did.
DAWN	I didn't want this.
BUFFY	What did you want?
DAWN	Nothing.
BUFFY	Dawn, come on
DAWN	No, you don't know, you have this thing you do, you have all these friends, you have no idea what it's like.
BUFFY	What are you talking about, I don't know what what's --
DAWN	Being alone!
BUFFY	You're not alone.
DAWN	Then why do I feel like this?
TARA	We just haven't thought of the right way out yet, that's all.
SPIKE	Well, we can't just stay put like cattle, waiting for the thing to pop out every time it gets peckish.
TARA	I'd say we should do another spell, but I think we've tried everything.
ANYA	Well, that's not completely true, is it?
WILLOW	I can't.
ANYA	No, see, that's not exactly true, either. Not can't. Won't.
WILLOW	You don't know how much I hate this. I don't even know if there's anything I could do.
ANYA	Yes, and a good way to find out is to sit around not trying. That was sarcasm, by the way.
SPIKE	Look - -
WILLOW	It's dangerous.
ANYA	Well, so is all of us dying.
XANDER	Will. I don't wanna gang up on you, but... I kind of get Anya's point.
WILLOW	No, I can't. If I start, I may not be able to stop.
ANYA	And whose fault is that? If you hadn't gotten so much of it in your system in the first place - -
TARA	Hey !!
ANYA	Fine. If you all aren't willing to get us out of this, I'll do it myself.
BUFFY	I wish you had told me.
DAWN	You haven't really been...
BUFFY	What? I haven't been what?
DAWN	Around.
BUFFY	Dawn, the most important job I have is looking out for you.
DAWN	You sound like my guidance counselor. She give you a handbook or something? How to talk to the troubled teen?
BUFFY	Counselor?
DAWN	It wasn't my idea, I didn't even know we had guidance counselors. She called me out of class like I was a total J.D.
BUFFY	And you'd never met her before?
DAWN	No. Not until yesterday.
BUFFY	And she got you to just start talking about things that bothered you at home.
DAWN	Uh, yeah.
BUFFY	You didn't, by any chance, express any kind of, like, wish or something to her, did you?
DAWN	Um. Maybe just a little.
XANDER	Honey, hey, honey, come on, this isn't the way, just calm down.
ANYA	She knows something! She knows something, we have to find out what.
DAWN	Hey!
XANDER	Anh, if you just stop for a second
ANYA	There has to be a clue in here somewhere.
DAWN	Stop it!
BUFFY	Anya, no, it wasn't her fault.
ANYA	Where is it?
DAWN	No...
ANYA	How could you do this?
ANYA	I work hard at that store, and I helped you, I took care of you, is this how you say thank you?
BUFFY	Anya. Hold on. Just tell her you didn't do this. Tell her it's a mistake.
DAWN	No, Buffy, wait.
BUFFY	Oh.
DAWN	Buffy.
ANYA	How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn? You say you didn't put us here, but look at this stuff, how are we supposed to believe you?
BUFFY	No. She didn't -- it wasn't Dawn. I think it was a guidance counselor. Or someone pretending to be one, She got Dawn to make a wish.
ANYA	Guidance counselor. You made a wish to someone you'd never seen before?
DAWN	Yeah.
ANYA	Did she wear a pendant? With a dark blue stone?
DAWN	And little red flecks.
ANYA	Oh, for crying out loud. Halfrek!!
DAWN	I didn't know.
ANYA	Only a vengeance demon can break her own vengeance spell, nothing else will work. She's the only one who can get us out. Hallie, get your ass down here!!
HALFREK	You rang?
ANYA	I. Hope. You. Die. You. Stupid. Jerkface!
XANDER	Anya!
SPIKE	The sword! Get the bloody sword!
ANYA	Her pendant! Get her pendant!
HALFREK	There will be no touching of the pendant.
ANYA	How could you - - why would you do this?
HALFREK	I told you I was going to take care of some business while I was here in town.
ANYA	Yeah, but... cursing us? Some of them are in the wedding party.
HALFREK	Listen, I go where I'm -- (sees Spike) William?
SPIKE	Hey, wait a minute.
BUFFY	You guys know each other?
HALFREK	No. SPIKE Not really.
TARA	I thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged women.
HALFREK	No, that was just Anya's little raison d'etre. Most of us try to be a bit more well-rounded. Oh, and we actually prefer justice demon. FYI.
ANYA	Hmmm. Well-rounded. Is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
HALFREK	It's not a thing, the children need me.
ANYA	Mmmm-hmmm. Daddy issues.
HALFREK	Sling all the little barbs you like, Anyanka, it doesn't change the fact that this girl was in pain, and you couldn't hear it.
ANYA	It's, uh... it's the curse, Hallie.
HALFREK	Oh, for crying out loud. Fine, the curse is lifted, we can all leave now. Dammit.
WILLOW	Thanks. For before. And for taking all this stuff with you.
TARA	No problem.
WILLOW	Just so you know, I was never gonna use it. I mean, not really. I only kept it like a safety net.
TARA	Having the stuff made it easier not to use the stuff.
WILLOW	Yeah, kind of.
TARA	I get it. I really do. But it's time to work without a net, Will.
RICHARD	You have weird friends.
XANDER	News from the file marked "duh." We're gonna get him to the ER.
ANYA	Then we're gonna talk about payment. And Dawnie? Two words I want you to get used to: punitive damages.
BUFFY	You think it's worn off?
SPIKE	Just one thing to do.
CLEM	Good party!
TARA	God, look at the stars.
XANDER	I just wanna run barefoot in the grass so I can feel the dewdrops between my -- God, look at the stars.
ANYA	Okay, who's shoving?
BUFFY	I'm really sorry.
DAWN	It's okay.
BUFFY	No, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner. Someday. I hate having to run out in the middle, it's just this thing out there.
DAWN	I understand.
BUFFY	Spike says it's pretty scary, some kind of monster thing, definitely non-vampire.
DAWN	Well, maybe when you get back, we can set up for your party tomorrow.
BUFFY	Yeah, this might be a while, you shouldn't wait up. Besides, Willow promised she's on birthday patrol. Nothin' left for us to do.
DAWN	Right.
BUFFY	Okay, so homework, finish dinner, and don't stay up too late, all right?
DAWN	Okay.
BUFFY	Good. We'll spend time later, I promise.
ANYA	Do you think we should set up lots of candles at Buffy's party tomorrow?
XANDER	Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
ANYA	I don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
XANDER	Honey? Slugs get turned off by slug. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
WILLOW	Slugs?
XANDER	The party. Or, Tara. At the party.
WILLOW	Oh.
XANDER	It's just, Buffy really wants her there, seems important to her, and I told her I would ask you.
WILLOW	Oh, yeah, of course, she should totally be there, it'll be great!
XANDER	You'll be okay with it?
WILLOW	What, me? Of course, why wouldn't I be? It'll be fun, I'll be fine.
ANYA	This isn't some weird definition of "fine" that means hiding in your room and crying?
WILLOW	No.
ANYA	Because we're tired of the crying.
WILLOW	Guys, Tara's Buffy's friend, too, she should be there. I want her there, it'll be good to see her.
DAWN	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey, Dawnie. Buffy out patrolling already?
XANDER	Anything new about Warren and the Nerd Herd?
DAWN	No. Just a big Monster Hunt.
XANDER	Man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding. Upside of spending all that time shoved inside a locker. Not that I would know.
DAWN	So, I was thinking, who wants to go with me to the mall for birthday presents?
WILLOW	Oh, honey, I would, but I've got group. You know. The whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing. We're looking for a better name.
DAWN	Oh, well, no, that's good, you should do that. What about you guys?
ANYA	Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
XANDER	I'd go with you, but I've gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew before tomorrow morning.
WILLOW	Sorry. I think it's just one of those nights, you know?
DAWN	Yeah.
WILLOW	You okay going on your own?
DAWN	Yeah, somehow I'll manage to pull it off.
DAWN	Great.
HALLIE	I've been looking through your file. Your grades have slipped a little.
DAWN	I've got really hard classes this quarter.
HALLIE	Still. Teachers say you've seemed a little distracted lately.
DAWN	I'm not. I'm fine.
HALLIE	Okay. It's just, I know it must seem weird, talking to a stranger about stuff. But I want you to know, if something's going on, if something's up --
DAWN	I'm really okay.
HALLIE	I know there's been a lot of loss.
DAWN	Yeah, kind of. I mean, yes, people keep - - people have a tendency to go away. And I miss them. And sometimes I wish I could make them stop. Going away.
BUFFY	Is there a chemical leak in here?
XANDER	Anya's making hors d'oeuvres.
BUFFY	Oh, God.
ANYA	No, they're yummy. A little cheddar cheese, some scallions, crispy rye...
BUFFY	Is there, like, demon meat in there somewhere?
ANYA	No. Whole jar of mayonnaise, but...
BUFFY	Gagggghhh.
XANDER	Who's coming, you invite anyone else?
BUFFY	No. Willow, Tara, you guys.. Oh, I invited Sophie from work.
ANYA	Really. What's Sophie's last name?
BUFFY	Okay, shut up.
XANDER	Don't worry about it. We're all over the new friend thing.
BUFFY	What new friend thing?
ANYA	Oh, we invited someone for you. A guy.
DAWN	For Buffy? Really?
XANDER	It's not a set-up.
ANYA	Right, no. It's just an attractive, single man with whom we hope you'll find much in common.
XANDER	Ahn.
ANYA	And if you happen to forge a romantic relationship leading to babies and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
BUFFY	I'm going to assume this was an act of kindness. That will help me with all the not throttling.
XANDER	Maybe we should start getting this stuff out there, people will be here soon.
BUFFY	Yes. Maybe we should.
DAWN	Oh, when they get here, can we start with opening the presents maybe?
XANDER	Patience, grasshopper.
BUFFY	I promise I'll let you know when it's time, hang out, have some punch.
BUFFY	Hey, you came.
TARA	Of course, sweetie. How're you doing?
BUFFY	Oh, you know. Better. Mostly. Sometimes.
TARA	So... Is Spike coming?
BUFFY	He may be a chip head but he still doesn't play well with others. And I'm definitely not ready to...
TARA	Come out?
BUFFY	Yeah. I'm all stay inny. How about you, are you okay?
TARA	Yeah, the word "gulp" comes to mind.
BUFFY	Well, remember, we're all-
WILLOW	Hey.
TARA	Hey.
WILLOW	Hey. How are you?
TARA	Fine. Thanks, I'm fine. How are you?
WILLOW	Great. I mean, fine. You know. All Finey McFine Fine.
TARA	You look --
WILLOW	Thanks!
TARA	-- great.
WILLOW	Thanks. You too Is that a new --
TARA	Yeah.
WILLOW	It's nice.
TARA	Thanks.
WILLOW	Great! Good! You should, don't wanna get, you know. Thirsty.
BUFFY	Spike?
SPIKE	Yeah, Willow mentioned the shindig, figured we're all part of the team, thought I'd swing by.
BUFFY	Wait, what kind of team is this?
CLEM	Hi. We met once before.
BUFFY	Yes. Yes, we did.
SPIKE	You know. More. Merrier. That whole thing.
CLEM	Hi, I'm Clement. Clem.
TARA	Tara.
XANDER	Buffy, Richard.
BUFFY	Hey.
XANDER	Richard was wondering where's the best place to park his car.
BUFFY	Oh? well, it's easy, you just --
XANDER	Buffy'll show you.
RICHARD	Uh, that guy. With the...?
BUFFY	Skin condition. Doesn't really talk about it.
DAWN	If we go get Buffy now, she can start on the presents. It's been enough time, hasn't it?
ANYA	Not yet, sweetie.
XANDER	I think Buff's busy right now anyway.
ANYA	Buffy's making a new friend right now. A grown-up friend.
DAWN	What? You mean that guy you invited to set her up with?
ANYA	Nothing.
DAWN	You know I'm in high school, right?
ANYA	Yes you are.
SPIKE	Wanna slip away for a minute, love? I'll let you blow out my candles.
BUFFY	Now? Here? Where? I don't think so.
SPIKE	Why, worried about Richard? Don't wanna make the new boyfriend jealous, eh?
BUFFY	Shut up, he's sweet.
SPIKE	Shut up, he's sweet.
BUFFY	Maybe he's not the jealous one.
SPIKE	Right! 'Cause it's the floppy hair I find so intimidating.
BUFFY	Uh...
WILLOW	See? It's a battery-operated back massager, only it's portable, so you can take it with you on patrol.
BUFFY	Uh huh.
WILLOW	It's like instant gratification for all your little acheys.
BUFFY	Okay! Great, thanks, what's next?
DAWN	Here, do mine.
BUFFY	Dawn...
DAWN	Do you like it?
BUFFY	It's gorgeous.
DAWN	I was so nervous. I was afraid you wouldn't like it.
BUFFY	It's still got a security tag.
ANYA	Yes. Xander did the building, I offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
XANDER	Holds basic weapons, maybe a few non- basic ones. And there's a CD rack.
ANYA	He wanted you to have something no one else would have.
BUFFY	Sophie, hey, we're somewhere between presents and cake. There... is going to be cake eventually, right?
SOPHIE	Hey, um, my mom told me to say thank you right away for inviting me, 'cause otherwise I usually forget, so thank you, and also that I can't have any chocolate or peanuts or egg yolks or sometimes dairy.
BUFFY	No problem.
ANYA	That's your friend from work?
BUFFY	Well... yeah. All the good ones got picked off by that lady with the wig, lay off.
ANYA	Humm. Our friend is better.
RICHARD	Great party. Everyone's having fun.
BUFFY	I hope so.
RICHARD	Well, look at the clock. And no one's even thinking about leaving. I know I can't tear myself away.
BUFFY	Yeah.
RICHARD	Hey, can I get you a drink?
BUFFY	No, thanks, I'm -- I'm good. I'm gonna head back in.
RICHARD	I'll look for you.
SPIKE	Ohhh, Buffy, might I get you a soda pop? I think I'm in looooove!
BUFFY	Seriously, stop it, someone will see.
TARA	Muscle cramp. In your pants.
SPIKE	What. It's a thing.
TARA	Right.
ANYA	No, you go.
XANDER	No, you go.
ANYA	No, you go.
WILLOW	Okay, it's just a beer run. I'll go.
SOPHIE	I can't really, like, drink beer, 'cause, you know. Barley. But I'll go with you to get some.
WILLOW	Perfect. Here we go with the beer- getting.
BUFFY	This sucks. I'm out.
RICHARD	No way. I think you're doing fine.
XANDER	Wanna try poker?
CLEM	Still say it's weird without kittens.
BUFFY	No kittens! He's quirky.
RICHARD	We've been playing for, like, three hours. It's already two something. You can't bail now.
ANYA	Yes, Buffy, stay. I want to bankrupt someone.
DAWN	Oh, we should totally have a slumber party!
BUFFY	Well... I don't know. I guess, as long as we're all staying up anyway.
SPIKE	Must be some late-night activities to keep us busy till morning.
SPIKE	What? Oh. Yeah...
TARA	Maybe you should put some ice on it.
RICHARD	Xander, we have to be at work in a few minutes
XANDER	Okay.
WILLOW	Wait, does everyone know who they are? Just figure it's a good idea to check.
RICHARD	I can't be late today.
SPIKE	You should definitely go, let's find your coat, get you on your merry way.
BUFFY	Spike.
RICHARD	I don't know why I'm not going.
SPIKE	Me either. 'Sides, Richie, can't skip breakfast, growing boy like you. Me, I used to love breakfast. (glaring at Richard) In the old days, I probably would have eaten by now.
BUFFY	'Course, with that new diet of yours, you wanna be careful about what you try to put in your mouth now. Spikey.
SPIKE	Yeah? Dunno, tummy's makin' all kinds of gurglies, maybe I oughta just feed on whatever's around, even if it doesn't go down well. You work out?
BUFFY	Okey-dokey.
BUFFY	Hey! Passive Aggressive Guy! Seriously, wanna take it down a notch or two out there?
SPIKE	What, poor, dainty Richard can't take a joke?
BUFFY	We do not joke about eating people in this house!
SPIKE	What are you gonna do? Beat me up again?
WILLOW	Oh. Hi.
TARA	Hey. Breakfast. Didn't plan for a sleep over.
WILLOW	No, me either. I mean, it's weird. I have class, I know I should go.
TARA	I know, it's like I wanna leave, but I don't want to.
WILLOW	Exactly!
TARA	We should probably get back in there.
WILLOW	Yeah, see if anyone else...
TARA	Right. Right.
BUFFY	I should have thrown you out the second you got here. I was insane to think you could ever just hang out with my friends.
SPIKE	And I was insane to think - - oh, wait. You were right, you're insane.
BUFFY	You know what? I think it's time for you to go.
SPIKE	Yeah, well, can't. Daylight.
BUFFY	Then I'll go.
SPIKE	I'll get the door!
BUFFY	Fine!
SPIKE	Fine!
BUFFY	I'm actually trying to move now.
SPIKE	Me too.
BUFFY	There's something keeping us in this house.
XANDER	Or someone.
TARA	Has everyone tried to get out?
WILLOW	What if we just, like, as a group, get up right now and throw ourselves at the door?
XANDER	All right, count of three. One. Two. Three.
BUFFY	And, hence, the dilemma.
RICHARD	I really need to go. I mean, I have a job to get to.
ANYA	I need to open the shop.
SOPHIE	I have a shift at Doublemeat. Actually, I'm okay here.
CLEM	I'm fine.
XANDER	Tara and Willow have class, I have to get to the site.
BUFFY	I know, I know, we all have places we'd rather be.
BUFFY	So the first priority has to be finding a way out of here.
DAWN	Sure. Of course you all wanna leave. 'Cause being stuck in here with me, that would really suck, right?
DAWN	Yeah, I know. Important. Whatever that means, right?
BUFFY	Dawn?
DAWN	What.
BUFFY	Did you do something?
DAWN	Me??
TARA	Do you know something? 'Cause we want you to feel like you can tell us.
DAWN	What would I know?
WILLOW	We're not accusing you of anything. Just seems like you were taking it kinda personal down there.
DAWN	Oh, okay, so you've all just decided that somehow I'm responsible. Great, here's me basking in the love.
XANDER	It's just, you know, you're upset 'cause we wanna leave, and now we can't leave. Only thing missing is a corn field. There... isn't a corn field, is there?
BUFFY	Listen, it's okay, Dawny. We're not gonna be mad - -
DAWN	Yeah, only I didn't do anything.
WILLOW	You're sure?
DAWN	You want me to ask my other self?
BUFFY	We just wanna try to figure out what's going on.
DAWN	Figure it out yourself, I'm done with being talked to like a kid.
DAWN	God! I didn't do anything, but I wish I had! Things need to change around here. Nobody's ever around. To hell with you guys - I'm glad you're trapped! How else can I get anyone to spend time with me?
BUFFY	Dawn, if you want us to-
DAWN	Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
ANYA	I think she's possessed.
BUFFY	That'd be nice.
XANDER	She's a teenager.
TARA	Phones are all out, we're totally cut off.
BUFFY	She was so angry. I've never seen her like that.
TARA	It happens, we all went through it.
BUFFY	I know, but I can't figure out why she didn't just come to me.
XANDER	Well... you've been a little busy lately.
SPIKE	Hey, I don't wanna keep you from all the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group could meet later? Say when we're not trapped in a house?
TARA	Even if Dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna help us right now. We need another way.
BUFFY	Seems like our best bet is magic, something general, cast a wide net.
XANDER	But Willow...?
TARA	No. I'll do it. It's just, obviously I didn't bring any supplies.
BUFFY	And we don't have any in the house. We got rid of everything.
WILLOW	Actually... not everything.
XANDER	That's great! In a very bad way.
TARA	Just... bring me what you have. But then I'm doing this alone, you need to stay away from it.
ANYA	So we're supposed to just wait.
WILLOW	It won't take long.
RICHARD	What is she doing in there, some kind of voodoo spell or something?
SPIKE	Or something.
RICHARD	You want to tell me what's going on here? We're trapped in a house by some, what, unseen force or something, who knows what they're doing in there, the blonde guy here - -
SPIKE	Spike.
RICHARD	-- whatever, is, let's face it, creepy, and I have to tell you, I don't think that's a skin condition.
SPIKE	Um, right, when you're done being a wanker, we are trying to help you.
XANDER	It looks pretty bad.
ANYA	Oh, God.
TARA	Let's get him upstairs. We're gonna have to get him to a doctor soon.
SOPHIE	Oh God, oh God, oh God...
SPIKE	So, you ever think about, maybe, not celebrating your birthday? Just to try it, I mean?
BUFFY	I'm gonna go check upstairs. You keep an eye on things down here?
ANYA	Why is it so warm in here?
XANDER	You're just a little freaked out is all, it'll pass.
ANYA	He's gonna die. He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
XANDER	Ahn.
ANYA	And we're just sitting here. Why are we just sitting here, why aren't we doing something?
XANDER	We are. We will. We've been through worse.
ANYA	Not like this. Not trapped like animals. Seriously, did someone turn on the heat or something, I can't, I can't even breathe...
ANYA	What?
DAWN	It's not like I meant for this to happen.
BUFFY	I never said you did.
DAWN	I didn't want this.
BUFFY	What did you want?
DAWN	Nothing.
BUFFY	Dawn, come on
DAWN	No, you don't know, you have this thing you do, you have all these friends, you have no idea what it's like.
BUFFY	What are you talking about, I don't know what what's --
BUFFY	You're not alone.
DAWN	Then why do I feel like this?
TARA	We just haven't thought of the right way out yet, that's all.
SPIKE	Well, we can't just stay put like cattle, waiting for the thing to pop out every time it gets peckish.
TARA	I'd say we should do another spell, but I think we've tried everything.
ANYA	Well, that's not completely true, is it?
WILLOW	I can't.
ANYA	No, see, that's not exactly true, either. Not can't. Won't.
WILLOW	You don't know how much I hate this. I don't even know if there's anything I could do.
ANYA	Yes, and a good way to find out is to sit around not trying. That was sarcasm, by the way.
SPIKE	Look - -
WILLOW	It's dangerous.
ANYA	Well, so is all of us dying.
XANDER	Will. I don't wanna gang up on you, but... I kind of get Anya's point.
WILLOW	No, I can't. If I start, I may not be able to stop.
DAWN	You haven't really been...
BUFFY	What? I haven't been what?
DAWN	Around.
BUFFY	Dawn, the most important job I have is looking out for you.
DAWN	You sound like my guidance counselor. She give you a handbook or something? How to talk to the troubled teen?
BUFFY	Counselor?
DAWN	It wasn't my idea, I didn't even know we had guidance counselors. She called me out of class like I was a total J.D.
BUFFY	And you'd never met her before?
DAWN	No. Not until yesterday.
BUFFY	And she got you to just start talking about things that bothered you at home.
DAWN	Uh, yeah.
BUFFY	You didn't, by any chance, express any kind of, like, wish or something to her, did you?
DAWN	Um. Maybe just a little.
XANDER	Honey, hey, honey, come on, this isn't the way, just calm down.
ANYA	She knows something! She knows something, we have to find out what.
XANDER	Anh, if you just stop for a second
ANYA	There has to be a clue in here somewhere.
DAWN	Stop it!
BUFFY	Anya, no, it wasn't her fault.
ANYA	Where is it?
DAWN	No, Buffy, wait.
BUFFY	Oh.
DAWN	Buffy.
ANYA	How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn? You say you didn't put us here, but look at this stuff, how are we supposed to believe you?
BUFFY	No. She didn't -- it wasn't Dawn. I think it was a guidance counselor. Or someone pretending to be one, She got Dawn to make a wish.
ANYA	Guidance counselor. You made a wish to someone you'd never seen before?
DAWN	Yeah.
ANYA	Did she wear a pendant? With a dark blue stone?
DAWN	And little red flecks.
ANYA	Oh, for crying out loud. Halfrek!!
DAWN	I didn't know.
ANYA	Only a vengeance demon can break her own vengeance spell, nothing else will work. She's the only one who can get us out. Hallie, get your ass down here!!
ANYA	How could you - - why would you do this?
HALFREK	I told you I was going to take care of some business while I was here in town.
ANYA	Yeah, but... cursing us? Some of them are in the wedding party.
HALFREK	Listen, I go where I'm -- (sees Spike) William?
SPIKE	Hey, wait a minute.
BUFFY	You guys know each other?
TARA	I thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged women.
HALFREK	No, that was just Anya's little raison d'etre. Most of us try to be a bit more well-rounded. Oh, and we actually prefer justice demon. FYI.
ANYA	Hmmm. Well-rounded. Is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
HALFREK	It's not a thing, the children need me.
ANYA	Mmmm-hmmm. Daddy issues.
HALFREK	Sling all the little barbs you like, Anyanka, it doesn't change the fact that this girl was in pain, and you couldn't hear it.
WILLOW	Thanks. For before. And for taking all this stuff with you.
TARA	No problem.
WILLOW	Just so you know, I was never gonna use it. I mean, not really. I only kept it like a safety net.
TARA	Having the stuff made it easier not to use the stuff.
WILLOW	Yeah, kind of.
RICHARD	You have weird friends.
XANDER	News from the file marked "duh." We're gonna get him to the ER.
ANYA	Then we're gonna talk about payment. And Dawnie? Two words I want you to get used to: punitive damages.
BUFFY	You think it's worn off?
SPIKE	Just one thing to do.
CLEM	Good party!
TARA	God, look at the stars.
XANDER	I just wanna run barefoot in the grass so I can feel the dewdrops between my -- God, look at the stars.
ANYA	Okay, who's shoving?

TODD	You see, Buffy, the thing you gotta learn about the Palace, and this takes awhile, is that job security all boils down to one simple thing:
BUFFY	Controlling the gag reflex?
TODD	Politics.
BUFFY	Bucket.
TODD	Gotcha.
BUFFY	Tall guy, bleached mullet, works day shifts?
TODD	I'm sorry, my bad. I keep forgetting you dropped out of college.
BUFFY	I'm re-applying.
TODD	Good luck with that! Well. Gotta motor. I don't want to be late for night school.
BUFFY	You go to night school?
TODD	I'm working on my MBA. You think I want to spend the rest of my life cleaning grease traps?
BUFFY	What sane person would?
TODD	Don't forget to lock up on your way out. Oh, and the gum under the tables? Be sure to give 'em a good scrape before you go.
BUFFY	Oh, may I?
TODD	See you tomorrow!
BUFFY	Yes, you will. And the night after that. And the night after that. And the night after that ...
BUFFY	"Get the double treat/that's so double sweet/oh it's hard to beat/when the meat meets the ..." Aah! I cannot get that stupid jingle out of my head!
VAMP	Least of your problems now, little girl.
BUFFY	Wait.
VAMP	Whew. What's that smell? Geez Slayer, is that you?
BUFFY	I've been working!
VAMP	Where, in a slaughter house?
BUFFY	D-Doublemeat Palace.
VAMP	Ooh. Know what? Let's just call it a night. If it's all the same to you, and you've been eating that stuff ... I'm not so sure I want to bite you.
BUFFY	You're dead. You smell like it. How do you get to say I'm the one who's ... (genuinely hurt) ... stinky?
VAMP	Really -- it's cool, I'll just catch you next ti ...
BUFFY	Oh, for Pete's sake. Spike?
SPIKE	Ah. It's a fair cop. You caught me, Slayer. However ...
BUFFY	No, Spike.
SPIKE	"No?" What kind of answer is that? Haven't even heard the question, yet.
BUFFY	I don't need to. We both know what you're thinking.
SPIKE	And we both know I'm not the only one thinking it.
BUFFY	No! Not here. I can't.
SPIKE	Why not?
BUFFY	Dawn
SPIKE	So it's the fear of getting caught, then, is it?
BUFFY	Reason number one on a very long list.
SPIKE	Needn't be an obstacle.
BUFFY	C'mon, I mean it ...
SPIKE	I see you're serious. So am I. I want you. You want me. I can't come inside. So?
BUFFY	Oh. Hey. Dawn. Hi.
DAWN	Rough night?
BUFFY	The usual. Brought you dinner.
DAWN	Great, I'm starved. Actually, I'm kinda full. But my metabolism's tummy has been growling. What did you ... oh.
BUFFY	I know, it's not the most original these days, but ... I made 'em myself! I made hundreds of them, actually, and this -- is the best one.
DAWN	Its looks kinda ... squished.
BUFFY	Oh. Yeah. But you know, you know, give it a minute, 'cause these babies really bounce back. Literally.
DAWN	Buffy, it's not like I don't appreciate it. I do. It's just that, I can't eat this stuff another night. I'm sorry.
BUFFY	No, I get it. Okay Um, tomorrow night? I could bring home the Fisherman Nuggets with cheese.
DAWN	I need real food. I need, like ... cereal.
WILLOW	Hey, workin' lady. Rough night?
BUFFY	Why does everyone keep asking me that?
WILLOW	No reason. Just figured you were busy with the slayage, 'cause of the grass stains.
DAWN	Some vamp get rough with you?
BUFFY	He's not getting any gentler.
WILLOW	"He?"
BUFFY	They. Them. Vampires, in the general population sense. Now I gotta wash this ...
WILLOW	Ready for a bold suggestion? Blow it off! Dawny and I are heading out to the Bronze.
DAWN	Do I have your permission and wanna come along? Like how I slipped in the permission request like that?
WILLOW	Very smooth.
BUFFY	Um ... you guys go.
DAWN	Really?
WILLOW	Buffy, you sure? Might do you some good to get away from the Doublemeat lifestyle for a night. See your friends.
DAWN	Who'd love to see you.
BUFFY	Thanks. But I'm sure I've seen enough action for one night. Home by eleven?
DAWN	On the dot.
BUFFY	Have fun.
XANDER	The seating chart's fine. Let's go back to table arrangements.
ANYA	Would you stop wolfing down those chips? One more bag and you'll pop right out of your cummerbund.
XANDER	Yeah! Wedding, one week. Family, friends and demons flying in and a to-do list that's not getting shorter. Don't take away the chips.
ANYA	We cannot seat the Gnarol Demon at table five.
XANDER	Why not? He's single. Table Five's for singles.
ANYA	But your aunt and uncle are at table two. Table two's more prominent. We don't want to insult a Gnarol, trust me.
XANDER	It's our wedding, not his.
ANYA	We don't strip people's flesh from their bones when we feel insulted.
XANDER	Have you met my Aunt Barbara?
ANYA	The one flying in tonight. Did you call the airport?
XANDER	Not my job -- I'm photographer, flower and hotel guy. You have caterer, budget and travel arrangements.
ANYA	We're splitting travel stuff.
DAWN	How's the soon-to-be newlyweds, guys? Nervous?
XANDER	NO!
DAWN	Okay, I'll just be over here then.
WILLOW	Thanks. How are Mr. and Mrs. High- strung?
DAWN	I'm betting they explode.
WILLOW	You know when I was little, I used to spend hours imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like. And now that I see them together I just think ...
DAWN	You're awfully chipper tonight.
WILLOW	Can't hide it.
DAWN	Big wedding coming up. Lots of date possibilities. You and Tara are speaking again ... You want to call her? Invite her over?
WILLOW	No. Still too soon for so bold a maneuver. But -- if I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me.
DAWN	That's progress.
WILLOW	Hence the happy. Ooh.
DAWN	Headed this way?
GUY	Hi. You're Dawn, right? Taylor. We have bio together ...
DAWN	You sit in the back and don't talk much but draw cartoons and sometimes wear these really cool cowboy boots. Not that I noticed.
GUY	Do you ... want to dance?
DAWN	Sure. I could do that.
BUFFY	Oh, garbage!
BUFFY	Wait! Wait up! Guys ...
DAWN	Hey, Buffy Oh, don't forget - today's trash day.
BUFFY	Thanks "Sorry to inform ..."
DAWN	What's that?
BUFFY	Nothing.
DAWN	Huh. Bronze was fun last night In a total home by elevenish way. You should have come.
BUFFY	Maybe next time. Where are you going?
DAWN	School.
BUFFY	Oh. That's good. Uh, don't you want some breakfast first?
DAWN	Already made it. See you this afternoon. Unless you're working? Tonight, then... Or, you know, Tomorrow's cool ...
BUFFY	Bye.
TODD	... And that's where even your best political minds can drop the ball: zeitgeist. You're not taking that pulse of the public, next thing you know, you're LBJ handing the house keys over to Nixon. Heard back from your college yet?
BUFFY	Yeah.
TODD	All right. You know we're outta special sauce?
BUFFY	I'll get it.
BUFFY	Welcome to the Doublemeat Palace, how may I... help ...
RILEY	Hey.
BUFFY	Hurn?
BUFFY	Riley.
RILEY	I'm sorry to just drop in on you like this, Buffy
BUFFY	It's you.
RILEY	It's me.
BUFFY	You're here.
RILEY	I know.
BUFFY	And -- were you always this tall?
RILEY	This isn't the way I wanted it, but something's come up. Something big. We don't have much time. You understand?
BUFFY	Not a word you've said so far.
RILEY	Right. I should have known -- anticipated. You're working.
BUFFY	Just counter, not grill ...
RILEY	I want to explain. But don't have time. I've been up forty-eight hours straight tracking something bad to Sunnydale and now it's here.
BUFFY	My hat has a cow.
RILEY	I know I'm putting you on the spot showing up like this, but here we are. I need the best. I need you, Buffy Can you help me?
TODD	Uh, hello -- Buffy? People are Waiting...
RILEY	What's that guy's deal?
BUFFY	Todd? He's got just enough authority to make my life miserable.
RILEY	You sure this is all right? I don't want to get you fired.
BUFFY	From the Doublemeat Palace? Tougher than you'd think. So you're tracking a demon.
RILEY	As per usual.
RILEY	Look. I'm sorry this is all so sudden. If we get a minute, I'd really like to carve out some time and maybe we could ...
BUFFY	What is it?
RILEY	Suvolte Demon. Rare. Lethal. Nearly extinct, but not nearly enough. And it's close, Buffy
BUFFY	I'm sorry, I just... you still carry around all the James Bond stuff. It's so cute, I forgot.
RILEY	We've been tear-assing through every jungle from Paraguay up, taking out nests.
BUFFY	Got it. Like really mean Tribbles. I've been dealing with some geeks lately, it's a whole thing.
RILEY	You ready for this?
BUFFY	Yes please.
RILEY	National Forestry Service! We got a wild bear! Everybody step back!
BUFFY	Uh... I'm with him.
RILEY	Aagh!
BUFFY	I'll feel better when we catch it.
RILEY	I wouldn't necessarily say that.
BUFFY	Nice wheels.
RILEY	Came with the car.
BUFFY	Know where we're going?
RILEY	Got an idea.
BUFFY	How's the arm?
RILEY	It'll heal. How're you doing?
BUFFY	Complicated question.
RILEY	I just meant --
BUFFY	I know.
RILEY	I hear you. Got big stories to tell you, too. We get half a sec, we can compare and contrast.
BUFFY	Did you die?
RILEY	No.
BUFFY	I'm gonna win...
RILEY	Here.
BUFFY	Ninja wear?
RILEY	Battle gear. Lightweight kevlar. State of the art.
BUFFY	What a surprise.
RILEY	Boys like toys. Put it on. Thank me later.
BUFFY	You won't look?
RILEY	I'm a gentleman.
BUFFY	Okay. So the black ops life - it's working out for you?
RILEY	Don't suck.
BUFFY	They got dental?
RILEY	We're covered. You know, there's not a lot people I'd ask to risk their life for me, Buffy It's good to see you.
BUFFY	Thanks.
RILEY	Welcome. And Buffy?
ANYA	I think maybe we died in this car on the way to the airport. And now we're in hell.
XANDER	The radio said no traffic.
ANYA	It's a hell radio. Of course it said that. We'll never get to the airport in time to pick up your stupid uncle.
XANDER	It only gives him more time at the bar. Trust me -- He'll be happy.
ANYA	Oh, great -- so he can sleep off a drunken stupor on our newly re- upholstered couch?
XANDER	He can't afford a hotel!
XANDER	I'm not. I hate my uncle. I hate my whole family. That's why I'm marrying you -- to start a new family, have children, make them hate us, then, when they get married -- sleep on their couch. It's the circle of life.
ANYA	The Gnarols are teleporting in in twenty minutes. If I'm not there to greet them, somebody's getting incinerated.
XANDER	Why did we ever agree to let your friends -- who are demons -- and my family -- who are monsters -- stay at our place?
ANYA	I can only do so much, Xander! Planning this Marriage is like staging the invasion of Normandy.
XANDER	Without the laughs. We should have eloped.
ANYA	No -- I've been through too much making this wedding happen -- and it is going to happen. It's going to be our perfect, perfect day if I have to kill every one of our guests and half this town to do it.
XANDDER	Those cool ranch?
ANYA	Cajun Fiesta.
RILEY	End of the line.
BUFFY	I don't see our Demon.
RILEY	It's not here.
BUFFY	Let me guess.
RILEY	Looks that way.
BUFFY	That's a big first step. So, Mr. Finn? You got an extra jet pack for a girl like me?
RILEY	Sorry. Fresh out of jet packs. Looks like we'll have to share.
RILEY	Can you hold on to me?
BUFFY	If that's what it takes.
BUFFY	Riley!
SAM	Hi there. What exactly are you doing with my husband?
BUFFY	Husband.
RILEY	Buffy, meet Sam. Sam -- Buffy.
SAM	Pleasure.
BUFFY	Demon.
SAM	Mine!
BUFFY	She's good.
RILEY	Sam's a special one.
BUFFY	How long you been married?
RILEY	Four months, almost.
BUFFY	Mazel tov. Any kids?
RILEY	Buffy, I meant to tell you. When the time was right -- and she caught up to us a hell of a lot faster than I would have guessed possible. She does that.
BUFFY	Uh-huh. You do a lot of this, then? The whole husband-wife tag- team demon fighting thing?
RILEY	It's what brought us together. I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte.
BUFFY	Call this your wedding gift.
RILEY	She killed it.
SAM	Oh honey, it's okay.
BUFFY	"Okay?" Wait. You guys have been tracking this thing, as a couple, for two days straight and -- you did want it dead, right?
SAM	Let me guess. Captain Can-Do here forgot to mention this was a homing operation. It's nice to finally meet you, by the way. Knife?
BUFFY	What's a homing operation?
RILEY	My bad. I should have explained.
BUFFY	That would have saved me ... some trouble.
SAM	Buffy, I know this situation's a little awkward. But, I really hope we can get to be friends.
BUFFY	That'd be my question.
SAM	If we weren't under severe time constraints, I would seriously consider ripping you a new one.
RILEY	Stand down, soldier.
BUFFY	Wait -- is he your boss, too?
SAM	He wishes. Better re-group. I hate to impose -- further, Buffy. But, you got a safe house?
BUFFY	I ... have a house. And I think it's safe. Sometimes, you can't even leave!
RILEY	I know the way. I'll fill you in. On everything.
BUFFY	So, you're what, a bounty hunter or something? I notice you're pretty good with that knife.
RILEY	Oh, Sam's a doctor. Joined our squad straight out of medical school.
BUFFY	Well, isn't that just perfect.
BUFFY	Sorry if the place is a bit of a mess. I've been too busy to give it a good ...
DAWN	Agent Finn returns.
RILEY	Hey. Dawn. Look at you. I think you grew about a foot and a half.
DAWN	Lot can happen in a year.
RILEY	Well, it's good to see you.
DAWN	Make yourselves at home.
XANDER	Hey, there's the man. The life taker and heart breaker. Y'know -- figuratively speaking.
WILLOW	We got your call.
XANDER	We're here to help. Just like old times, except for you being all big with the married life.
RILEY	Hear you're getting hitched yourself. Believe me -- you're gonna love it.
WILLOW	Congratulations. Really. Both of you!
BUFFY	Will. Thanks, but, no. I don't want to get all, you know -- petty.
WILLOW	That's the beauty. YOU can't, I can. Please. Let me carry the hate for both of us.
BUFFY	Go nuts.
DAWN	So. What brings you back in town after you left suddenly with no word?
RILEY	Sam and I have been tracking a Suvolte Demon from Central America. Killing machine. Nearly mature.
SAM	Three months old and growing fast.
RILEY	These things kill the minute they hatch and leave a real clear trail.
SAM	Yeah, just follow the villages with nothing in 'em but body parts.
RILEY	Uh, Dawny. You sure you wanna be hearing all this?
SAM	Ah, c'mon, Finn. She looks grown- up to me. If it's okay with you.
BUFFY	Sure. It's fine.
DAWN	So this Demon shredded your guys and now you're here, looking for a little payback?
SAM	It's come to the Hellmouth to spawn. Make a nest, lay its eggs, hatch a bunch of baby hostiles.
BUFFY	Which means we find the nest -- as in now -- or Sunnydale turns into the TROUBLE Meat Palace. I wish I'd said something else.
XANDER	Okay. So track the demon, find the nest, Mr. and Mrs. Finn here make with the killin', everyone goes home happy. But seriously, married man -- if forced to choose between a photographer or place settings ...
BUFFY	We can't track the demon. I killed it, okay? Who's hungry? We have, um ...
DAWN	Ice cubes.
BUFFY	All you can eat.
SAM	Buffy, it's a good thing you killed the Suvolte before it killed us. (to Xander) Disposable cameras.
XANDER	A-dur-hey?
SAM	Y'know. Little plastic ones? Ten bucks a pop. Arrange 'em like table settings, guests snap photos, it breaks the ice, and when the wedding's over -- you keep the pictures.
XANDER	I like it.
BUFFY	So, demon eggs. We got a timetable on when they hatch?
RILEY	Hatching's not the problem.
SAM	We think the eggs will be sold on the black market. There's some foreign military powers that'd love to have their own Suvolte. Could never train it, but drop it on an urban population ...
RILEY	And it "cleanses the area."
DAWN	Is that a nice way of saying it kills people?
SAM	Lots of them. Money's been exchanged. There's a dealer in town, calls himself "The Doctor." Willow: think you could help out with a little locating spell?
WILLOW	I can't do Magicks.
SAM	Riley says you were coming on as a major league Wicca.
WILLOW	I got addicted. You know, the way addicts do.
RILEY	Two teams. No civilians. I'll go out and look for our "Doctor," you two find the nest.
BUFFY	Me and Sam together?
RILEY	You find a Suvolte nest you'll want backup.
SAM	I don't want to be dragging down the Slayer.
BUFFY	Let's go.
RILEY	I'll hit the bars, Willie's, couple of crypts I know.
SAM	Just be a minute. And Honey, be careful. Remember Singapore?
RILEY	Like I could forget.
SAM	Hey. Willow. Um ... Back in the jungle we had not one but two hard core shamans working for us. They were working the dark Magicks. Got addicted. And now they're gone. "Gone" as in nothing left. I never met anyone with enough strength to quit before.
SAM	Thanks for letting me tag along.
BUFFY	No problem.
SAM	Not for you, maybe. I've got to tell you, Buffy. I'm a little intimidated. I mean, patrolling with the real-live Slayer... you're like ... Santa Claus or the Buddha or something.
BUFFY	Fat and jolly?
SAM	Legendary. And it's not just Slayer status I'm talking about. It's you.
BUFFY	So .. Riley talks about me?
SAM	A lot. You're a part of my life. Because you're a part of him. I tried hating you, at first But Riley wouldn't let me.
BUFFY	I wouldn't blame him if he called me... well you know. Called me names.
SAM	He didn't say anything for a very long time. But I could tell, he was ripped up inside.
BUFFY	Good thing he had you.
SAM	More like miraculous. I went down to Central America with the Peace Corps. One night, my entire infirmary got slaughtered by ... well I had no idea what they were. I got saved. Quit the corps. Joined the squad. My first major firefight, I meet Riley. Our squads nearly blew each other apart with heavy artillery.
BUFFY	It's just like a thirties screwball comedy.
SAM	Only with more dismemberment and concussion grenades.
BUFFY	So you improved on a classic.
SAM	Yeah. After a while, we started talking. First about tactics. Missions, stuff like that. Then about you.
BUFFY	He thinks I let him go.
SAM	Do you wish you hadn't?
BUFFY	I ... wish things were different. But I'm not trying to ... I mean I didn't -- I don't ... you know.
SAM	I didn't mean to put you on the spot. There's no bad guys in this one, Buffy. Sometimes I think we need a bad guy in our line of work, just to beat on.
BUFFY	And work out the pain.
SAM	Uh-huh. But, since you're not a monster, or a demon, the only thing that helped Rye work it out was time. Lots of time. It took him a year to get over you.
BUFFY	Well. I'm glad he's over me.
SAM	So you seeing anybody now? Anyone special?
BUFFY	Huh. Well, you know. I'm, uh, taking my time on that one. Don't want to rush into anything, or get defined by the guy I'm with.
SAM	Better no guy than the wrong guy, that's for sure.
BUFFY	Sam. You think we need to split up?
SAM	Oh. I'm slowing you down. I knew I would -- this was just selfish of me.
BUFFY	No. Not at all. I just have ... an informant. He's useful. But the guy's twitchy. I show up with company, we get nothing.
SAM	Cool. I'm guessing Finn needs me about now, anyway. He's probably out there getting his ass kicked. You know how wild he gets.
BUFFY	Yeah, I noticed.
SPIKE	Buffy! Hey now. If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
BUFFY	I need information.
SPIKE	Suppose I could be helpful. If the price is right. Not sure I'm selling out at Doublemeat Palace wages, though.
BUFFY	I need to find a guy. Dealer. Calls himself the Doctor.
SPIKE	Human?
BUFFY	His traffic isn't.
SPIKE	Clock ticking?
BUFFY	Whatever he's doing, he's doing it soon.
SPIKE	Soon but not now.
BUFFY	Tell me you love me.
BUFFY	Shut up.
SPIKE	Well looky here.
RILEY	Not why I'm here. "Doctor."
BUFFY	Oh, God...
SPIKE	Here I thought we run you out of town, mate. Last I saw you, if memory serves, you were getting the juice sucked out of you by some undead ladies of very questionable reputation. Now be a good tin soldier and ...
RILEY	Where are they, Doctor?
SPIKE	Where's what? And why you keep calling me that?
RILEY	Glad to be back in Sunnydale. Locals all speak English and I know who to beat for information. It all brought me here.
SPIKE	Look, crew-cut: she's not your bint anymore, and if I can speak frankly, she always had a little thing for me even when she was shagging you.
RILEY	Nice. Very distracting. Now tell me before I get unprofessional. Where are the eggs, Spike?
SPIKE	Eggs? Pht. You're off your nut. It's those drugs they were keeping you on. I did warn you.
RILEY	Okay. We can do this the hard way or we can do this the fatal way.
BUFFY	The "Doctor'... it can't be Spike.
SPIKE	No need to defend me, love.
BUFFY	This isn't possible He's too ... Incompetent! It's just Spike, Riley.
RILEY	Right. Deadly, amoral, opportunistic ... or have you forgotten?
SPIKE	Over my dead body.
RILEY	I've seen enough of your dead body for one night, thanks.
SPIKE	Well you're not gonna --
RILEY	You coming?
SPIKE	Oh, this is ... unconstitutional, is what this is. Here. There's nothing to see down there.
BUFFY	I'm not saying he's good, Riley, I'm just saying he's not capable of pulling off anything as sophisticated as ...
SPIKE	I can explain.
RILEY	We need more weapons. Spike screwed up. You didn't keep 'em frozen, did you, Doctor.
SPIKE	You can stop calling me that anytime. If I may: The thing of it is, I'm holding these for a friend, who ...
BUFFY	No more games, Spike.
SPIKE	That's bloody funny, coming from you? No games?
RILEY	Can you shut him up?
BUFFY	Not so far.
RILEY	You better get out of here, Buffy
BUFFY	Riley, I...
RILEY	Later. It'll keep -- aim high, plenty of lead -- they move fast.
BUFFY	I'm not exactly gun gal.
RILEY	Want to live? Learn fast.
BUFFY	These things are never useful...
RILEY	We have to pull out.
RILEY	We need a way to contain --
XANDER	He's taken. And that's not my point.
ANYA	You think their marriage is better than ours? Is that it?
XANDER	No! I mean, granted, it's hard to imagine Nick and Nora Fury hiding out from relatives in their own bathroom.
ANYA	Well you haven't shut up about them.
XANDER	They have a great marriage. It bummed Buffy out, but I could see it -- and Anya? I have no clue what their wedding was like.
ANYA	So ... our wedding ... is not our marriage.
XANDER	Separate things. One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements.
ANYA	That would be the wedding.
XANDER	Which will soon be over.
ANYA	But the marriage ...
XANDER	That lasts forever.
ANYA	Huh. Well.
BUFFY	So, you and Sam go back to Central America now? Or is that classified?
RILEY	Nepal.
BUFFY	Sounds fun.
RILEY	I'll send you a post card.
RILEY	Buffy, listen...
BUFFY	And then you come, and... did you wait until your life was absolutely perfect and then send some demon here so you could throw it in my face?
RILEY	You think this was easy for me?
BUFFY	Yes! I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun for the whole family!
RILEY	Buffy, I was terrified about seeing you again.
BUFFY	Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow for you.
RILEY	I don't know what you're talking about
BUFFY	Oh please don't be --
RILEY	Hey. You want me to say I liked seeing you in bed with that idiot? Or that blinding orange is your very best color, or that the burger smell is --
BUFFY	You smelled the smell?
RILEY	Buffy, none of that means anything. It doesn't touch you. You're still the first woman I ever loved and the strongest woman I ever knew. And I'm not advertising this to the missus, but still quite the hottie.
BUFFY	You know it goes away after many bathings...
RILEY	This isn't about who's on top. I know how lucky I am right now. I love my work, and I love my wife.
BUFFY	I know. I kind of love her too.
RILEY	So right now you're not in the greatest place. Maybe I made it worse.
BUFFY	No.
RILEY	Wheel never stops turning, Buffy. You're up, you're down, doesn't change what you are. And you're a hell of a woman.
BUFFY	I never got the chance to tell you how sorry I was. About what happened with us.
RILEY	And you never have to.
SAM	... Well the wedding itself was held in a military chopper just before a hairy night drop into hostile territory.
XANDER	Huh. And, just curious, how much a chopper rental run you these days?
SAM	Well actually, we commandeered it from a local guerilla squad, so - cheap. (to Willow) You have my e-mail. Promise you'll stay in touch.
WILLOW	You won't get traced? I don't want to give any bad guys your location by mistake.
SAM	Our line's secure.
WILLOW	Oh. Duh! Of course it is. I keep thinking you're all, like regular people. But you're not.
SAM	Right, like demon hunting's all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale.
DAWN	So, you gonna say goodbye this time or just split all secret- agenty like last time?
RILEY	Depends. I warrant a hug?
DAWN	I thought it would suck less this time. Doesn't.
SAM	It was great meeting you all. Ready for Nepal, agent?
RILEY	Firefights. Bug hunts. Big body count. Yeah, I could use a break.
WILLOW	What a bitch.
SPIKE	So she's back. Thought you'd be off snogging with soldier boy.
BUFFY	He's gone.
SPIKE	So, come for a little cold comfort? Bed's a bit blown up, but then that never was our --
BUFFY	No. I'm not here for... and I'm not gonna bust your chops about your stupid evil scheme. That's just you. I should've remembered...
SPIKE	Oh. This is worse, isn't it? This is you telling me --
BUFFY	Yeah. It's over.
SPIKE	(comes at her, sexy) I've memorized this tune, love. I think I have the sheet music. Doesn't change what you want.
BUFFY	I know that. I do want you. Being with you... makes things simpler. For a little while.
SPIKE	I don't call five hours straight a little while.
BUFFY	I'm using you. I can't love you. I'm just being weak, and selfish --
SPIKE	-- really not complaining here --
BUFFY	-- and it's killing me. I have to be strong about this.

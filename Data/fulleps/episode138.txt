ANDREW	Oh! Hello there, gentle viewers!
ANDREW	Ouch. My goodness. Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they? She didn't see that second vampire, concealed by cover of darkness, ready-
ANDREW	Let's rejoin them now to see--
ANYA	For God's sake, Andrew! You've been in here thirty minutes, what are you doing?
ANDREW	Um, well, part of that was the opening theme song...
BUFFY	I told you, I don't want you doing that. It's distracting.
ANDREW	I'll cut this footage together and do the intro tomorrow. "She was a woman in danger... or was she?"
BUFFY	Are you still filming me? Stop filming me!
ANDREW	But the story needs...
ANDREW	...to be told!
ANYA	And birds need to fly and girls need to use the toilet. Why were you videotaping yourself anyway? Sounds like kinky business to me.
ANDREW	The world is going to want to know about Buffy. It's a story of ultimate triumph tinged with bitterness for what has been lost in the struggle. This is a document for the ages, for future generations.
ANYA	If there are any. Buffy seems to think this apocalypse is going to actually be, you know, apocalyptic. I think your project sounds pretty pointless.
ANDREW	Oh. And I was gonna interview you later today. Flattering angle, maybe a key light on your pretty, pretty eyes, really bring 'em out...
ANYA	They were always my best feature, even as a demon. Other demons would comment.
ANDREW	Let's explore the world of our story, shall we? This is Sunnydale California. Buffy, a Slayer of the vampires, lives here in Sunnydale. Which is good because there is a Hellmouth under the town. Right here. No wait. Here. Under the high school. A Hellmouth is a source for, like, dark energy. Weird things happen on a Hellmouth. It also attracts all kinds of bad people and demons and vampires.
ANDREW	It's morning in Sunnydale and the--
RONA	Who the hell's got the low-fat milk?
ANDREW	It's morning in Sunnydale and the women of command central take the time to fortify themselves for the day ahead.
XANDER	Hey.
ANDREW	Women and Xander. I'm gonna do a special intro for you later. The man who is the heart of the Slayer machine.
XANDER	Yeah? The heart?
ANDREW	Things are tense in command central this morning. Buffy is clearly concerned about some unknown danger, and the air is filled with foreboding.
DAWN	We're out of raisin bran.
ANYA	I'll put it on the list.
ANDREW	That's probably not the unknown danger.
SPIKE	Look at this place. Damn girls' dorm, s'what it is.
DAWN	Nice. Second-hand stinkiness.
ANDREW	It's a full house. I think it's a good time for some introductions, don't you, gentle viewers?
AMANDA	I'm Amanda and I grew up right here--
ANDREW	Not you, sweetheart. Let's start at the top.
BUFFY	Oh for God's sake.
RONA	I don't know. If we save the world, it will be nice to have a record of it.
AMANDA	And if we don't, well, I guess nothing matters.
KENNEDY	Lovely attitude.
BUFFY	Come on, no one else thinks this is idiotic? We're the Army of the Slayer, not the Army of the Slayer Film School.
XANDER	But it is kind of a shame you keep saving the world and there's not any proof.
ANYA	Yeah. For future generations.
WILLOW	And it helps the girls with their training, you know, reviewing the tapes.
BUFFY	Someone must agree with me on this. Spike?
SPIKE	Long's he's not pointin' that thing at me, seems like a fine way to keep the boy busy.
BUFFY	This is not about keeping busy! This is about WAR!
A	horrible vision. Hundreds upon hundreds of...
ANDREW	Honestly, gentle viewers, these motivating speeches of hers get a little long. I'll take you back in there a little later. In the in between-time, I thought you might want to know a little about me, your humble host. I'm a man with a burden, a man with a dark past...
ANDREW	Thus, the validity of the Bronsted- Debye-Huckel equation at low ionic strength has been amply tested and the charges on the reactant ions are well-known if the reagents are properly characterized.
JONATHAN	It smells funny.
ANDREW	I know. Kinda sweaty.
WARREN	What'll it do to Buffy?
ANDREW	Make her super-magnetic.
JONATHAN	Wow. She won't be able to get out of her car.
WARREN	And knives and other sharp things will fly at her.
ANDREW	We could walk right by her and she wouldn't be able to stop us.
JONATHAN	Unless we were wearing, like, metal belt buckles, cuz then we'd stick to her.
ANDREW	In my plan, we are beltless.
JONATHAN	Wow. You're the best, Andrew.
WARREN	Yep. Good-looking, and smart too.
ANDREW	Warren was cool. And wasn't Jonathan just the cutest thing? Well, shall we see if Buffy's still talking?
BUFFY	...more than just a battle. It's going to be a battle like we've never seen before.
ANDREW	You see, Kennedy pursued the reluctant Willow and won her heart, only to find herself frightened when she glimpsed the darkness that still dwells within the witch's mind. Side note: I once had my own personal encounter with Dark Willow...
WILLOW	Jonathan. Andrew.
JONATHAN	Yiiiii!
ANDREW	Haltem.
WILLOW	Okay, I didn't see that coming.
ANDREW	That's because we have power you can't imagine.
JONATHAN	We do?
ANDREW	You, Dark Willow, wield a force of mighty evil, it is true, but you are new to the game, little one.
WILLOW	So which one of you worked the mojo?
JONATHAN	Um... both of us. We're both very, very extremely strong.
ANDREW	You and I know that's not true. I am your match, little one. I am the one you fear. Care to try my mettle again?
WILLOW	You know what they say - if at first you don't succeed...
JONATHAN	Holy cats here it comes again.
ANDREW	I deflect thy power.
WILLOW	Damn, that is one effective counter- spell.
ANDREW	Thank you, little one. Thank you.
ANDREW	She was something. Indeed she was.
BUFFY	Not late. Not late 'til the bell rings...
GIRL	You knew I was there! You noticed me!
BUFFY	Yes. I did, it's okay, I--
GIRL	The mirror said I was fat! It said it!
BOY	So not only does Mr. Hildebrand move up the trig exam to today, but he also makes it cover three more chapters and I've got an English paper due tomorrow! I feel like I'm gonna explode .
BUFFY	I heard you. I can help. Someone give this boy a foot massage, okay?
BOY	What?!
BUFFY	Turn in the paper late. Skip the test. I'll say you're sick. Just don't explode.
BOY	I didn't mean it, like, literally.
BUFFY	And yet. Really. Take it easy. Foot-rub good.
BUFFY	Something bad's going on.
WOOD	Tell me you're using that exciting bad-is-good street language of the last forty years.
BUFFY	Things are, sort of, coming true. Like, all the hidden feelings of high school. You know, like, I'm fat or everyone's looking at me, or no one's looking at me...
WOOD	I don't understand.
BUFFY	I've been at this school a lot longer than you have. I've seen it before, just never all at once. Someone feels something in here and before you know it, stuff is happening and death is popping out all over.
ANDREW	Hellmouth.
WOOD	I haven't heard of any problems today.
BUFFY	It's starting small, but unless we do something, you're gonna have a riot.
WOOD	A riot?
BUFFY	Yeah. Because the students feel like the teachers are out to get them. And the chess club resents the French club for taking the activities room. And everybody hates the cheerleaders. Being in high school can feel like being at war... and now it's true.
WOOD	I don't know about this--
BUFFY	I hate to say it. But I think that was the sound of an exploding freshman.
DAWN	Hello.
DAWN	Is that all you needed me for?
ANDREW	Yes. Thank you. You're the best.
ANDREW	This is the Slayer dining room. We were here before, but let's take a good look. As you can see, it's the room of a busy woman. Too busy to cook. Too busy to clean. She's really busy.
WOOD	I think our biggest problem is here in the music room. I fear there could be open hostilities between swing choir and the marching band.
BUFFY	This is crazy.
WOOD	Really? Because this is exactly what they prepared us for in principal college.
BUFFY	I mean, we can't handle this by, like, beating up one insane student at a time. We have to get to the source of it.
WOOD	That thing in the basement.
BUFFY	The seal of Danthalzar.
WOOD	But we could beat up maybe one or two students on the way?
BUFFY	Okay.
ANDREW	This is Xander and Anya interview number one for "Buffy: A Slayer of the Vampires."
ANYA	That's what you're calling it?
ANDREW	Either that or "Buffy: The Slayer Who Knew No Fear."
XANDER	I like that one.
ANDREW	Thank you, Xander. That's sweet of you. I understand that exactly one year ago today you left Anya at the altar. Any comment on that?
XANDER	Whoa. What the hell?
ANDREW	I just think people will be interested.
ANYA	I know I am. What do you have to say for yourself one year later?
XANDER	I've apologized enough. That's what I have to say.
ANDREW	But you think it was something that called for an apology.
XANDER	Well, yes.
ANDREW	So, you don't think it was the right thing to do.
ANYA	Of course he doesn't think it was the right thing to do!
XANDER	It was the right thing to do.
ANYA	What?!
ANDREW	Interesting. I feel like we're getting to something here.
XANDER	Look Anya . If I'd married you, it would've always been against what I thought was best. It wouldn't have worked!
ANYA	But... but... we still... we still spark! I get jealous of you, you get jealous of me! You still love me!
ANDREW	Ooh. Is that true, Xander? Do you still love her?
BUFFY	I swear we just covered this up.
WOOD	It doesn't want to stay hidden any more. It wants to turn these kids into monsters and victims and who knows what.
BUFFY	It wants to do more than that. Listen, Robin. I had a... there was a kind of... vision that I had recently.
WOOD	You have visions?
BUFFY	Sometimes.
WOOD	How can you tell they're not just dreams?
BUFFY	If you're, like, running to catch the bus naked, it's a dream. Army of vicious vampire creatures, that's a vision. Also, I was awake.
WOOD	A bus to where? I mean, an army? How many?
BUFFY	Hundreds. Maybe hundreds of hundreds.
WOOD	We've got to find out more about this thing. Have you ever really studied it... gotten close?
BUFFY	I know it's a goat's head with its tongue out. Willow did a search for that in the symbology data bases. Turns out everyone loves goat's tongue... covens and rock groups and Greek cookbooks. She said she couldn't narrow it down.
WOOD	And you trust her?
BUFFY	What? Why wouldn't I trust her?
WOOD	I don't see why any of you should trust each other. You've all been evil at some point, right?
BUFFY	No. What? That's not true. Willow had a... a... bad patch. But I haven't been--
WOOD	Evil is what evil does, right? And I know what you're doing.
BUFFY	Robin! Are you okay?
WOOD	Whoa. What happened?
BUFFY	You were... I think it was controlling you.
WOOD	We have to get rid of this Seal. Shut it down. Before it drives the whole town crazy or starts disgorging an army.
BUFFY	What's that noise?
WOOD	If it's about to disgorge an army it sounds like a tiny one.
SPIKE	Thought I told you to piss bloody off with that bloody camera. 'N here you are again with that thing in my face. Sod off 'fore I shove that bleedin' thing up your ass, right?
SPIKE	Right.
ANYA	You keep ducking the question.
XANDER	I don't mean to. Anyway, you were the one who didn't want to keep seeing each other.
ANYA	Please, stop this. Just tell me. Are you saying you still love me?
XANDER	Of course I still love you. I always will. I just don't know if that means anything for us anymore.
ANYA	I love you too. And I don't know if that means anything either.
XANDER	Well, it's nice to hear.
ANYA	And, the thing is, I miss you.
XANDER	I'm right here.
ANYA	It's not the same. I miss having you here, in my head. There was always this little part of my brain that was... aware of you, you know? Like, noticing things to tell you later, or wondering what you were doing right then. And that part's all empty now.
XANDER	We could've kept that. I just wasn't ready for marriage, that's all. I didn't want to, you know, get evicted from your head.
ANYA	I was too hurt. I couldn't.
XANDER	I'm sorry.
ANYA	It's okay.
XANDER	Hey, Anya.
ANYA	Yeah?
XANDER	You need anything from me... I'm right here.
XANDER	I'm sorry.
ANYA	It's okay.
XANDER	Hey, Anya.
ANYA	Yeah?
XANDER	You need anything from me... I'm right here.
ANDREW	Hey Anya... Yeah?... You need anything from me... I'm right here.
WOOD	We just spent the day keeping the lid on a riot.
ANDREW	Oooh. That would've been very exciting on tape.
BUFFY	Put down the camera, Andrew. You're not just watching anymore. You're right in the middle of this.
JONATHAN	Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod...
ANDREW	Hey-suus.
JONATHAN	Did you have it again? I had it again!
ANDREW	And that voice... "desme abdo tay deborah" What does it mean? What does it mean ?
JONATHAN	Let's try looking it up again in the morning, in the Dictionario. Holy cow, that was terrifying.
ANDREW	We're fugitives, haunted by our past, tormented by a message we don't understand...
JONATHAN	We're hunted men, driven mad by forces beyond our understanding...
ANDREW	Men of faded power, tortured from within by a voice out of nowhere--
JONATHAN	I don't deserve this. I wasn't even that evil.
ANDREW	I thought you were evil.
JONATHAN	Yeah?
ANDREW	Sure. I respected your ideas for evil projects and I thought you had good follow-through.
JONATHAN	Oh. Well, thanks. It's nice that you noticed.
ANDREW	I don't want to do this anymore. Everyone's staring at me.
WILLOW	Just focus on the charm. You have to focus on the charm to pull the memories out.
WOOD	Tell us about the Seal.
ANDREW	But it tickles and I'm all tense. Can't I have a Zima?
BUFFY	No Zima!
SPIKE	Shut your face about the Zima. Just talk.
XANDER	You were the first person to uncover it and feed it blood. How did you even know it was there? How did you know to do that?
ANDREW	I don't know! Stuff happened. I forget.
KENNEDY	So remember. Look at the charm.
ANDREW	I'm not a part of this. I document. I don't participate. I'm the detached journalist, recording with a neutral eye--
BUFFY	Andrew. Stop it or I smash that camera over your head. Actually, I'm gonna do that either way. You're in this. So talk.
WILLOW	And stop going off topic.
ANDREW	I wasn't off topic. It's gonna get relevant in a second. Because Jonathan's gonna go to the bathroom.
JONATHAN	I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
ANDREW	La cucaracha... la cucaracha... la la la la la la-la.
ANDREW	Warren! Oh, gosh, I'm glad to see you.
FIRST	Me too. You're looking good.
ANDREW	Am I? I've prob'ly got pillow creases--
FIRST	No, no. It's good. You're a man on the run. You got a kinda wild and desperate thing going.
ANDREW	Neat. Hey, Warren? I get why Jonathan has to have these dreams, so he'll go back to Sunnydale with me... but how come I have to have 'em too? Couldn't I just tell him I do? They're simply awful.
FIRST	You have to have the dreams. You can't pretend that well. Don't worry about it. You got the knife?
ANDREW	Yeah. It wasn't easy. I had to meet this demon guy who was selling all kinds of weird weapons and stuff--
FIRST	Show me.
ANDREW	Well, I didn't buy them, but there were poison arrows and this sort of collapsible sword...
FIRST	Show me the knife .
ANDREW	Oh, right.
FIRST	Quick, before Shortcakes comes back.
ANDREW	Jonathan? It'll be a while. He's got a shy bladder. Jonathan, you okay?
ANDREW	Pretty knife. Except... the stabbing... I don't think I can do it. Jonathan has been a good friend to me here in Mexico. He said he'll buy me a burro .
FIRST	You can stab him. It's all part of the plan. That boy's blood is a powerful tribute. It's a gift to something very big, very important. And ultimately it won't even hurt him! We get a reward, you and me and him too.
ANDREW	We live as gods.
FIRST	That's right, man. The trio. Livin' as gods.
ANDREW	We are as Gods! We are as Gods!
FIRST	There is power in that knife. Drive the words deep into him. It's the only way for us to get our reward.
ANDREW	Got it. If I kill him with this knife, we will live as gods.
WILLOW	Go back. What was that part again?
ANDREW	Oh. You mean this part?
BOYS	Gods are we! Merry gods are we!
WILLOW	Not that part!
BUFFY	Dawn, search his stuff. Find the knife.
ANDREW	It's not in my stuff. It's in the kitchen. In the cutlery drawer.
XANDER	You put your old murder weapon in with our stuff?
ANDREW	I washed it.
WOOD	Still.
ANDREW	And... I couldn't see it. Didn't want to see it. Didn't want it reminding me.
KENNEDY	Such a sentimental killer.
SPIKE	What're you looking for?
WILLOW	He said The First said something about "words." Like, "drive the words deep into him."
ANDREW	There was carving, on the blade. I just thought it was a pattern.
DAWN	Found it.
WILLOW	You're mister demon-summoner. How are you at demon languages?
ANDREW	Whoa. You're right. It's in Tawarick. Or, like, proto-Tawarick. This is really, really old. It says "the blood which I spill I... I consecrate to the oldest evil."
KENNEDY	Creepy. But what's the big?
WOOD	We've never known anything about this Seal. Now we know that this knife and this language is connected to it somehow.
BUFFY	Andrew, can you speak this Tawarick?
ANDREW	Yeah. I'm okay with it--
BUFFY	You're coming with us to the Seal.
DAWN	So he can do what, yell at it in its own language?
WILLOW	Maybe.
WOOD	What? I'm not following.
BUFFY	This Seal already almost caused a riot, and it only took it a day to do it. In a week it'll drive the whole town insane. We've got to do something right now.
WILLOW	And this is the only thing we've got. The Seal responds to this language somehow, or The First wouldn't've needed this knife. Andrew knows the language. There's got to be something there.
BUFFY	Sounds good to me.
SPIKE	Really?
BUFFY	Well, it's better than nothing and we're desperate. Everyone get ready to go.
KENNEDY	So she says "everyone get ready to go." And I'm thinking, great, I'm ready, I've been training. Turns out she's not taking me or my girls. Not even taking Willow. You know who she's taking? The men. And you, Andrew. All the girls get left behind. You wouldn't think Buffy'd play it like that. She's not turning out like I thought she'd be.
KENNEDY	Guess you'd better go. M'lady's calling you.
OMITTED	30 THRU 34
BUFFY	Remember that riot that almost happened today?
WOOD	Looks to me like it happened after all.
SPIKE	Looks to me like it's still happening.
ANDREW	It feels like four against the world, gentle viewers, as we step into the belly of the beast.
XANDER	Well.
ANYA	Well, well.
XANDER	That was nice.
ANYA	It certainly was, you carpenter you.
XANDER	Too bad Buffy took Spike's chains down.
ANYA	You said it.
XANDER	I felt good.
ANYA	Well, yes. I'm a spitfire in the bedroom. But did it feel... like we used to feel?
XANDER	It was different.
ANYA	I guess we should expect that. We're different now.
XANDER	Yeah. There wasn't that... I don't know...
ANYA	That feeling.
XANDER	Right.
ANYA	Yeah.
XANDER	Does this mean we're really over?
ANYA	I guess it does.
XANDER	Not yet. I don't want it to be over yet. Can't you stay a little longer?
ANYA	So we can do what? Pretend this is still us? Pretend it's not over and we still feel something we don't?
XANDER	Yeah. Pretend that exact thing. Just for a little while.
ANYA	Okay.
SPIKE	Nice way to run a school. There's gotta be kids injured in here.
WOOD	Yeah. Easy pickings for likes of you, huh?
SPIKE	Hey. Here to help, you know.
WOOD	Right.
ANDREW	Check out Spike and the Principal. There's something going on there. Sexual tension you could cut with a knife.
TEEN	Do you belong to us?
BUFFY	Um... what?
TEEN	Are you of the marching band or the swing choir?
ANDREW	I tried out for swing choir once.
BUFFY	We are of the marching band.
TEEN	You may pass in safety.
OMITTED	37 THRU 40
SPIKE	These kids went nuts, din't they.
WOOD	Shh. They're still here.
BUFFY	I can hear them. Are they in the classrooms?
WOOD	Ahhh!
ANDREW	Principal Wood!
BUFFY	Robin!
I	achieve redemption...
BUFFY	Spike! Don't kill them! They're just kids!
RONA	The thing about Buffy? Is that everything 's about Buffy. She thinks the world revolves around her tiny little body.
AMANDA	She is the Slayer. She's gonna save the world.
RONA	Yep. All by herself. Because she wants it that way.
BUFFY	Spike. Wood. I need you to stay here. Keep the way clear for our retreat.
WOOD	You think more kids'll find us?
SPIKE	They're smelling blood now. They'll find us.
ANDREW	Can I stay with.. . (off her look, to the men) I'll be with Buffy.
ANDREW	We make our way down the stairs carefully, alert for any danger.
BUFFY	Stop it!
ANDREW	But I was just--
BUFFY	No more.
ANDREW	I just want the world to see what you do.
BUFFY	What I do is too important to take the time to show it to the world.
ANDREW	Ooh. I like that.
BUFFY	Be quiet, Andrew. I don't want a biographer. Especially a murderer.
ANDREW	Yeah, well, see, about that? We just keep tossing that word around. But that's not really what happened.
BUFFY	What? You stabbed Jonathan to death! What were you trying to do, scratch his back from the front?
ANDREW	Well, see, it was confusing. Jonathan and I were digging, but Warren was there, and only I could see him...
JONATHAN	But I care about them . That's why I'm doing this.
FIRST	Do it. Stab him.
ANDREW	No. I won't do it.
JONATHAN	What?
FIRST	Do it now !
ANDREW	This isn't right.
FIRST	Stab him. Spill the blood. What's wrong with you, you little coward? JONATHAN Who are you talking to? What isn't right?
ANDREW	No! Did you really think I could use this?
FIRST	That's good. Just do it. It'll feel good. JONATHAN (getting angry) A knife! What's going on?
ANDREW	He's making me do it!
JONATHAN	No! You tricked me! Damn you! I'll kill you first!
FIRST	Stab him! You have to! You'll die a lost soul if you fail and I'll hate you forever! JONATHAN I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
ANDREW	NO!
ANDREW	You see, I'm a man, trapped by circumstances into paying for a crime I didn't--
BUFFY	I saw the Seal possess Robin-- Principal Wood earlier. That's what I thought you were going to say.
ANDREW	Yes! Yes! See...
JONATHAN	...that's why I'm doing this.
ANDREW	Die! Die! Die!
BUFFY	You just completely changed your story!
ANDREW	Did not!
BUFFY	You did so!
ANDREW	Did-- hey look, we're here.
BUFFY	So now I know where little Bringers come from.
SPIKE	Wonder what's keepin' em. Thought they'd be up by now.
WOOD	Wood shop, I guess. Nice to know they're paying attention in class.
BUFFY	Stay back.
BUFFY	It's your turn, Andrew.
ANDREW	So we figure what? I stand on the Seal and hold the knife and like, command it to stop glowing? In Tawarick?
BUFFY	Or we do this.
ANDREW	What...
BUFFY	Does it really make sense? Bringing you here to talk to it? This thing doesn't understand words. It understands blood.
ANDREW	Blood opens it. You don't want to open it. Opening it would be bad.
BUFFY	Well, we looked into that. Seems the blood of the man that awoke it... you... that's a different kind of deal. Reverses the whole thing.
ANDREW	How... how much blood are you gonna...?
BUFFY	I don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.
ANDREW	I could cleanse myself with a small amount of my own blood. A man who buys back his own bruised soul with the blood of his heart--
BUFFY	Stop that! Stop telling stories! Life is not a story!
ANDREW	Sorry, sorry.
BUFFY	Shut up. You always do that, make everything into a story so no one's responsible for anything because it's just like, following some script. Life isn't a story. Life is a bunch of stuff that we choose to do. You're not a tragic hero. You're a guy who killed his friend. And I'm not some--I don't know half as much as you think I do. I'm making it up. And I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we can all come through this thing if we work together, because we can't . People are going to die. Girls. Maybe me. Probably you. Probably right now.
ANDREW	Don't... please...
BUFFY	When a river of your blood pours out, Andrew, it might save the world. What do you think of that? Does it make you a world-saver? Does it buy it all back? Are you a hero redeemed?
ANDREW	No.
I	listened to Warren and I pretended that I thought it was him. But I knew it wasn't. And I killed Jonathan. And you're going to kill me and I'm afraid and I'm going to die. And this is what Jonathan felt.
BUFFY	It didn't want your blood. It wanted your tears.
ANDREW	Thanks.
BUFFY	That's okay. I'm sorry I had to...
ANDREW	Did you know it was the tears? Or did you really think it was blood and then you saw that the tears worked?
BUFFY	I just told you, I usually don't know as much as you think I do.
WOOD	She got it done.
SPIKE	Always has.
WOOD	So far.
ANDREW	Hello, gentle viewers. Here's the thing. I killed my best friend. There's a big fight coming up and I think I'm going to die. And I guess that's how it should be.
ANYA	For God's sake, Andrew! You've been in here thirty minutes, what are you doing?
ANDREW	Um, well, part of that was the opening theme song...
ANDREW	I'll cut this footage together and do the intro tomorrow. "She was a woman in danger... or was she?"
BUFFY	Are you still filming me? Stop filming me!
ANDREW	But the story needs...
ANDREW	...to be told!
ANYA	And birds need to fly and girls need to use the toilet. Why were you videotaping yourself anyway? Sounds like kinky business to me.
ANDREW	The world is going to want to know about Buffy. It's a story of ultimate triumph tinged with bitterness for what has been lost in the struggle. This is a document for the ages, for future generations.
ANYA	If there are any. Buffy seems to think this apocalypse is going to actually be, you know, apocalyptic. I think your project sounds pretty pointless.
ANDREW	Oh. And I was gonna interview you later today. Flattering angle, maybe a key light on your pretty, pretty eyes, really bring 'em out...
ANDREW	It's morning in Sunnydale and the--
RONA	Who the hell's got the low-fat milk?
ANDREW	It's morning in Sunnydale and the women of command central take the time to fortify themselves for the day ahead.
XANDER	Hey.
ANDREW	Women and Xander. I'm gonna do a special intro for you later. The man who is the heart of the Slayer machine.
XANDER	Yeah? The heart?
ANDREW	Things are tense in command central this morning. Buffy is clearly concerned about some unknown danger, and the air is filled with foreboding.
DAWN	We're out of raisin bran.
ANYA	I'll put it on the list.
ANDREW	That's probably not the unknown danger.
AMANDA	I'm Amanda and I grew up right here--
ANDREW	Not you, sweetheart. Let's start at the top.
BUFFY	Oh for God's sake.
RONA	I don't know. If we save the world, it will be nice to have a record of it.
AMANDA	And if we don't, well, I guess nothing matters.
KENNEDY	Lovely attitude.
BUFFY	Come on, no one else thinks this is idiotic? We're the Army of the Slayer, not the Army of the Slayer Film School.
XANDER	But it is kind of a shame you keep saving the world and there's not any proof.
ANYA	Yeah. For future generations.
WILLOW	And it helps the girls with their training, you know, reviewing the tapes.
BUFFY	Someone must agree with me on this. Spike?
SPIKE	Long's he's not pointin' that thing at me, seems like a fine way to keep the boy busy.
BUFFY	This is not about keeping busy! This is about WAR!
ANDREW	Thus, the validity of the Bronsted- Debye-Huckel equation at low ionic strength has been amply tested and the charges on the reactant ions are well-known if the reagents are properly characterized.
JONATHAN	It smells funny.
ANDREW	I know. Kinda sweaty.
WARREN	What'll it do to Buffy?
ANDREW	Make her super-magnetic.
JONATHAN	Wow. She won't be able to get out of her car.
WARREN	And knives and other sharp things will fly at her.
ANDREW	We could walk right by her and she wouldn't be able to stop us.
JONATHAN	Unless we were wearing, like, metal belt buckles, cuz then we'd stick to her.
ANDREW	In my plan, we are beltless.
JONATHAN	Wow. You're the best, Andrew.
WARREN	Yep. Good-looking, and smart too.
BUFFY	...more than just a battle. It's going to be a battle like we've never seen before.
WILLOW	Okay, I didn't see that coming.
ANDREW	That's because we have power you can't imagine.
JONATHAN	We do?
ANDREW	You, Dark Willow, wield a force of mighty evil, it is true, but you are new to the game, little one.
WILLOW	So which one of you worked the mojo?
JONATHAN	Um... both of us. We're both very, very extremely strong.
ANDREW	You and I know that's not true. I am your match, little one. I am the one you fear. Care to try my mettle again?
WILLOW	You know what they say - if at first you don't succeed...
ANDREW	I deflect thy power.
WILLOW	Damn, that is one effective counter- spell.
ANDREW	Thank you, little one. Thank you.
GIRL	You knew I was there! You noticed me!
BUFFY	Yes. I did, it's okay, I--
GIRL	The mirror said I was fat! It said it!
BUFFY	I heard you. I can help. Someone give this boy a foot massage, okay?
BOY	What?!
BUFFY	Turn in the paper late. Skip the test. I'll say you're sick. Just don't explode.
BOY	I didn't mean it, like, literally.
BUFFY	And yet. Really. Take it easy. Foot-rub good.
BUFFY	Something bad's going on.
WOOD	Tell me you're using that exciting bad-is-good street language of the last forty years.
BUFFY	Things are, sort of, coming true. Like, all the hidden feelings of high school. You know, like, I'm fat or everyone's looking at me, or no one's looking at me...
WOOD	I don't understand.
BUFFY	I've been at this school a lot longer than you have. I've seen it before, just never all at once. Someone feels something in here and before you know it, stuff is happening and death is popping out all over.
WOOD	I haven't heard of any problems today.
BUFFY	It's starting small, but unless we do something, you're gonna have a riot.
WOOD	A riot?
BUFFY	Yeah. Because the students feel like the teachers are out to get them. And the chess club resents the French club for taking the activities room. And everybody hates the cheerleaders. Being in high school can feel like being at war... and now it's true.
WOOD	I don't know about this--
BUFFY	I hate to say it. But I think that was the sound of an exploding freshman.
DAWN	Hello.
DAWN	Is that all you needed me for?
ANDREW	Yes. Thank you. You're the best.
WOOD	I think our biggest problem is here in the music room. I fear there could be open hostilities between swing choir and the marching band.
BUFFY	This is crazy.
WOOD	Really? Because this is exactly what they prepared us for in principal college.
BUFFY	I mean, we can't handle this by, like, beating up one insane student at a time. We have to get to the source of it.
WOOD	That thing in the basement.
BUFFY	The seal of Danthalzar.
WOOD	But we could beat up maybe one or two students on the way?
BUFFY	Okay.
ANYA	That's what you're calling it?
ANDREW	Either that or "Buffy: The Slayer Who Knew No Fear."
XANDER	I like that one.
ANDREW	Thank you, Xander. That's sweet of you. I understand that exactly one year ago today you left Anya at the altar. Any comment on that?
XANDER	Whoa. What the hell?
ANDREW	I just think people will be interested.
ANYA	I know I am. What do you have to say for yourself one year later?
XANDER	I've apologized enough. That's what I have to say.
ANDREW	But you think it was something that called for an apology.
XANDER	Well, yes.
ANDREW	So, you don't think it was the right thing to do.
ANYA	Of course he doesn't think it was the right thing to do!
XANDER	It was the right thing to do.
ANYA	What?!
ANDREW	Interesting. I feel like we're getting to something here.
XANDER	Look Anya . If I'd married you, it would've always been against what I thought was best. It wouldn't have worked!
ANYA	But... but... we still... we still spark! I get jealous of you, you get jealous of me! You still love me!
ANDREW	Ooh. Is that true, Xander? Do you still love her?
BUFFY	I swear we just covered this up.
WOOD	It doesn't want to stay hidden any more. It wants to turn these kids into monsters and victims and who knows what.
BUFFY	It wants to do more than that. Listen, Robin. I had a... there was a kind of... vision that I had recently.
WOOD	You have visions?
BUFFY	Sometimes.
WOOD	How can you tell they're not just dreams?
BUFFY	If you're, like, running to catch the bus naked, it's a dream. Army of vicious vampire creatures, that's a vision. Also, I was awake.
WOOD	A bus to where? I mean, an army? How many?
BUFFY	Hundreds. Maybe hundreds of hundreds.
WOOD	We've got to find out more about this thing. Have you ever really studied it... gotten close?
BUFFY	I know it's a goat's head with its tongue out. Willow did a search for that in the symbology data bases. Turns out everyone loves goat's tongue... covens and rock groups and Greek cookbooks. She said she couldn't narrow it down.
WOOD	And you trust her?
BUFFY	What? Why wouldn't I trust her?
WOOD	I don't see why any of you should trust each other. You've all been evil at some point, right?
BUFFY	No. What? That's not true. Willow had a... a... bad patch. But I haven't been--
WOOD	Whoa. What happened?
BUFFY	You were... I think it was controlling you.
WOOD	We have to get rid of this Seal. Shut it down. Before it drives the whole town crazy or starts disgorging an army.
BUFFY	What's that noise?
WOOD	If it's about to disgorge an army it sounds like a tiny one.
SPIKE	Thought I told you to piss bloody off with that bloody camera. 'N here you are again with that thing in my face. Sod off 'fore I shove that bleedin' thing up your ass, right?
SPIKE	Right.
ANYA	You keep ducking the question.
XANDER	I don't mean to. Anyway, you were the one who didn't want to keep seeing each other.
ANYA	Please, stop this. Just tell me. Are you saying you still love me?
XANDER	Of course I still love you. I always will. I just don't know if that means anything for us anymore.
ANYA	I love you too. And I don't know if that means anything either.
XANDER	Well, it's nice to hear.
ANYA	And, the thing is, I miss you.
XANDER	I'm right here.
ANYA	It's not the same. I miss having you here, in my head. There was always this little part of my brain that was... aware of you, you know? Like, noticing things to tell you later, or wondering what you were doing right then. And that part's all empty now.
XANDER	We could've kept that. I just wasn't ready for marriage, that's all. I didn't want to, you know, get evicted from your head.
ANYA	I was too hurt. I couldn't.
XANDER	I'm sorry.
ANYA	It's okay.
XANDER	Hey, Anya.
ANYA	Yeah?
XANDER	You need anything from me... I'm right here.
XANDER	I'm sorry.
ANYA	It's okay.
XANDER	Hey, Anya.
ANYA	Yeah?
XANDER	You need anything from me... I'm right here.
WOOD	We just spent the day keeping the lid on a riot.
ANDREW	Oooh. That would've been very exciting on tape.
BUFFY	Put down the camera, Andrew. You're not just watching anymore. You're right in the middle of this.
JONATHAN	Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod...
ANDREW	Hey-suus.
JONATHAN	Did you have it again? I had it again!
ANDREW	And that voice... "desme abdo tay deborah" What does it mean? What does it mean ?
JONATHAN	Let's try looking it up again in the morning, in the Dictionario. Holy cow, that was terrifying.
ANDREW	We're fugitives, haunted by our past, tormented by a message we don't understand...
JONATHAN	We're hunted men, driven mad by forces beyond our understanding...
ANDREW	Men of faded power, tortured from within by a voice out of nowhere--
JONATHAN	I don't deserve this. I wasn't even that evil.
ANDREW	I thought you were evil.
JONATHAN	Yeah?
ANDREW	Sure. I respected your ideas for evil projects and I thought you had good follow-through.
JONATHAN	Oh. Well, thanks. It's nice that you noticed.
ANDREW	I don't want to do this anymore. Everyone's staring at me.
WILLOW	Just focus on the charm. You have to focus on the charm to pull the memories out.
WOOD	Tell us about the Seal.
ANDREW	But it tickles and I'm all tense. Can't I have a Zima?
BUFFY	No Zima!
SPIKE	Shut your face about the Zima. Just talk.
XANDER	You were the first person to uncover it and feed it blood. How did you even know it was there? How did you know to do that?
ANDREW	I don't know! Stuff happened. I forget.
KENNEDY	So remember. Look at the charm.
ANDREW	I'm not a part of this. I document. I don't participate. I'm the detached journalist, recording with a neutral eye--
BUFFY	Andrew. Stop it or I smash that camera over your head. Actually, I'm gonna do that either way. You're in this. So talk.
WILLOW	And stop going off topic.
ANDREW	I wasn't off topic. It's gonna get relevant in a second. Because Jonathan's gonna go to the bathroom.
ANDREW	La cucaracha... la cucaracha... la la la la la la-la.
ANDREW	Warren! Oh, gosh, I'm glad to see you.
FIRST	Me too. You're looking good.
ANDREW	Am I? I've prob'ly got pillow creases--
FIRST	No, no. It's good. You're a man on the run. You got a kinda wild and desperate thing going.
ANDREW	Neat. Hey, Warren? I get why Jonathan has to have these dreams, so he'll go back to Sunnydale with me... but how come I have to have 'em too? Couldn't I just tell him I do? They're simply awful.
FIRST	You have to have the dreams. You can't pretend that well. Don't worry about it. You got the knife?
ANDREW	Yeah. It wasn't easy. I had to meet this demon guy who was selling all kinds of weird weapons and stuff--
FIRST	Show me.
ANDREW	Well, I didn't buy them, but there were poison arrows and this sort of collapsible sword...
FIRST	Show me the knife .
ANDREW	Oh, right.
FIRST	Quick, before Shortcakes comes back.
ANDREW	Jonathan? It'll be a while. He's got a shy bladder. Jonathan, you okay?
ANDREW	Pretty knife. Except... the stabbing... I don't think I can do it. Jonathan has been a good friend to me here in Mexico. He said he'll buy me a burro .
FIRST	You can stab him. It's all part of the plan. That boy's blood is a powerful tribute. It's a gift to something very big, very important. And ultimately it won't even hurt him! We get a reward, you and me and him too.
ANDREW	We live as gods.
FIRST	That's right, man. The trio. Livin' as gods.
FIRST	There is power in that knife. Drive the words deep into him. It's the only way for us to get our reward.
ANDREW	Got it. If I kill him with this knife, we will live as gods.
BUFFY	Dawn, search his stuff. Find the knife.
ANDREW	It's not in my stuff. It's in the kitchen. In the cutlery drawer.
XANDER	You put your old murder weapon in with our stuff?
ANDREW	I washed it.
WOOD	Still.
ANDREW	And... I couldn't see it. Didn't want to see it. Didn't want it reminding me.
KENNEDY	Such a sentimental killer.
SPIKE	What're you looking for?
WILLOW	He said The First said something about "words." Like, "drive the words deep into him."
ANDREW	There was carving, on the blade. I just thought it was a pattern.
ANDREW	Whoa. You're right. It's in Tawarick. Or, like, proto-Tawarick. This is really, really old. It says "the blood which I spill I... I consecrate to the oldest evil."
KENNEDY	Creepy. But what's the big?
WOOD	We've never known anything about this Seal. Now we know that this knife and this language is connected to it somehow.
BUFFY	Andrew, can you speak this Tawarick?
ANDREW	Yeah. I'm okay with it--
BUFFY	You're coming with us to the Seal.
DAWN	So he can do what, yell at it in its own language?
WILLOW	Maybe.
WOOD	What? I'm not following.
BUFFY	This Seal already almost caused a riot, and it only took it a day to do it. In a week it'll drive the whole town insane. We've got to do something right now.
WILLOW	And this is the only thing we've got. The Seal responds to this language somehow, or The First wouldn't've needed this knife. Andrew knows the language. There's got to be something there.
BUFFY	Sounds good to me.
SPIKE	Really?
BUFFY	Well, it's better than nothing and we're desperate. Everyone get ready to go.
KENNEDY	So she says "everyone get ready to go." And I'm thinking, great, I'm ready, I've been training. Turns out she's not taking me or my girls. Not even taking Willow. You know who she's taking? The men. And you, Andrew. All the girls get left behind. You wouldn't think Buffy'd play it like that. She's not turning out like I thought she'd be.
KENNEDY	Guess you'd better go. M'lady's calling you.
BUFFY	Remember that riot that almost happened today?
WOOD	Looks to me like it happened after all.
XANDER	Well.
ANYA	Well, well.
XANDER	That was nice.
ANYA	It certainly was, you carpenter you.
XANDER	Too bad Buffy took Spike's chains down.
ANYA	You said it.
XANDER	I felt good.
ANYA	Well, yes. I'm a spitfire in the bedroom. But did it feel... like we used to feel?
XANDER	It was different.
ANYA	I guess we should expect that. We're different now.
XANDER	Yeah. There wasn't that... I don't know...
ANYA	That feeling.
XANDER	Right.
ANYA	Yeah.
XANDER	Does this mean we're really over?
ANYA	I guess it does.
XANDER	Not yet. I don't want it to be over yet. Can't you stay a little longer?
ANYA	So we can do what? Pretend this is still us? Pretend it's not over and we still feel something we don't?
XANDER	Yeah. Pretend that exact thing. Just for a little while.
ANYA	Okay.
SPIKE	Nice way to run a school. There's gotta be kids injured in here.
WOOD	Yeah. Easy pickings for likes of you, huh?
SPIKE	Hey. Here to help, you know.
WOOD	Right.
ANDREW	Check out Spike and the Principal. There's something going on there. Sexual tension you could cut with a knife.
TEEN	Do you belong to us?
BUFFY	Um... what?
TEEN	Are you of the marching band or the swing choir?
ANDREW	I tried out for swing choir once.
BUFFY	We are of the marching band.
SPIKE	These kids went nuts, din't they.
WOOD	Shh. They're still here.
BUFFY	I can hear them. Are they in the classrooms?
WOOD	Ahhh!
ANDREW	Principal Wood!
BUFFY	Robin!
RONA	The thing about Buffy? Is that everything 's about Buffy. She thinks the world revolves around her tiny little body.
AMANDA	She is the Slayer. She's gonna save the world.
RONA	Yep. All by herself. Because she wants it that way.
BUFFY	Spike. Wood. I need you to stay here. Keep the way clear for our retreat.
WOOD	You think more kids'll find us?
SPIKE	They're smelling blood now. They'll find us.
ANDREW	Can I stay with.. . (off her look, to the men) I'll be with Buffy.
BUFFY	Stop it!
ANDREW	But I was just--
BUFFY	No more.
ANDREW	I just want the world to see what you do.
BUFFY	What I do is too important to take the time to show it to the world.
ANDREW	Ooh. I like that.
BUFFY	Be quiet, Andrew. I don't want a biographer. Especially a murderer.
ANDREW	Yeah, well, see, about that? We just keep tossing that word around. But that's not really what happened.
BUFFY	What? You stabbed Jonathan to death! What were you trying to do, scratch his back from the front?
ANDREW	Well, see, it was confusing. Jonathan and I were digging, but Warren was there, and only I could see him...
JONATHAN	But I care about them . That's why I'm doing this.
FIRST	Do it. Stab him.
ANDREW	No. I won't do it.
JONATHAN	What?
FIRST	Do it now !
ANDREW	This isn't right.
FIRST	Stab him. Spill the blood. What's wrong with you, you little coward? JONATHAN Who are you talking to? What isn't right?
FIRST	Stab him! You have to! You'll die a lost soul if you fail and I'll hate you forever! JONATHAN I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
ANDREW	You see, I'm a man, trapped by circumstances into paying for a crime I didn't--
BUFFY	I saw the Seal possess Robin-- Principal Wood earlier. That's what I thought you were going to say.
JONATHAN	...that's why I'm doing this.
ANDREW	Die! Die! Die!
BUFFY	You just completely changed your story!
ANDREW	Did not!
BUFFY	You did so!
ANDREW	Did-- hey look, we're here.
BUFFY	Or we do this.
ANDREW	What...
BUFFY	Does it really make sense? Bringing you here to talk to it? This thing doesn't understand words. It understands blood.
ANDREW	Blood opens it. You don't want to open it. Opening it would be bad.
BUFFY	Well, we looked into that. Seems the blood of the man that awoke it... you... that's a different kind of deal. Reverses the whole thing.
ANDREW	How... how much blood are you gonna...?
BUFFY	I don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.
BUFFY	Stop that! Stop telling stories! Life is not a story!
ANDREW	Sorry, sorry.
BUFFY	Shut up. You always do that, make everything into a story so no one's responsible for anything because it's just like, following some script. Life isn't a story. Life is a bunch of stuff that we choose to do. You're not a tragic hero. You're a guy who killed his friend. And I'm not some--I don't know half as much as you think I do. I'm making it up. And I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we can all come through this thing if we work together, because we can't . People are going to die. Girls. Maybe me. Probably you. Probably right now.
BUFFY	When a river of your blood pours out, Andrew, it might save the world. What do you think of that? Does it make you a world-saver? Does it buy it all back? Are you a hero redeemed?
ANDREW	No.
BUFFY	It didn't want your blood. It wanted your tears.
ANDREW	Thanks.
BUFFY	That's okay. I'm sorry I had to...
WOOD	She got it done.
SPIKE	Always has.
WOOD	So far.

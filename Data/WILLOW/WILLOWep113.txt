We're thinking about heading over to the Bronze. Wanna come and get all unwindy?
It's okay, I checked it out. Janice's Mom is picking her up.
We're not going to have to do that at the wedding, are we? 'Cause there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
Yeah. You know. Some days are harder than the really hard days. It's easier like this, when I'm not alone.
No, that's not -- it's okay. We all know you've been tied up.
With your job. And the slaying -- not like the vamps are going to start staking themselves, huh?
The Funky Monkey claims another victim.
No, it's okay. I don't expect you to stop doing magic just because . . . You don't have to hide it. I'm not - I'm -- I'm doing better. No spells for 32 days. I can even go in the magic shop now. As long as someone's with me. At all time.. But it's better now, it really is. You know, if you were checking on me.
Oh. I haven't seen her since last night. She's not around much these days. We kinda miss her.
Yeah. Of course I will.
What's going on?
Yeah. Okay.
Was she some kind of Zombie?
So that's it. These things just made you think you killed her.
How can you be sure?

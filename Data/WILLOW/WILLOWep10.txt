When did they get divorced?
It must have been harsh.
I can't even imagine it. My parents don't even bicker. Sometimes they glare. Do you know why your folks...
Well, I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with him leaving.
He stills comes down on weekends.
Why is she so Evita-like?
Weighs heavy on the cerebral cortex.
We're doing active listening today.
That would be the homework.
With you.
Buffy. We've been looking for you.
About the spiders. Have you talked to Giles about-
I don't like spiders, okay? Their furry bodies, their sticky webs - what do they need all those legs for anyway? I'll tell you: for crawling across your face in the middle of the night. Ew. How do spiders not ruffle you?
Thank you.
Okay, but we're still caring about the spiders here. Let's not forget the spiders.
Maybe he's in the faculty room.
You know yesterday with the spiders.
Eeeee. You must hate spiders more than I do.
(turning to Wendell) What do you mean you love spiders?
The nightmares.
I'm just saying, Wendell had a dream and then that exact thing happened.
I don't know. Maybe she dreamed about getting beat up. We should ask Buffy when she gets back from the hospital.
Xander, what happened to your...?
Xander kinda found himself in front of our class not wearing much of anything.
Yeah, it was really... ...bad. It was a bad thing.
Everybody staring... I would hate to have everybody paying attention to me like that.
Well, yeah, Xander... it's your nightmare!
Like it happened to Wendell. The thing with the spiders - Wendell had a recurring dream about that.
So why is this happening?
How could he do that?
Faster, but not really safer.
(calls softly) Buffy? Hello, Buffy...? Please show up soon...
I'm not afraid. You'd think I'd be afraid but I'm not.
But... I didn't learn the words...
My turn?
I had to sing. Very bad. To sing.
(shaking off her stupor) What happened to you?
Oh yeah! When the clown chased you and you got so scared that you... had... oh.
But we can't leave without Buffy.
Excuse me, when did they put a cemetery in across the street?
Buffy, your face...
Are you sure everything will go back once he's awake?
Well, how do we wake Billy up? What if we can't?
Whatever it is, it better be soon.
What's he doing?
I'm just glad he's behind bars where he belongs.
Personal question?
When Buffy was a vampire, you weren't still, like, attracted to her, were you?
Still dug her, huh.
Don't I know it.

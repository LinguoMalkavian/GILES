Yeah. No, that's okay. I like it down here. It's... firm.
It's... I'm just a little uneasy with Buffy being out.
Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers-in- waiting to send 'em our way, I expect we'll be seeing more soon enough.
It's starting to get crowded around here. Can't remember the last time I had a bathroom to myself.
Just one and only me. What about you?
Wing? Your house... had wings?
Huh. That's... huh.
No. Safe to say what I practice is definitely old -agey.
A trick?
Yeah, listen, Kennedy... it's almost morning. We really need to get some sleep.
Hello?... No, Giles isn't here right-- Yeah, this is Willow... Althenea, hi! How's the coven? I miss you guys. Still working out that Pleiadian spirit conjuring-- What? Oh... Okay... When?
Word from the underground. Another Potential arrived in town the day before yesterday. She's at the Sunspot Motel, near the highway.
Bringers killed her Watcher before he could tell anyone he sent her. If it wasn't for a particularly powerful seer in the coven, we wouldn't even know about it now.
Bringing another newbie in from the cold.
The more the better, I figure. We need all the help we can get.
What?
Buffy!?
No. The First can only take the form of dead people--
I know. We need a barrier.
I'll try.
Facing my fear... I'm facing my fear... Hear that, fear? I'm facing you...
Just testing.
No. You wouldn't.
Last time I tried a spell... The First... it... had me. Got inside. I felt it. In every fiber of my being. Pure, undiluted evil. I could taste it.
A little chalky.
Caerimonia Minerva, saepio saepire saepsi...
...Saepio impedimentum!
It's-- It's... strong.
I... don't know--
Where is the Turok-Han?
C'mon...
It'll do. Everybody, spread out. Take positions...
And don't make a sound.
Just watch...
Wait.
Yeah. No, that's okay. I like it down here. It's... firm.

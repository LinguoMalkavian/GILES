Take a nap.
Back off.
Gotta fly.
I'm just gonna take a little tour.
Hey, cutie.
Dawny, what are you doing here? 'Cause, if you're looking for me - it's not a great time.
Do I?
No, honey. I am the Magicks.
It's an improvement. Believe me.
Why? So you can run and tell Buffy?
We don't have to talk. Just think real loud - I can hear you.
Don't be like that I'm just a little wired, and have some things to do. I thought if anybody'd understand, it'd be...
You miss her?
Did you cry? Of course you did. I get that, I understand the crying, you cry because you're human. But you weren't always.
No - please, you're telling me you don't remember? You used to be ...what, some mystic ball of energy. Maybe that's why you're crying all the time, "Dawny." You don't belong here.
"Mom!" "Buffy!" "Tara!" Waah! Come on, someone's gotta stop the carnage. It's time you went back to being a little energy ball.
Wasn't gonna hurt her, Buzzkill.
Only the ones in my way...
Doing fine on my own, thanks.
Don't. We're all friends.
Let me tell you something about Willow: she's a loser. And she always has been. Everyone picked on Willow in junior high, high school, up until college with her stupid mousy ways and now - Willow's a junkie.
The only thing Willow was ever good for...
Promise?
Why not?
Ack! Please! This is your pitch? You hate it here as much as I do. I'm just more honest about it.
You're trying to sell me on the world. The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them and you screw a vampire just to feel and insane asylums are the comfy alternative. This world? Buffy, it's me! I know you were happier in the ground - hanging with the worms. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life is when you were dead. Until Willow brought you back.
Sorry. It can be kind of a rough trip if you're, you know - not me.
Jonathan. Andrew. You boys like Magicks, don't you?
Okay, I didn't see that coming.
You want to take it slow? I can do that, too. Ask Warren.
No, no, stay.
Guys... c'mon. I'm getting the wood for the violence here. And you know what they say - if at first you don't succeed...
Damn, that is one effective counter-spell.
(ignoring Buffy) Oh, I get it. You boys put a spell on yourselves, didn't you. On everyone here. Protecting you from harm - from Magicks. That's cute.
How about I back off right after? So which one of you worked the mojo?
(Latin, phonetic) DAH MEE-hee WIM.
Give me Strength .
All right. Now, I'm pretty sure I'm strong enough...
Not a problem.
No!
So. Here we are.
Come on! This is a huge deal for me! Six years as a side man, and now I get to be the Slayer.
Oh, Buffy. You really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked.
Get off, super bitch.
I thought you were gonna show me what a Slayer was.
Can't block my spells if you can't chant. And you can't chant if you're sleepin'...
Buffy, I gotta tell you - I get it now. The Slayer thing really isn't about the violence.

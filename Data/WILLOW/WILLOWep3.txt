Giles didn't approve, huh?
Well, we're behind you.
You were pretending that seeing scantily-clad girls in revealing postures was a spiritual experience.
What is that?
I heard she turned them down.
Hi Amy.
I didn't know you wanted to be a cheerleader. You lost a lot of weight.
Do you know Buffy?
That girl's on fire.
That's all that would have been left of Amber if it hadn't been for Buffy.
That means hacking illegally into the school's computer system -- at last something I can do.
Yeah, you're the Slayer and we're like the slayerettes.
Hi Amy... She okay?
Yeah. Her mom's kinda...
Heil. If she gains an ounce she padlocks the fridge and won't eat anything but broth.
There's a bitter streak -- but Amy's nice. We used to hang in Junior High. When her mom'd go on a broth kick Amy'd come to my house and we'd just stuff ourselves with brownies.
Nothing thrilling. Average student -- got detention once for smoking -- regular smoking, with a cigarette. Not being smoky. All pretty normal.
I told Buffy about Amber.
Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.
Won't know till you ask.
Oh great. I'm a guy.
Xander, alternates are the ones who didn't make the team. They only fill in if something happens to the ones who did.
None.
You're not invisible to Buffy.
-- like a pen that's all chewed up and you know you should throw it away but you don't, not 'cause you really like it that much but more 'cause you're just so used to it and --
Throw away the pen, forget about Buffy. (tosses pen in trash)
I know I'm relieved.
Maybe because... they met her. Did I say that?
Amy.
Cheerleading was kind of her mom's last hurrah.
check out the books on witchcraft!
It'll just take a minute --
Xander ...
"Witches - Historic Roots to Modern Practice" checked out by Alexander Harris.
You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?
That's just mercury and nitric acid, we can get it in the science lab.
One eye of newt...
I do too, then I'd have to carve you up in neat little pieces.
All set. You have a plan?
So it's not her?
Should we talk to her?
We better get her out of there.
It's not her fault --
Buffy --
We gotta get you to --
Buffy?
We gotta get her to a hospital.
How much time do we have?
And if we can't get our hands on it?
We'll go with you.
She must be heading for Buffy!
Amy!
Wait! I needed to talk to you. I can help you.
Well, you know, all your... witchcraft. I know a really good... cauldron... do you actually ride a broom or --
Xander!
Where is she?
It is?

Hi.
What are you doing here?
Buffy, you're sick.
Come on, Buffy. One night of rest isn't going to kill you.
Somebody, please! Now!
Is she going to be okay?
I'll call Giles. Tell him what happened. (then, to Cordelia) Call Buffy's mom. Tell her... not what happened. Just get her here.
I keep telling her that Yoo-Hoo is not a fluid replenisher.
Buffy, what's wrong?
Yeah. It's made her delusional.
What happened?
And she was eight?
Buffy's not here for cosmetic surgery.
Do you think Angel would attack her in here?
That's true...
And, not to be outdone--
Just my way of saying 'Get Well Soon.'
I did all of your assignments. All you have to do is sign your name.
You want me to go real fast? Not that I would...
How?
The Death? As in, 'it is your time?'
Did he have an hourglass?
Your mom did tell us about your cousin...
Okay, where do we start?
I'm sensing less than full committal here.
That's true. But, on the we-live-on- the-Hellmouth side, these kids might have seen a monster.
Unless?
So the kids might be afraid of a regular person. Like the weird doctor.
Let's look him up.
Reprimands for controversial experiments, risky procedures -- a malpractice suit... looks like it was dropped suddenly.
This could be our death guy?
So we checked out Dr. Backer and this guy is not the solid citizen --
You saw it.
She doesn't look well.
Oh, I'm good with medical stuff. Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.
Wrong? Why? How did you play doctor?
It's weird going through his stuff. He didn't finish his coffee. Guess he won't.
I think I got something here.
Okay, this makes sense... Dr. Backer was trying to inoculate kids with a controlled dosage of the same virus they already had. Raising their temperatures to burn the fever out of them.
According to this, it was starting to. So he really was helping the kids.
Thanks.
You will. We will.
You saw it once.
Buffy, think about this.
It's crazy.
But how can you fight this thing when you have a 107 degree temperature?
Buffy!
That's 100% pure. It'll kill you in an instant.
Here. It needs to be diluted.
Hang in there. You'll be okay.
What could've happened?
What?
She's sorry...
Bats! Arrghh! Get them off me! Horrible, horrible bats!
No more bats.
While you're up, could I get a refill?

It just took us to an empty house. She must've moved on already.
We have to go to her.
Got it.
So it's true. Scythe matters.
And you say you sense something when you hold it?
Sounds like maybe some kind of traditional slayer weapon?
Don't worry, Buff. We'll find out everything there is to know.
Okay, before the vineyard was just, you know, a vineyard? It was a monastery. It coulda been put there then. Creepy monks, messing with powers they don't understand...?

No... I don't know... maybe we're coming at this the wrong way. Maybe we need to research the weapon itself. I mean... look... maybe it's the Axe of Dekeron, said to have been forged in Hell itself. Lost since the Children's Crusade, where it killed a lot of... oh... children. I hope that's not it.
It doesn't have any markings. Would it be so hard to include a little sticker? "Hello, my name is the Blank of Blankthuselah, consult operating instructions before wielding."
Gotta say no. Must be a Slayer thing.

I know. And when I was in England I got it. But here... I can't do it. If I tried something big... I just know I'd change and then it's all black hair and veins and lightning bolts. I mean, I can barely do the locator spells without getting dark roots.
Giles, honestly... I don't know.
I guess so.
A who-y?
Yes, absolutely.
Carvings? Like you'd have on a pagan temple?

Hey, workin' lady. Rough night?
No reason. Just figured you were busy with the slayage, 'cause of the grass stains.
"He?"
Ready for a bold suggestion? Blow it off! Dawny and I are heading out to the Bronze.
Very smooth.
Buffy, you sure? Might do you some good to get away from the Doublemeat lifestyle for a night. See your friends.
Thanks. How are Mr. and Mrs. High- strung?
You know when I was little, I used to spend hours imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like. And now that I see them together I just think ...
Can't hide it.
No. Still too soon for so bold a maneuver. But -- if I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me.
Hence the happy. Ooh.
We got your call.
Congratulations. Really. Both of you!
That's the beauty. YOU can't, I can. Please. Let me carry the hate for both of us.
I can't do Magicks.
I got addicted. You know, the way addicts do.
You won't get traced? I don't want to give any bad guys your location by mistake.
Oh. Duh! Of course it is. I keep thinking you're all, like regular people. But you're not.
What a bitch.

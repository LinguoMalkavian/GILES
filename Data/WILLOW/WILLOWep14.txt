No thank you.
Hey, Chris. I was just wondering what you're going to do this year.
Well, every year, you win and I place second. I just thought I'd see what I'm up against.
"The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable?"
Sure, okay. See you, Chris. Thanks for the tip.
This shouldn't take long. I'm probably the only girl in school who has the Coroner's Office bookmarked as a "favorite place."
It's a fruit.
I found it...
Fine... except for being broken.
It says Meredith and two other girls in the car were killed instantly. They were all on the pep squad at Fondren High, on the way to a game.
You mean, making a zombie?
Oh boy, a field trip! Are you gonna call Angel?
I'll pack some food. Who likes those little powdered donuts?
Jealous of what?
'Cause you did that sexy dance with him?
Nope.
Love makes you do the wacky.
Daryl Epps. Chris's older brother. He was a big football star. All-State two years ago. A running... someone that runs and catches.
Big time. All the girls were crazy for him.
He died. Rock climbing, or something. He fell.
He really looked up to his brother. It was tough. Ever since then he's been... real quiet. Kind of in his own world. And I hear his mother doesn't even leave the house anymore.
By the way, are we hoping to find a body, or no body?
Is it an army if you just have three?
Well, so much for the zombie theory.
They probably kept the other parts to eat.
I can think of maybe five or six guys in the science club.
Xander!
Nothing but back issues of "Scientific American." Ooh, I haven't read this one.
"Gray's Anatomy", "Mortician's Desk Reference", "Robicheaux's Guide to Muscles and Tendons".
And for Eric the unattainable would include everyone. That's alive.
I don't know. The thing with his brother was really hard on him; He talked a lot about death. Maybe he just wants to get one up on it.
If it is, my science project's definitely coming in second this year.
We were talking about the reanimation of dead tissue.
I still don't get how Chris could do it. Arresting the cell deterioration is one thing, but...
Maybe an electrical current combined with an adrenaline boost...
Maybe they finished their project.
And what are they... going to do with her?
So they don't have the whole, uh, package.
One step...
Well, I've checked the obits. Nothing that would make for a likely candidate.
Formaldahyde.
A couple days and they're useless. They're gonna need something really fresh.
As fresh as possible... Buffy, you don't think they'd...
Buffy, don't be too hard on Chris. I mean, he's not a vampire...
Buffy get back yet?
Eric's was a bust. Nothing there.
All the time.
Wondering why we never seem to have dates.
No thank you.

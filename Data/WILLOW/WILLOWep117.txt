Hi, um... Tara. How are you? I was wondering... do you want to go out sometime? For coffee? Or food? Or kisses and gay love?
Plus, I'd visit you at work every single day.
I was online. Checking to see if Xander e-mailed.
No such. I mean, I get the deal: that special I-left-a-girl-at-the altar feeling -- I'm sure he needs some alone-time. But, still...
Saw her. Saw her completely.
It's, when I was seeing her, she was seeing someone else. A girl
Not seeing seeing a girl, well, maybe. I don't know. It was inconclusive, and I didn't stick around to find Out. Might've magicked my fist through a wall or something.
They're prob'ly just friends. I press my lips against my friends all the time.
Thanks, Buff.
Xander! You're here!
Oh. No. You want to find her?
She left a couple days ago.
You mean between the sobs? There was mostly just wheezing.
So, you left her at the altar but... you still want...?
Okay, okay. Calm now. Let's turn around and release our very manly... thing... the other way.
Xander...
Buffy? Are you okay?
I don't know.
C'mon, Xander. Help me get her home.
Since when?
For higher learning?
Did it hurt? The, uh, hallucination?
Okay! All in favor of research?
Buffy, good news. I found the demon. Fits your description and symptoms perfectly. Look, is this it?
I know. You're confused, but it's just that crazy juice inside you.
We've all been kinda slumming.
No. Buffy look at me. You're not in an institution. You've never been in an institution.
What?
You never said anything.
God. That's horrible.
Buffy, you're not. I'm so sorry you had to go through that, but it's in the past. You have to trust me. We're gonna get you that antidote.
It's okay. We got help.
I need its arm.
Ready?
Xander, go to the magic shop. We'll need Alkanet Root and a handful of Nettle Leaf. Just for their medicinal properties. No magic. When you got them, meet me at the campus lab. I'll see if I can brew up an antidote the old fashioned way.
Fine. Xander, let's go.
Buffy.
It took a little longer than I'd hoped. No magic and all. It went boom twice, but then I got it.
Make sure she drinks that. I want to let Dawn know everything's going to be okay.
Ooh. Buffy. Didn't see you there.
No more Cookoo's Nest?
I can make you some food. Something big with energy to help clear your noggin. C'mon.
NO!! Tara!
LET HER GO!!!
Buffy.
Buffy, sit. You'll fall over.
Okay. We'll make more. We'll take care of it.

Hard to believe it's the fumigation party already . . .
It's an annual tradition, the closing of the Bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches.
It's a lot of fun. What's it like where you are?
Things and stuff. So we're talking about a guy.
You lack a guy?
What about Angel?
He doesn't stay around much, it's true.
Oh yeah.
Just sitting here watching our barren lives pass us by. Oh look, a cockroach.
Don't go . . .
Want a free drink?
That is so romantic.
Wow. Did you, uh, I mean did he, uh . . .
How is it you always know this stuff? You always know what's going on -- I never know what's going on.
No, I was sleeping.
Angel's a vampire?
So that's a no, huh?
Oh boy, time for geometry. (off Xander and Buffy's looks) It's fun if you make it fun.
Geometry's starting.
But you're out here drinking.
Something's bothering you. Buffy.
Cause you kinda got a thing there and she kinda has a thing . . . elsewhere.
She doesn't like him 'cause he's a vampire, I know she's not down with that part.
That's the dance.
Gee, what's that like?
That must have been so embarrassing when you thought he'd read your diary but then he hadn't but then it turned out he felt the same way that -- -- I'm listening.
So Angel's been around for a while.
So he is a good vampire. I mean on a scale of one to ten, ten being someone who's out there killing and maiming every night and one being someone who's . . . not . . .
Okay, so Reconstruction began, when? Buffy?
After the destruction of the Civil War.
Are we going to talk about boys or are we going to help you pass history? Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander is going to just grab me and kiss me, right on the lips.
No, no, no. No speaking up. That way leads to madness and sweaty palms.
Okay, here's something I gotta know: when Angel kissed you, I mean before he turned into . . . how was it?
Wow. And it is kind of novel how he'll stay young and handsome forever -- although you'll still get wrinkly and die -- oooo, and what about the children -- I'll be quiet now.
So you can . . .?
The era of congressional Reconstruction, usually called Radical Reconstruction, lasted ten years . . .
What happened?
If you care about somebody . . . . . . you care about them. You can't change that just by --
Buffy's mom is asking for you.
We're near the Bronze, what now?
Buffy, it wasn't Angel who attacked your mom, it was Darla!
No word from Angel?
Well, in a way, he is. In the way of that he's right over there.
Nothing.

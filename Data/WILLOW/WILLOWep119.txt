When did morning happen?
Mmm. I forgot how good this could feel. Us. Together. Without the magic.
It's getting late.
No. God, no. I was just thinking about Buffy.
I didn't hear her. She wouldn't talk about what happened at the magic shop when she got home last night. She just wanted to know how close I got to tracing the camera signal back to the Empire of the Nerds. And then she left again.
I'm not worried about her going up against Warren and the others. I know this is going to sound crazy, but... I think there might be something going on. With Buffy and Spike.
She looked so hurt when she saw him with Anya. I think maybe --
I don't know if I'd go that far.
They're sleeping together? The naked kind of together?
Does everyone else know? Am I the only one she didn't --
How could she hide something like that from me?
No, I'm not -- I'm just trying to understand.
She probably really needs someone to talk to.
Buffy?
Not yet. But I'm sure she'll be back soon. Everything's fine. Go back to bed.
Oh, umm...
(surprised, hurt) She told you about Spike?
(totally not) Yeah, I totally knew.
It's gonna be all right. It's just... complicated. When people have such strong feelings for each other, sometimes they --
We're here! Ready for action -- uh, bad guy fighting action.
No, we're good.
(not listening) Super...
Okay. We'll stop.
We should go back. Tara and I could Sherlock around and --
Should we call Xander?
Sure. We'll decipher codes and foil evil schemes and --
I was with you up until there.
One of their data CDs. It's filled with encrypted blueprints, schematics...
I'm not sure. Their designations have been stripped.
Would that involve getting up?
Then I'm coming out firmly against it.
Kinda busy working on my own...
Hey, I think we finally got something --
We were able to decipher pretty much everything except these.
It was filled with encoded blueprints and schematics.
They're looking to score some serious dinero. I don't think they're planning just one job.
You don't have to. There's one here we think they'll hit tonight.
Hey. Clothes.
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, not quite the response I was fishing for.
Think they're making up?
Tara?

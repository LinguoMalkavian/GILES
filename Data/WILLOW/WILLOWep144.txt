Did you find out anything about the scythe?
Well all right!
Whoa hey, not to poop on the party, but I'm the guy who's gonna have to pull this off.
Not to careen back to the me subject, but... I'm... this is beyond anything I've ever done. This is a total loss of control, and not in a nice, wholesome, my-girl-friend-has-a- pierced-tongue way.
I'm just not sure I'm stable enough to --
I'm gonna need to run an energy scan on that puppy. To start with.
I really wish she hadn't said that about me.
Ehheh.
You may have to keep me stabbed... if I go to the bad place.
I am.
I will. I mean, I do. Mean it. If I go south, you gotta protect the others.
The darkest place I've ever been -- this is what lies beyond that. This is too important for me to...
You know, Buffy: Sweet girl, not that bright.

Thanks.
Nothing strenuous...

They should be in place. Okay. Magic time. You ready to... heh heh... kill me?
Great. Pun. Right. Brace yourself.
Oh...
And you're a Slayer.
I didn't do that...
We changed the world. I can feel them, Buffy. All over. There are Slayers awakening everywhere.
We will.
You got my vote.
Yeah, the First is scrunched, so... What do you think we should do, Buffy?

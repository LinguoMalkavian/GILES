I've just got a few more to do. I'll hang for a bit.
Xander, you want to stay and help me?
Yes, it was a joke I made up.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Buffy! I didn't even see you.
Oh, I was... I was talking.
Why not?
Well... I sort of met someone.
Last week. Right after we did the scanning project in the Library.
No, Malcolm, no, and very nice.
Well, I wasn't sure there was anything to tell. But last night -- oh, we talked all night. It was amazing. He's so smart, Buffy, and he's romantic and we agree about everything.
I don't know.
I met him on line.
It's him...
He's so sweet.
What should I write back?
"I'm thinking of you too!" No, that's incredibly stupid.
See, I knew you'd react like this.
Buffy --
His name is Malcolm Black, he's eighteen, he lives in Elmwood which is like eighty miles from here and he likes me.
Why does everything have to be about looks?
Well... no. He doesn't talk like the kind of person who has a hairy back. And anyway that stuff doesn't matter if you really care about each other. (a little vulnerable) Maybe I'm not his ideal of babelitude either.
Xander.
Xander.
Not me. I think I'm gonna make it an early night.
That's nice. Have a good time.
I overslept.
Yeah. What.
You're having an expression.
Not like me to have a boyfriend?
Malcolm and I really care about each other. Big deal if I blow off a couple of classes.
Malcolm said you wouldn't understand.
I know what you mean. I feel like you know me better than anyone.
Do you think we should... (hesitates before saying\ typing) ... meet?
I'm nervous.
That's what Buffy doesn't understand. How comfortable you can make me feel.
How did you know that?
I guess.
I have to sign off. I'll talk to you later.
Mom? Dad?
Dad, did you forget your keys again?
"Finally see me?" Malcolm...?
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
Why?
By lying to me. By pretending to be a person. Pretending... that you loved me.
You're evil.
What are you doing?
Let me leave.
Don't say that! That's a joke. You don't love anything.
I'm not yours. I'm never gonna be yours. I hate you.
Buffy!
Remember me? Your girlfriend?
I'm thinking we should break up.
But maybe we can still be friends.
I'm sorry, guys. I'm just thinking about...
Malcolm, Moloch, whatever he's called. The one boy that's really liked me and he's a demon robot. What does that say about me?
But I thought -- I mean I was really falling --
That's true...
Yeah!

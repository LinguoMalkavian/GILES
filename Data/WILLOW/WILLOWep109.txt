Aw, whatsa matter, Amy? You lonely? We gotta get you a nice companion rat that you can love and play with and grow attached to 'til it leaves you for no good reason. Won't that be fun?
Reveal!
What was is no longer. What was done, undo. The danger passed, the trial no more, set it right.
Hey, here's some hot chocolate, you want --
Okay, maybe later. How're you --
Amy. Three things we have to talk about. One, Larry's gay. Two, Larry's dead. Three, high school's... kind of over.
Listen, why don't you have some --
Oh. Um ...okay.
Yeah. Not parades and cotton candy, but okay.
Of course
Uh-huh.
I know.
Dunno. She's kinda freaked out, but I would be, too.
I know. I just ...realized I could. I thought of the right thing and ...
Here. Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
Everything slowed down, nervous system, circulatory system. He's still unconscious.
It's okay. No one freak. We'll just do this another way.
It's quicker. It'll just take a sec to go through the files.
Well, let's do some more checking, shall we?
Guys, I'm fine, really. What's the deal with --
Guys, it's okay. It's hard, but -- but it's better this way, believe me. Little things started taking over, things that don't matter, but we saw them differently, and so they got blown out of proportion.

Amy...?
I wasn't, I mean, I thought I was --
Don't you wanna go see your dad or --
About where you were.
Well, hey, I can help you with that. Only, you might wanna, like, sew your name in your clothes first or something.
Well...
Well... whaddya wanna do?
No. No, you know what? I can have fun. Heck, I deserve some fun.
I can party. Not like I owe anyone anything, I'm totally free. So, let's go make with the fun.
I know. Xander engaged. I couldn't believe it either.
Thousand year old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit-phobia.
Hey.
Oh, uh, no. You go ahead. I'll keep an eye on the drinks.
No, really, I'm --
Willow. Nice, um, dress. Thanks, but -- no.
Yeah, it's not -- she's not -- I'm still...
Yeah, go. I'm all kinds of good.
No use looking at me like that. It's the gullet for you, mister.
No, s'okay.
I think she said no.
Gee.
Hmmmm. Me too.
You know, this music --it's not quite...
We've kind of played this scene.
Return.
So... should we go?
What?
Done yet?
I know! Me too!
Heck yeah.
We can still do a little more.
I do so love the trouble.
Listen, why don't you have some --
Oh. Um ...okay.
Yeah. Not parades and cotton candy, but okay.

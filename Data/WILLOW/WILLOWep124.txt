Yes! My fear's a big obnoxious blabbermouth - and you're the one who keeps telling me to trust my instincts.
So? Shouldn't we be listening? I don't want to go back home just so I can screw up again. Why don't I stay? Not forever, just long enough to, I dunno, make my fear shut up a little, maybe.
Ho. Well. For starters? How about the Hellmouth's getting all rumbly again and now I know it's got teeth and are those literal teeth 'cause I don't know if I can handle it, and what if I can handle it? Does that mean I have to be a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness? What if I have to give up all this control stuff and go all veiny and homicidal and what if ...
A-huh?
Well ... sure. I mean you put it that way - duh .
That all you got?
Okay. Guess I'd better ...

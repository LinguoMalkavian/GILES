Buffy!
Oh my God. Dawn, what happened here? What--?
Let me see. Make sure--
What?
Oh, Sweetie...
It wasn't her.
At least, I don't think it... I saw something, too. And it looked like... Someone else. But it wasn't...
It's the bad thing, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
I-I don't know, Dawn. I'm just not sure we can trust anything right--
She's here. She's okay. She's not hurt. Just exhausted. Finally fell off to sleep.
Hell happened? This Big Evil that keeps promising to devour us? I think it started chomping.
Both of us. Buffy... this thing knows us. Made us think we were talking to people we knew. Mine said it came with a message from Tara, but Dawn actually saw...
Your mother.
Buff. This thing. It had me for a while. Before letting loose with all the, you know, pulse-pounding terror. But before that, the lies were very... convincing. It seemed real.
Well... That's impossible, right? It's another fake-out, you got one, too. Wasn't a real vamp--
Buffy, do you really think Spike is--?
Maybe.
Just because those weren't the spirits of, you know, our people... just because they were some evil thing, it doesn't mean what they said can't be true.
No.
I mean, no, there's not really an increase in neck injuries, but...
Missing people. Maybe eight, oh, ten of 'em. No bodies, they're just... missing, mostly young, lotsa girls...
Buffy, he's been feeding. On human blood. That's gonna do stuff...
Something like what talked to us?
So if you want to understand it-
Let me see. Make sure--

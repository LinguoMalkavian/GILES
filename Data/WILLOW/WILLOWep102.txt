X-Xander... Where--?
Why... Why are-- Where's Tara?
Moving. (starting to remember) Oh. Right. Demons. On bikes.
Buffy! The ritual! We have to go back!
We need to try again.
We have to, Xander! She's ... She's waiting, counting on us. On me. I can't leave her there anymore. I won't. We have to finish--
Osiris.
Broken. It's broken. I remember.
There is no other one.
No. It's no good. The urn's defiled. It's gone. Nothing.
Um, Xander, that's not the North Star. It's an airplane.
Xander... I can't walk anymore. I have to rest.
You said that an hour ago. I'm just ... The spell took a lot out of me.
Don't. Not now.
Doesn't make any difference now...
I'm not avoidy. We've got bigger problems. Demons.
And we're lost. So can we just-
That light.
(calling out) Hello?
No. Too small--
Xander, I don't think--
Oh. It's just--
Xander...
It's not a bug.
It's Tara.
Not yet. (a weak smile) But I will be.
We have to go out and look for them.
Well, yeah. Unless someone's got a better idea.
Buffy... (then, with painful resignation) ... is not coming back. We failed.
It would've worked.
What?
You mean maybe it's my fault.
Buffy?
Buffy... Buffy, are you...? It's Willow. Can you hear me?
(almost defensively) Nothing. She's ... she's in shock.
What?
Xander?!
oh... God...
You'd be wrong.
Look. We don't want trouble. And you don't want trouble.
Not this kind.
Buffy!
I don't know... I ...
Obfuscate!
Fragilis!
(choking out) T-Tara?
(looking off) Buffy.

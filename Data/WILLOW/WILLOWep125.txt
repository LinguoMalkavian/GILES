Welcome home, me.
Hello?
Dawn? Did I hear the door?
Yes, hello. I'm calling for Giles-- Mister Giles... Right... the Council all day... No, I know he can't be reached there. Thanks. Bye.
Anya!
I just got back.
Neither. But I have been studying. Working really hard. I'm going to be fine.
I want to help any way I can with that. I feel really responsible.
I know I hurt you. And everyone. I'm sorry.
Go on. Say whatever you want. Rib- bones and so forth. I deserve it.
No.
Sorry.
And... the others? Dawn and Xander and Buffy? Do you know where they are?
Not so much.
That sounds great. So where do you think they'd be?
Spike's what in the whatment?
Xander?
Ahh!
Spike! My... God, Spike. Anya said-- What happened to you?
I don't--
I did. I needed to go. But I'm back and I just found... there's a body...
Um, yeah. And I can't find Buffy or Xander or Dawn and now there's something killing people. The victim was skinned. What would do that?
Anything other than... other than me?
What kinds of things? I have to know. Is there anything else that could have done this?
Spike?
What you did? You didn't do this. Did you?
Please, try to listen to me...
Spike. I'm... I'm sorry about whatever... but I think I should go.
I need help.
I don't want money!
I found a dead body near the high school.
Something horrible killed a boy, Anya. Took his skin off.
No! ANYA No!
Yeah. Maybe she already does. I don't know. I just... I need to find whatever really did it. Because I need to do something right.
I... I don't.. when did you get all insightful?
So... will you help me?
I'd be shocked. Okay. You have your powder?
We scatter it over the map, and everywhere there's a demon, it makes a little light.
No.
Oooo.
The high school. It's all Hellmouthy underneath.
Smoke!
That could be it. It's strong. It's near the body, and it's by itself. Hiding in the woods, or a cave - couple good caves 'round there...
That's why you teleport over there real quick like a bunn- - real quick, and see if I'm right.
Anya! It would take, like, a millisecond.
You're a Vengeance Demon. Teleport.
Wow. I'm sorry. That must be hard.
Really? Because I got the impression you enjoyed, you know, inflicting.
Is it like, you're scared of losing that feeling again, and having it be okay to hurt people and then you're not in charge of the power anymore because it's in charge of you?
I get it. Believe me.
You too.
I have to go find this monster.
I did. I tried. But something went gaflooey and it didn't work.
It said they don't exist.
What's going on? Who's here?
Protect me, Goddess. In thy name I supplicate myself. Take the powers from my enemy and lay him lower than the lowest field--
Maybe you're immune to magic, but I got more than that! You wanna fight?
Stop it.
Were they here? Were my friends really here? I heard something--
They... wouldn't leave... they'll return...
No. No. No.
Wht's gng on?
I... I dn't see...
Someone came. Zey din't leav me.
Zr here, zr here. Nt alone...
I can move...
...couldn't find you and I looked everywhere... And the monster said you left me... Oh! There you are! There you are!
I know! You're here!
Buffy.
That's all I had left in me anyway.
I'm healing. Growing new skin.
It's magic. I'm drawing power from the earth to heal myself.
Ultimately, everything is part of the earth. The bed, the air, us.
Plus you stuck your thumbs in a demon.
No. Please. Stay. I missed you so much when I couldn't find you.
I did it.
I think so. No, not a spell. I just remember thinking that I wasn't ready to see you guys, and I was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.
Yeah. I think so.
It's nice to be forgiven. Too bad I need so much of it.
I know.
He did, a little. Heck, I did, a little. Xander has the luxury of not saying it. But you're the Slayer. You have to say stuff like that. It's okay. It's okay, too, if you still don't think I can recover from this magic thing. Because, honestly, I'm not that sure about that either.
It hurts too much not to try.
It just takes so much strength. I don't have that much.
Are you sure...
Much.

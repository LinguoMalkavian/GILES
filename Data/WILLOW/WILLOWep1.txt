Really?
Which part?
Well, what’s in it for me?
Okay. Do you have “Theories in Trig?” You should check it out.
From the library. Where the books live.
I heard someone was transferring here.
Well my Mom picked it out.
Oh.
Why? I mean Hi. Did you want me to move?
But aren’t you… hanging with Cordelia?
Not legally.
Oh, I could totally help you out! If you have sixth period free we could meet in the library –
It has that effect on most kids. I love it, though. It’s a great collection, and the new librarian’s really cool.
Yeah, he just started. He was a curator of some British Museum. Or the British museum, I’m not sure. But he knows everything and he brought all these historical volumes and biographies and am I the single dullest person alive?
Buffy, this is Jesse, and that’s Xander.
She’s not hanging out with us.
What are you talking about?
Oh, hi! Hi.
No, I’m just here. I thought Xander was gonna show up…
No. We’re just friends. We used to go out, but we broke up.
He stole my barbie. We were five.
I don’t actually date a whole lot… lately.
Well, when I’m with a boy I like, it’s hard for me to say anything cool, or witty, or at all… I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.
It’s probably easy for you.
I mean, you don’t seem too shy.
I do.
Life is short.
Oh… That’s nice…
That’s okay. You don’t have to come back.
Seize the moment…
Sure is dark…
That’s a dark time. Night. Traditionally.
I still can’t believe I’ve never seen you at school. Do you have Mr. Chomsky for History.
The ice cream bar’s down this way – it’s past Hamilton street.
Okay, this is nice and… scary… Are you sure this is faster?
No thank you.
That wasn’t funny.
I think I’m gonna go.
Jesse!
Jesse, let’s get out of here.
Leave us alone.
We’ll get the police – it’s just a few blocks up –

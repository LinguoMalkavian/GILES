Hey?
Ha...
Is that like a dream joke thing? You're sorry to wake me, but I'm clearly not awake and if I was awake and you really were here, would you be sorry to wake me up? I mean, after all this time and - Oh God, I'm babbling. I'm dream babbling and it's the best dream of my life and I'm wasting it and-
Oh.
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to-
Wait! Don't! Don't leave-
Oh. So we'll just sit. We'll sit here. And if the dream, or possibly ghosty, rules are no touching, that's fine. Just don't go. Okay?
I think I'm kind of hyperventilating.
No, it's okay. Just...
It hurts so much. I miss you so much.
I keep telling myself, better to have loved, right? And lost? Like, at least we had that. But sometimes I wish...
It's not okay! It's so much worse now. Like, you filled my life up. You made it bigger. And when you... The hole you left is so deep. I'm never going to fill it up. I'm never going to...
How? You're gone.
Big snotty weepy Amazon.
I don't know... I don't know where to start. (with difficulty) Tara. After Warren shot you. I had a very... dramatic reaction. I killed him. I mean, really, really killed him. And then...
You do? There's gossip where you are?
It was horrible. I was horrible. I lost myself. The regular me.
A lot of people grieve. They don't make with the flaying. I hurt so many people. All my friends. Buffy, Xander, Giles... I didn't care. I wanted to erase them all. I wanted to erase the whole world.
But I am the power. It's in me. Did I mention random destruction of property? The magic box is... not so much a box now-
I know. You were right-
Black magic. Of course. But Giles says it isn't as simple as quitting it all cold turkey. He says I have to learn to use my power for good. The magic is in me now, and if I try to repress it, it's going to end up coming out again - in a bad way.
I don't want to. I can't. But the stuff Giles and the coven taught me in England - it helped. And, you know, all I have to do is think of the look on Dawnie's face - when I tried to... When I said such awful things to her. I never want to see that look again. I never want to cause that kind of pain.
So I won't. I'm going to be okay.
I'm going to... what?
How do you know? What do you know?
Oh God...
Right. Right. Stop. But what about Giles? He made it seem like it would be just as dangerous for me to quit completely. Like I'll go off the deep end again.
I tried to stop. I tried. What if I can't do this?
How can I not ? You're telling me I'm going to murder all my friends! I'm not strong, Tara. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me. Look what I did before...
What? Anything.
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
Stop-
Stop. Stop using Tara this way-
From beneath you it devours.

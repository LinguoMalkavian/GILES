All I'm saying is you might want to rethink the stereotype before someone turns you into a toad.
If I see one more idiot that thinks witches are all hairy moles and rotten teeth...
Aw, look at you! Aren't you just the cutest little thing!
I know, but -- look, with the nose and the hat and -- aww! Come on. Let's fill that tummy up with sugary nibblets!
Or I could whip up a jaunty self- cleaning incantation. It'll be just like Fantasia.
Think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse.
That's -- that's... wow.
Why wait?
Karzaritate tamae. WILLOW Adorn with happiness.
Why bother? These are perfect -- and extra biodegradeably. In a couple of hours -- poof!
You can also fight monsters "naturally" with sticks and stones. Don't really recommend it, though.
How?
Which makes them happy. Like pretty decorations made Anya happy.
Why are you being like this?
This is so about you. You're always coming down on me for doing magic that couldn't hurt a fly. What's your problem?
It's okay. We're done.
And that's why we told her she couldn't.
Hey, we were just gettin' our funk on.
Just typical teen stuff. I'm sure she's fine. Not like there's a Hellgod out there trying to drain her blood this time, right?
Do they know they're brother and sister?
What?
It's where I'd be if I were sixteen and on the lam.
Well, not me at sixteen, 'cause, hello -- spaz.
Hard to believe such a hot mama yama came from such humble, bad hat- wearing, geek-infested roots.
I have to try?
No, there's too many people.
It'll take too long.
I'm just going to clear the crowd.
I'll shift everyone that's not a sixteen-year-old girl into an alternate dimension.
It'll just be for a fraction of a second. They won't even notice.
Why?
It won't.
Sukut! WILLOW (English translation) Quiet!
So you're taking his side now?
Have you two been talking about me behind my back?
You know how that makes me feel?
That'd be a good start.
Tara --
So, big monster mashing. Sorry we missed it.
Yeah, I mean that's --
Tara . . .
I'm sorry. Okay?
What do you want me to do? Reverse time and take it back? 'Cause I might be able to if I --
Okay.
Let's just forget about it.
(softly, in Latin) Obliviscere. WILLOW (English translation) Forget.
Better warm me up.
So. . . you're not mad?

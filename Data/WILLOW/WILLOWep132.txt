Yeah, my searches aren't turning anything up either. Are you sure this thing called itself The First?
Here's something!
I feel it. It's still in me...
I don't want to hurt anybody, Buffy. Don't let it make me. Oh, God...
I can't. I can't. I'm sorry...
We haven't been able to find anything on The First. No documentation.

Our "ghosts."
Annabelle can sleep here, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room-
Okay, then Molly down here, you with Dawn and Annabelle with me.
You want to do the sleeping arrangements?
What? Huh? She's - she's new.
Or we can order a pizza.
Xander? Newbies. Let's ease them into the whole "jokes in the face of death" thing.
Okay or even better. It's like our guarantee. Um, Buffy...?
Okay, I can't do everything, but I should be able to do something. I have so much power. But when I try to use it...
Okay.

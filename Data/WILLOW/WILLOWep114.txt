Slugs?
Oh.
Oh, yeah, of course, she should totally be there, it'll be great!
What, me? Of course, why wouldn't I be? It'll be fun, I'll be fine.
No.
Guys, Tara's Buffy's friend, too, she should be there. I want her there, it'll be good to see her.
Hey, Dawnie. Buffy out patrolling already?
Oh, honey, I would, but I've got group. You know. The whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing. We're looking for a better name.
Sorry. I think it's just one of those nights, you know?
You okay going on your own?
Hey.
Hey. How are you?
Great. I mean, fine. You know. All Finey McFine Fine.
Thanks!
Thanks. You too Is that a new --
It's nice.
Great! Good! You should, don't wanna get, you know. Thirsty.
See? It's a battery-operated back massager, only it's portable, so you can take it with you on patrol.
It's like instant gratification for all your little acheys.
Okay, it's just a beer run. I'll go.
Perfect. Here we go with the beer- getting.
Wait, does everyone know who they are? Just figure it's a good idea to check.
Oh. Hi.
No, me either. I mean, it's weird. I have class, I know I should go.
Exactly!
Yeah, see if anyone else...
What if we just, like, as a group, get up right now and throw ourselves at the door?
We're not accusing you of anything. Just seems like you were taking it kinda personal down there.
You're sure?
Actually... not everything.
It won't take long.
I can't.
You don't know how much I hate this. I don't even know if there's anything I could do.
It's dangerous.
No, I can't. If I start, I may not be able to stop.
Thanks. For before. And for taking all this stuff with you.
Just so you know, I was never gonna use it. I mean, not really. I only kept it like a safety net.
Yeah, kind of.

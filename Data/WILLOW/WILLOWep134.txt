Buffy. We just got news.
Positive. Althenea says the seers definitely located another Potential Slayer here in Sunnydale. Someone who already lives here.
No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just need to get together a few ingredients. You shouldn't skip your training, it's too important.
To light the aura of the new: Skin of snake and chrysalis too.
The smell will lead us to the Potential.
She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura.
Um... I'm not sure. I don't think so...
I suck. I'm sorry, you guys. Maybe we can figure out something on the computer.
I think it worked.
Dawnie, are you okay?
I did it right.
A Slayer. It makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about how they have the same blood or whatever?
We need to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited.
Well, I guess Buffy trains you--
It's okay. We'll protect you.
We'll tell her the minute she gets home.
What? Dawnie, she has to know.
Dawn--
Of course she will!
It's not like that. It's like... she's part of this huge power. I know what that feels like. It's wonderful.
We don't know that!
...and we don't know what she meant about Buffy--
C'mon sweetie, open up.
I can do a locator spell. But we gotta hurry.

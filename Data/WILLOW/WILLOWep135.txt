Still flu-ey. Bummed about missing the field trip. She wants you to meditate extra hard for her. And maybe bring her back s'mores.
Hey. How is he?
There seems to be a definite lack of screaming, that has to be good.
Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.
It's just tea.
Spike's chip? Only the stuff I could dig up that hadn't been buried by The Initiative. So, you know. About zero. Why?
You think this is chip-related? Buffy, did he try to --
The chip is misfiring all on its own then.
No.
Okay, not when you make it sound all dirty like that.
Hey, I figured the best thing for a cold was probably a nice, hot cup of... boots.
For someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust. And casual- dressy.
You were never sick.
Oh! You are so busted, Xander's gonna hafta drive you to the desert now --
What...
This is a mission?
And, I guess the little paper umbrellas in the drinks are, what, a signal for... we're not on a mission, are we?
No, this is a fun thing, I've done this thing!
Why do you do that?
I will stay for one drink. Just to keep you company. Then I'm going home.
Wait, wait, that's easy? And, hey, you just assume that I'm... that I'm gay? I mean, presume much?
Hey! What do you think, you have some kind of, like, special lesbi-dar or something?
I just... what, can you always tell? Just from looking at someone?
Three years ago. That's when I knew. And it wasn't women. It was woman. Just one.
You were five.
No, it's just... I still can't figure it out. Why you... like me. You don't even know me.
No! I --
I don't like any of those things. Except the fighting evil part. And even then I'd prefer a nice foot massage.
Did your parents freak out?
Yeah. My mom was all proud, 'cause she thought I was making a political statement. Then the statement mojo wore off, and I was just gay... she hardly ever even met Tara.
I didn't mind. Tara and I are sort of... private.
Were, I mean. Private.
Well. This is my stop.
Totally. Air, cleared. Check.
Yeah?
Oh. Is something...
Okay, you all right? Not used to literally knocking girls off their feet with just the power of my lips.
Is this another freckle thing, 'cause --
It's the man I killed.
Guys.
What? No, I'm not The First --
I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on. Ask Kennedy, she was there.
Okay, no! Don't ask Kennedy. Wrong. No Kennedy-asking. Let's try another approach...
No, I'm not. It's . Not. I'm not it! Listen to me --
I'm not The First.
I'm not The First!
I'm not The First!
I know!!!
Hey! Bad touching.
I'm Willow.
You know, there are other stories from kindergarten, non-yellow-crayon stories, in which you don't come out in such a good light. An incident involving Aquaman Underoos, for example. Want me to start talkin'?
I don't know. We were... we were there. And then I looked like him.
Maybe. I probably brought it on myself.
Wouldn't be the first time. I kinda have a history with my witchy subconscious making things go kerfloofy. Remember the wacky "I can't see you, you can't see me" spell? Hijinks ensued.
All too aware.
Well, obviously because I... feel bad. About... killing him.
No. I can handle this.
I did it. I'll fix it. And I don't want you seeing me this way.
Seriously, I'm not posing any big threat to the world. And it looks like you've got your hands full already.
Kennedy, go home.
I killed him. It's hard to see the chuckles.
Yup. Gonna get some help reversing it.
I did try. Didn't work. Something's... blocking me.
I really think I'm fine with the handling.
Well, see above re; I'm the one who killed him.
Fine. Come.
To find some old friends of mine. Been awhile, but maybe they can help.
Okay, that's new.
Oh. Hey. I'm sorry. Willow. We actually met when I was a freshman. And, also, not a boy. This is Kennedy.
Yeah.
Okay, whoa.
I got hit with this, like, glamour. And I can't seem to shake it myself.
Oh.
Aaaauuugghh!!
No, it didn't, you dumb bitch.
No. I, I didn't. It wasn't me.
Upset? Upset ?!? Are you just tuning in, did you not see that? I'm turning into him. It's not a trick, it's not a glamour, I'm becoming him. A murderous, misogynist man . Do you understand what he did? What I could do? I killed him for a reason .
You understand nothing about magic. And in case you didn't notice, our "date" is over.
Look at me. Crying like a girl.
You'd be amazed.
You think you can just do that to me? That I'd let you get away with it?
It's too late, this is what I am. I made it happen, I'll make it stop.
You were there, bitch, you saw it! I killed her!
Him! Her! You know what I mean...
No. That was Warren --
It was your fault. Slut. You tricked me, got me to forget.
Shut up! Shut! Up! You do not get to say her name! Offering it up to whoever's there. Tricking me into kissing you...
No, she was never gone, she was with me, we should have been forever... and I... I let her be dead. She's really dead.
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry... don't leave me again, baby, come back, I'm sorry, come back.
What are you doing?
It's me? I'm back?
I have no idea.
Still flu-ey. Bummed about missing the field trip. She wants you to meditate extra hard for her. And maybe bring her back s'mores.
There seems to be a definite lack of screaming, that has to be good.
Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.

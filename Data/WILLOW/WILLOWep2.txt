No! Nooo! Get -- off --
Xander, are you okay?
I don't know -- they surrounded us -- he was really weak...
Oooh... I need to sit down.
Oh. Good for me.
If you hadn't showed up, they would have... taken us too... Does anybody mind if I pass out.
Breathe.
This is probably the dumb question, but shouldn't we call the police?
We don't have to say vampires. We could say there was... a bad man.
I don't remember hearing a car...
Uh, guys? There may be another way.
This runs under the graveyard.
Uh, well, in a way. I sort of stumbled onto them when I accidentally... decrypted the city council's security system.
Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place full of monsters, but I do want to help. I need to.
Oh! Yeah. Sure. I can do that.
No, she's not.
She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.
"Deliver."
It's just me. So there's no word?
Well, I'm sure they're... great.
I think maybe. I looked through the old papers, around the time of that big earthquake back in '37. And for several months before it, there was a rash of murders.
They sound like the kind you were looking for. Throats, blood. Months, and not even a clue.
Did you find Jesse?
Was he dead?
At least you two are okay.
But he blew it. Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed about half the town. And him too -- or at least there were no more vampire-type killings after.
Are you sure?
Did we win?
Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.
Next time is why?
More vampires?
Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.

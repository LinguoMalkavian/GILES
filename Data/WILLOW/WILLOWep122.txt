I'm in wicked trouble now.
Ooh, sorry. Can't do that. I'm not finished yet.
New trick from the old dog. That's borrowed power. Now way it's strong enough to -
Thanks, but I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching... Butting in on things that don't concern you...
I don't want to fight you either. I wanna fight him.
No.
Asmodea, bring forth--
What--? No! Off me-- Solvo! Libero--
This... won't hold me... forever.
Willow doesn't live here anymore.
Solutum.
Shame on you.
That all you got, Jeeves?
Hurt me? Boy, you just don't get it, do you? Nothing can hurt me anymore. This...?
You can ask her yourself.
Unless... Somebody, somehow... Can get there in time to save them. Huh. Oh, well...
Good luck.
you're such a hypocrite. Waltzing back here with borrowed magicks... So you can tell me, what...? Magic is bad? Behave? Be a good girl? I don't think you're in any position to tell me what to do.
You were jealous. Still are. Just... couldn't bear that I was the one with power. That's why you ran. That's why you--
That... was... rude. Now I forgot what I was saying.
Blah blah blah.
What I need...
Yeah. I can. I have to stop this. I'll make it all go away.
And I know just the place to make it happen.

Always the Slayer...
And it is the last, you know... For all your fighting... Thinking you're saving the world...
It's the only way to stop the pain. I... I can't take it anymore...
It was me that took you out of the Earth. Well, now...

Get out of here.
I'm not joking, Xander. Get out of my way. Now.
You can't stop this.
Is this the master plan? You're going to stop me by telling me you love me?
Still making jokes.
Don't call me th-
You think I won't?
Shut up.
Shut up.
Stop...

(a whisper) Buffy... it's hideous. My god, Buffy, look at its arms!
Duty-schmooty. I'm s'posed to be the best man. Shouldn't I be all Marlene Dietrichy in a dashing tuxedo number?
Maybe if I ask Anya I can still go with the traditional blood larva and burlap. I mean, she was a vengeance demon for like a thousand years, she'd know all the most flattering... larvae. What was she thinking?
Ohmigod, last night. That rehearsal dinner. It was a zoo without the table manners. And I bet it got worse after we left.
And Xander's family, I haven't seen 'em that bad since my bat mitzvah. Did you see how much they drank?
There we go...tuck that there and let's see, maybe one little flower here...
Yeah.
Giles sent 'em. Aren't they gorgeous?
Me too. And I'm sure he'd much rather be here than fighting that nasty demon--
Daemon, too right. But Giles' got responsibilities. And so Anya and Xander have flowers. And flowers. And more flowers. Ooh, it's going to be so pretty!
Oh, Dawnie you look beautiful. Well, okay, but as good as anyone could, considering.
Want me to hold it shut for you?
Wow. You look lovely. Really lovely.
You can't. It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her dress, 'member?
I'll say this for the Y chromosome: looks good in a tux.
You're getting married. My little Xander.
It's a good thing I realized I was gay. 'Cause otherwise, hey, you, me and formal wear...
Ready for the long walk?
Take your time. Not like they can start the wedding without you.
He's gone. Xander's disappeared.
I'm going to look, I'm going to find him. And you're going to stall.
Anyone else waiting for it to go 'poof'? Maybe we can cover it with flowers.
You okay?
She wants to be alone. That's what she wants. Oh god, it hurts my heart to think of her.
I don't know. I mean, I feel like I should be hating Xander. But I can't I just. I just hope he's okay.

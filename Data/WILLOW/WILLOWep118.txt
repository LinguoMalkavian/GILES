Look at you. All coming-out-of-class and everything.
Right.
It's between a hitch and a kink. With a side of twinge. It's okay.
Ha! Yes! Refreshing san-- that's funny! She's okay. A little... freaked. I'm glad she didn't hurt you.
Uh, I didn't...
Oh, um... various sounds of hesitation...
Friends are nice!
Officially, of course, I have to say that I have no idea what you're talking about.
We should get coffee some time. Maybe some day this week after class.
You could, you could bring your friend.
No! I'm, oh, I'm friendless.
Many dear friends, yeah. But --
With us. Who are... just friends.
It was this thing, and it came out from inside her head.
Well... let's put it this way. If I wasn't gay before...
Yes.
Oh, did I tell you about the demon eggs?
So, what, no rollicking adventures in the dorms?
Are friends with?
Oh my god. You're back.
But you're back now. Right?
If there's anything we can do, just let us --
We're more centered around the girl on girl action.
Well, Xander is a man, so it's kinda not the surprise that he likes to watch... Girls... Why are we talking about this?
Should have something once I get tapped into the fiber-optic network. We're gonna use the feedback relay to get their signal routed into our system.
(as she types) Can't help thinking maybe you were closer than you thought that day you went out with the addresses.
Makes sense.
Hey. Hey, I think I got something!
Technology's pretty sophisticated, lots of booby traps and firewall stuff...
Oh, yeah. But, you know, who is the bigger nerd, the nerd, or the nerd who breaks through his defense system? (not looking up) Okay, no one answer that, please.
(of course I can) Hey. I'm still me. Just one -- whoa.
There are other cameras.
Oh my God. The Double Meat Palace. The Bronze. My classrooms on campus, Xander's site...
I can tell there are more feeds, I'm just having a harder time pinpointing 'em. Here, lemme...
Here, I think there are a couple more transmitters on the network, I've almost got us tapped into picture on 'em.
I think I got the Magic Box --
Wait, Xander, no.
Buffy...
(snapping to) Here, lemme...
Buffy. Xander's gone. And he took your axe.
Tara...
Are you okay?
I know.

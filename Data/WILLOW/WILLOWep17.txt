She’s sad because her lover gave her a dozen gold coins but then the wizard cut open the bag of salt and the dancing minions had no place to put their big Maypole… …fish thing.
Because of that thing he did with her feet? No, that was personal.
Hey, I know – we could go to the Bronze, sneak in our own tea bags and ask for… hot water.
You dreamed about Angel again?
What did he do in the dream?
Ooh, stuff. Was it one of those vivid dreams where you could feel his lips and smell his hair?
Well you guys are so right for each other, except for the, uh…
That doesn’t make him a bad person. Necessarily.
Well maybe not in the day time… but you could ask him for coffee some night. It’s the non-relationship drink of choice. It’s not a date, it’s a caffeinated beverage – okay it’s hot and bitter, like a relationship that way but —
You cut three periods.
Aren’t you s’posed to be doing your homework in the library –
Yeah, with their charmed lives and their movie star good looks and more money than you can count… I’m hating.
What made you change your mind?
He’s going with you? She’s got a date with Angel. Isn’t that exciting?
Cordelia ? Did I sound a little jealous just then? Cause I’m not really… Cordelia ?
What happened with Angel?
I don’t understand. He likes you. More than likes.
The frat guy.
I’ve seen something like that somewhere…
Yeah, in Sunnydale, what a surprise.
You lied to Giles.
Like you don’t have a sick mother but you’d rather go to a Fraternity party where there’ll be drinking and older boys and probably an orgy?
I’ve heard some really wild things go on at the Delta Zeta parties.
I can’t believe she lied to Giles. My world is all askew.
Askew means cockeyed.
Well, there’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll help Giles –
What?
You want to protect her. And you want to prove you’re as good as those rich, snotty guys. And maybe catch an orgy.
Bent.
Rent.
Kent – Kent, that’s it!
No. Kent Preparatory School. Just outside town. That’s where I’ve seen those bracelets.
Pulling up their school newsletter for the last few months, to see if there’s anything about…
This being Sunnydale and all, I guess we can rule out something good.
No!
Because Buffy… and her mother…
You mean like if there are others…?
Brittany Oswald, Junior at St. Michael’s, disappeared a year ago… so did Kelly Percell, sophomore at Grant…
Almost to the day.
Killer? Now there’s a killer? We don’t know there’s a…
Gulp.
Angel.
Oh. Sorry. The reflection thing, that you don’t have. Angel, how do you shave? -- Miner’s Woods. That’s out by the college, right behind… … the Delta Zeta house.
Buffy -- !
-- is there. With Cordelia. They went to a party at the Delta Zeta house!
Well …
Well …
Looks like everyone’s gone.
There’s a bunch of girls missing, the Delta Zetas may be involved and Buffy – are you wearing make-up?
With the missing girls.
Some guy’s attacking Buffy with a sword! (beat, realizes: ) Also, there’s a really big snake.
Guys, Buffy, snake, basement, now!
They didn’t find the snake? Which means we probably will some day. Oh goody.
Have you heard from Angel?

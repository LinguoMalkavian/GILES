Come back . Come back ...
Hear me! Keeper of darkness-
Please. Please... Bring her back-
How? How is this natural?
But I-
No. There's got to be a way-
NO!
How did this happen?
Warren?
Where do you keep the black arts books?
I need power.
Stop .
Now .
No she isn't.
It's so small.
Buffy. Hey-
I'll explain. But we've got to go-
It's time to find Warren.
Faster -
Faster-
We're close. I can feel him.
If I wasn't, you'd be dead.
Sometimes you don't have a choice.
Turn! Go right!
Over there! Go the other way! Now!
(commanding voice) Turn .
Stay back .
Get out .
It's a robot.
Then we'll kill him.
Calm down?
He hit Tara.
Guess the last shot was the charm.
She's dead. And now he's dead.
I'm busy.
Don't -
How can you say that? Tara is dead .
I'm not coming back.
We won't. Not your way.
No. No more talking.
It's done !
Blood of the slain - hear me. Guide me to Tara's killer.
Run all night, Warren. I'll still find-
Axe - not gonna cut it.
Oh. You mean, instead of killing my best friend you killed my girlfriend-
Well this is.
Irretite.
Ensnare.
Cute tricks.
I'm asking for it.
She wasn't your first.
Tara. She wasn't the first girl you killed.
(in Latin) Reveal.
Because you liked it.
You never felt like you had the power with her. Not until you killed her-
Now you get off on it. That's why you had such a mad-on for the slayer. She was the big O - wasn't she, Warren?
What's the matter? I thought you wanted to talk.
Okay.
Shhhhhh.
(cutting him off) Want to know what a bullet feels like, Warren? A real one? It's not like in the comics.
I think you need to. Feel it.
It's not going to make a neat little hole. First - it'll obliterate your internal organs. Your lung will collapse. Feels like drowning...
When it finally hits your spine, it'll blow your central nervous system-
I'm talking . The pain will be unbearable, but you won't be able to move... Bullets usually travel faster than this, of course. But the dying? It's going to seem like it takes forever.
I said - can you feel it?
Bored now.
One down.

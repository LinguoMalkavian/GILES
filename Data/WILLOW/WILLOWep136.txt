You're luring me. I know when I'm being lured.
You're trying to get me alone and, you know, kiss or something...
He asked you out to dinner?
Well, I assume it's not 'cause he likes your company.
Sure. You're a frisky vixen.
Oh. Right. That would make sense too.
You'll have to dress for the ambiguity.
Not really a shower.
Can we go back to the eye contact? I mean, Buff, if he really is interested in you... are you interested back?
They're the Potentials'. Turns out, they each have two feet.
But you did duck the question. Are you interested in Principal Wood?
I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come 'round again before I jump on.
Right. You could move on.
I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let someone get close.
Buffy got a date!
Which makes him, like a hundred years younger than your "type."
I think they're gonna end up making out. "Oh, Principal Wood," she'll gasp, "I love your lack of wicked energy..."
How 'bout yours, Xander? Is she evil?
Looks like you found her some stuff.
Sure. I'll have the Potentials help out. It'll be a learning exercise. Want me to check out your girl at the same time, Xand?
I've Googled 'til I just can't Google no more. He's not in there.
And it doesn't leave a lot of options. Either this guy has lived completely under the radar his whole life, or he only recently came into existence, or maybe he just took on a new identity, or he's a computer whiz who covered his own tracks.
What's this?
You showed her these?
Meantime, you wanna join us in the researchy? We're trying to invade Buffy's date's privacy.
Buffy's actually investigating Principal Wood. It's not a date.
It might be a date.
The First. It screamed... I think it knows about the wire.
Only that. The whole rest of the time, Andrew's voice is fine, but in between is just silence or static.
I'm hearing something.
So, we're thinking, it didn't go too well.
To study it, see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. Because, guys, we've gotta face it, we know nothing about The First.
I'll call.
No. It's a text message. Oh! It's from Xander. It's one of our signals.
It's a system we set up a while back. Like, codes. This is either the one for "I just got lucky, don't call me for a while" or "my date's a demon who's trying to kill me."
It was long time ago!
That's okay.
His slut didn't eat him up. Besides, I thought you were all angry at him.
What happened?
Okay. What happened to Xander?
What?

It'll probably wear off in a day or-
Oh. Hey! This is Amy. Amy, Tara. Tara, Amy.
Amy. Amy the rat . Sorry.
Amy-
Tara, wait, you left some clothes and stuff. I saved them for-
Tara-
I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
We were out. We kinda lost track of time and...
I mean, I never would have if we thought you weren't coming home-
I - I've got to get some sleep.
Okay. I'll call you later?
Yeah. I'm going to crash too. Night Dawny.
Claudete. WILLOW Close.
Already? So, things with your dad...
What did you tell him? I mean, about where you were?
Sorry. It's just, I guess I didn't expect you to be in a jokey mood.
There was a little ball. And you seemed to enjoy playing with those cardboard toilet paper rolls-
Well, I do. Get it. Totally.
Yeah, I don't even think I can. I felt awful today. And I couldn't do magic. It took all day for my powers to come back... We should probably take it easy.
What?
Really? He's a warlock?
Is it dangerous?
Where? I thought you said the guy lived around here.
What do you-
It's... hot.
Yeah..
Rack? Whose-
I don't mean to. Vibe at you. If it's in a negative way-
Not so much. I mean, I can do stuff. But I get tapped out quick. And I've used practically every spell I know-
I don't know. I thought... Amy said-
No. I have money, a little, but-
Well maybe I could help you with your computer. I'm pretty handy with-
No thanks. I'm more in water mode.
I'm sure. My tummy's feeling a little rumbly.
Oh. Did she need help?
About that... I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here.
Right. Totally. We could do something if you want. A movie maybe.
Nothing a little Dawny time won't fix. If you feel like bagging the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner.
Great. This'll be great. I'll just grab the paper, see what's playing.
So the burger was okay? You liked it?
I will. I'll eat. I'm saving myself for popcorn.
She is?
Of course. You can't be close to someone like that and not be... But it was all for the best, I think.
She does? Did she say something?
Oh.
No. I'm fine. And Tara's in her new place? Settled and everything?
Yeah... I kind of took you the long way around, but we're almost there...
I don't know. But it's cool, isn't it? Now, you just hang here for a minute and I'll be right back. You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?
We'll make it. I mean, it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers.
Hey, Dawny! Come on, it's movie time-
I'm fine. Let's get out of here.
So what do you want to do, cutey?
No way. I said we were going to have fun. We are going to have fun.
"I think we should get out of here." It's grown up time, Dawny. You want to play with the grown ups or not?
Oh, God. Don't get all weird. We're fine. Everything's fine.
So go. God, I thought we were going to hang-
I don't know. Maybe I could just... pop you back?
Dawny. Don't. It's a cat or a-
Don't. Don't hurt her. She has nothing to do with this. It was me-
Get in!
Operi! WILLOW Shut!
Age . WILLOW Drive .
Yes!
Oh God, Dawn, there's blood-
Is she okay? Is she okay?
No, you're okay - right Dawn? I mean-
Dawny, Dawny - I'm so sorry. It was an accident. I just - I didn't see. I'm so, so sorry...
I screwed it up. Everything. Tara...
I know, I know- I can't stop, Buffy. I tried, and I can't.
I can't. Please help me. Oh, God, I need help...
Is she okay?
But she's going to be alright?
I didn't mean to. I wasn't going to... We were just going to the movies.
I don't know. The magic. I thought I had it under control. And then... I didn't.
No. It started before she left. It's why she left.
It was... But, I mean, if you could be plain old Willow - or Super Willow? Who would you want to be? I guess you don't actually have the option on the whole "super" thing.
Don't I? Buffy, who was I? Just some girl. Tara didn't even know that girl...
We don't know that-
It just, it took me away from myself. I felt so... free.
If something had happened to Dawn tonight, something worse...
I don't think you do. I was out of my mind. I did things... I can't even...
It's not worth it. Not if it messes with the people I love. I mean, it'll be hard. But I can do it. I know I can.
Totally. And magic wasn't all great. I mean, I won't miss the nose bleeds and the headaches and stuff.
Or keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra. (off Buffy's look) Don't ask.
'Cause it's over.
It'll probably wear off in a day or-
Oh. Hey! This is Amy. Amy, Tara. Tara, Amy.

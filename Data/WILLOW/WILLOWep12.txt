Huh? Oh. No. Yes. "Date me" is silly.
You're doing fine.
Direct and to the point.
Buffy's not here. You could practice on me some more...
Oh, you know. The usual.
Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.
I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age; nerds are in. They're still in, right?
A thing? The thing! That I have! Which is a thing. I have to go to it. See you later!
No you don't.
What kind?
Sure.
Sure.
Hey.
How'd it go?
Oh.
Well, what did she say?
At least now you know.
No.
There's no way.
You think I'm gonna spend an evening with you watching you wish you were spending an evening with her? You think that's my idea of high jinks? You should know better.
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. I'll see you Monday.
He probably forgot. It's not that big a deal.
Right. I'm furious.
I've seen so much, I thought I could take anything. But Buff.... This was... this was different, it...
I'm trying to think how to say it. To explain it so you understand.
I'm not okay. I can't imagine what it's like to be okay. I knew those guys. I go to that room every day. And when I walked in there, it was... It wasn't our world anymore. They made it theirs. And they had fun.
What are we gonna do?
I tried to reach Xander, but he's not picking up. I'll go by his house tomorrow. We'll get together and figure out what to do.
Buffy. I like your dress.
I knew it. I told you something was going on with her.
I think he's right.
Xander --
Well, how can we help her?
How come she's in the club?
Xander...
Huh?
Right. Okay.
Well, the last time the Master tried to rise was the Harvest. He sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood. Maybe this is the same.
The prom.
We will.
What if they get to the Bronze before us?
Don't worry? Why not?
I vote panic.
Not caring...
We've got to get to the library.
Of course, we generally walk there...
The bookshelves!
This won't keep them out for long!
Wow. Harsh.
Buffy?
You can come with us, Angel. Get something to drink. Or, no... don't do that. Just hang out.
Huh? Oh. No. Yes. "Date me" is silly.

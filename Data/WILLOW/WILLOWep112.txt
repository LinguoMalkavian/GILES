You shoulda seen their headquarters, it was like, the nerd natural habitat.
We tried. Buffy was gonna go in there and bust 'em on the spot.
Yeah, She went in there, but --
Hey, respect the narrative flow much?
Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out. She brought back what was left, spell books and parchments.
Interesting turn.
Right. For the rest of your life.
Dawny, you want a burger or anything? I could get you whatever you want.
Oh, sorry, just, but I was listening. Something wrong.
Standing right here. Standing right exactly here.
C'min.
Do you need something?
You want it? Really?
It's not stupid. You can have it, of course.
It's good. Really good. It was hard there for a while. Frustrating, you know, having to do everything the slow way. It was like, is everything gonna take forever... forever?
But it's better now. I'm getting my focus back.
It's a pivotal page.
What? No.
Don't think that's the way to look at it.
Um, no, it's not. Although now that you mention it, Buffy's is next--
Amy? Wh-- Uhhhn.
Late! Late! Sorry! I was just, I was reading for school. Highlighting. Anyway late.
What're we doing? Let's jump right in. Did Xander say there was food?
Whoa. Bad.
I... Yeah, I can, uh, I can get right on analyzing that. With science. Not... I can use science. You ate it?
Cool! You go. We'll be good.
I'm just, I'm worried about Buffy She could be walking into anything.
Don't need magic. Don't need it, don't need it...
Hey, guys. I think I've got it!
No! No potions! It's not magic. It's chemistry. You can tell by how damn slow it is. I made a solution that reacts to the proteins in human blood. We're pretty close to knowing for certain.
Xander, hold this for me.
There's no reaction...
...which means it's not human.
Hm.
No... but... I'm not sure what I'm seeing. Cellulose?
Are you in there, Buffy? I can't see you inside.
Buffy... there's more. Something Happened today. I didn't do it. Amy did it. But I feel so bad about it...
Buffy!
Missed me.
I got it, Buffy! I killed it! Look!
Ewwww.
Amy.
You really can't.
I can't spend time with you anymore.
You can't come in here again.
That's right.
You don't get it. What you did to me was wrong. You dosed me, Amy. Do you have any idea how much harder that makes, just, everything?
Shut up.
Amy. If you really are my friend, you better stay away from me. And if you really aren't... You better stay away from me.

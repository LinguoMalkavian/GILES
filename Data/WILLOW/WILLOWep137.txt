Oh. Hey. Hi. Well, Buffy, I see our preparations for the... school... pep-dance-cheer-drill-contest are really coming along. "Bring it On!"
Oh, thank God.
You're Wood.
Oh. Yes. Nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, safer stuff. And you know, I've found there's a lot of really great spells you can cast without...
Which I almost did.
Well, that's why I'm sticking just to Magicks with little training wheels on them. You know. One day at a time.
Thanks. If Kennedy asks? Her pointy stuff's here. See you inside, and... So much cooler than Snyder.
No she's not.
Come on, Buffy. You know everyone here's already doing everything they can.
Those are Muppets.
No it doesn't! It doesn't say that! Where does it say that?
Buffy, we have no idea where you're going or how to get you back!
How will we get you back?
She's gone.
I'm trying! Uh, um... Redi ! WILLOW
We need Buffy.
Thanks for your support.
There isn't. And Buffy knew it. I have to get her back.
I have no idea how to re-open your run-of-the-mill time/space portal. Let alone the big kahuna. Dawnie, what's the book say.
Oh.
I, I don't even know what kind of magic to use.
That's not the worst that can happen.
That's what I'm saying, I don't even know...
Uh... physics. Principles, basic laws.
Conservation of energies. You can't really create or destroy anything. Just.. transfer.
Magicks work off physics.
What, like a Kraken's Tooth?
Maybe. Until we get the Magicks up and running, I'm kind of working on my best guess here.
I don't think waiting's the best idea right now. Opening a portal this size, could take days.
I think I might pee in my pants.
Via temporis, iam clamo ad te, via spatii, te jubeo aperire. WILLOW Avenue of time, I call now upon you, avenue of space, I say thee, open.
Aperi ! WILLOW Open!
Dawnie, you better put on some coffee, this could take a...
Via, concursus, tempus, spatium, audi me ut imperio... WILLOW Avenue, convergence, time, space, hear me as I command...
Screw it. Mighty forces, I suck at Latin, okay? But that's not the issue! I am in charge here and I am telling you, open this portal NOW!
No!
You okay? You've been kinda quiet since...
Yeah. Since that. It's important you know. What I am. What I'm like when I'm... like that.
I'm sorry. You were the most powerful person nearby. That's how it works. It's how I work.
You okay?
It's what I do.
I don't know. Usual way I guess?
Showed you what?
Why? Buffy. What did you see?

No, it doesn't.
Is there anything you don't know everything about?
Paraguay.
It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules, the energy... everything's connected.
I'm sorry.
Had gone evil? Yeah, I was gonna destroy the world, but lunch made me sleepy.
Afraid. They all are. The Coven is... they're the most amazing women I've ever met. If it wasn't for them, and you... But there's this look they get, like I'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash or something. Which I'm not even sure what that is.
I don't have that much power, I don't think. I was... drained by what happened.
You should just take it from me.
Will they always be afraid of me?
I deserve a lot worse.
I killed people, Giles.
When you brought me here... I thought it was to kill me. Or lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity, or with the torture... instead, you go all Dumbledore on me, I'm learning about magic, I'm all about energy and gaia and root systems.
I wanna be Willow.
Giles... I can't... goddess...
What happened?
We were talking. And I felt --
It's gonna open. It's gonna swallow us all.
There's so much I don't understand yet. About control, and, and potions I'm not good with. Plus, many concepts I appeared to understand, I was only nodding and hmmmming in a pretend fashion so as to not look dumb.
Then why are you gonna ask me to?
No, it doesn't.

Ballpoints are tricky.
Hey. Riley. Hi. Um, I noticed you left a name off the role call today. Osbourne. Daniel Osbourne? Oz.
Oh, you heard way wrong then. He's not gone. He just left temporarily - to work out a few things. That sounds lame in its vagueness I know, but I assure you, Oz will be back.
Oh, but...
Oh. Riley. Hi.
What's up?
She's not here.
But what do you want me to do?
(big sigh) Okay. Let's say I help. And you start a conversation. It goes great. You like Buffy. She likes you. You spend time together. Feelings grow deeper, and one day without even realizing it, you find you're in love. Time stops and it feels like the whole world's made for you two and you two alone until the day one of you leaves the other and rips the still-beating heart from the other who's now a broken, hollow mockery of the human condition.
I figured it was.
Why should I trust you?
I've seen honest faces. They usually come attached to liars.
She likes cheese.
I'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but Buffy? She likes cheese.
And she has a stuffed piggy named Mr. Gordo, loves Ice Capades without the irony and she's dragging me to a party at Lowell House tonight.
Then that will give you a chance to interact. But don't get fresh!
(polite smile) Sorry.
I'm not your accomplice.
I'm not.
We're clear?
Uh huh.
No, no. we're here for fun.
You go, I need a soda.
I'm okay. Really.
You ask her to dance.
(looking at him) What's wrong?
Then talk. Keep eye contact, funny is good, but don't be glib and remember: if you hurt her, I will beat you to death with a shovel.
You really, really did.
You failed extremely well.
You have to relax. You're not proposing -- I sincerely hope -- you're just making contact. Getting a reaction. Any reaction is okay, except projectile vomiting and what are the chances of --
The song...
(small voice) Big.
Thank you. Now go find Buffy.
I want you to tell Buffy that I went home and not to worry about me. Which will at least give you something to say.
You'll do fine.
Come in.
I'll scream.
Maybe you were nervous.
You're probably just trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
It's me, isn't it?
You came looking for Buffy, then settled. You didn't want to bite me, I just happened to be around.
Really?
When?
I never would have guessed. You play the blood-lust kind of cool.
But if you could, you'd ...
You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.
You're being too hard on yourself. Why don't we both just wait half an hour and try again? Or .....

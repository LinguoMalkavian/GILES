It's all right. A vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
I live nearby. I was just out walking.
Why would I do that?
Maybe I like you.
Hello, nice to meet you.
Look, I don't want to get you in any more trouble.
I don't see them . . .
Somebody has to.
They're dead.
It was.
It was a long while ago.
You even look pretty when you go to sleep?
Hmmm?
I don't know, it's been a long time since anyone was in a position to let me know.
I read a little . . . . . . and just thought about a lot of things. Buffy, I --
I --
Buffy --
Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up, I watched her from the closet. I didn't read it, I swear.
I did a lot of thinking today, I can't really be around you . . .
Because when I am . . .
. . . all I can think about is how badly I want to kiss you --
I'm older than you and this can't ever . . . (opens window) . . . I better go.
I really should . . .
Who's here?
A lifetime.
What's with the Catholic-School Girl look. Last time I saw you it was Kimonos.
You did some damage yourself.
No, but I'm not exactly one of you, either.
Maybe you don't want to be.
Let her go.
Leave me alone.
All right .
I want it finished.
Let's get it done.
Come on. Don't go soft on me now.
A little wide . . .
Feels good, doesn't it? Feels simple.
Why not? I killed mine.
I killed their friends, and their friends' children. For a hundred years I offered an ugly death to everyone I met. And I did it with a song in my heart.
And then I made an error of judgment. Fed on a girl about your age. Beautiful. Dumb as a post, but a favorite among her clan.
The Romani -- -- Gypsies. It was just before the turn of the century. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.
When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body. But it doesn't get the soul. That's gone. No conscience, no remorse . . . it's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done, and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being since that day.
I didn't bite her.
But I wanted to. I can walk like a man but I'm not one. I wanted to kill you tonight.
I just wanted to make sure you're okay, and your mother . . .
If I can go a little while without getting shot or stabbed I'll be all right.
Look . . . this can't . . .
I just gotta . . . I gotta walk away from this.
I know.
It's just . . .

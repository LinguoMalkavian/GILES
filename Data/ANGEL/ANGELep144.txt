Well, I guess that qualifies as "happy to see me."
Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.
Got your share of distress, though.
I got coverage on the whole thing. Very gripping, needs a third act.
It's the First. Right? The First Evil, The power that tried to convince me to kill myself.
Well it failed once, and I'm here to tell you that --
Okay, now I'm pissed. Where is he?
That would still be the case.
I'm out of line.
Not remotely.
I brought something else as well.
It's not for you.
I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. Has a purifying power... or a cleansing power - or possibly scrubbing bubbles, the translation is... anyway it bestows strength, worn by the right person.
Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me.
No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, you've already got that cool axe-thing.
Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours.
No, what?
Why the hell not?
You need me in this.
Why?
If I'm here we have a better shot at capping this thing. I've read the files --
Okay. That's one reason. What's the other?
Is it Spike?
Is he your boyfriend?
Are you in love with him?
Oh. Well.
No, no, that's great. Everyone's got a soul now.
No, it's great. One for our side.
You know, I started it. (right to her) The whole... having a soul. Before it was all the "cool new thing"...
I'm gettin' the brush off for Captain Peroxide, it doesn't bring out the champion in me.
For who?
Aha! Boyfriend!
That'll end well.
Because you're the Slayer?
Yet another curveball...
Any thoughts on who might enjoy... do I have to go with the cookie analogy?
I get it.
Sometimes is something.
I ain't gettin' any older.

Hey--
Is this a bad time?
I heard you were on the hunt.
When you first wake up, it's a little disorienting. He'll show.
It's weird to go through. You're here alone?
I just thought you'd have somebody with you... Xander or someone.
Or someone.
Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.
"Danced with" is a pretty loose term. "Mated with" might be a little closer --
I am not jealous!
See? Whenever we fight, you always bring up the vampire thing.
I didn't touch your stake...
Look, obviously I made a mistake coming here tonight...
So another vampire has risen tonight.
Cordelia. This is the last place I expected you to hang out.
I wasn't sure it was you at first. I'm looking for Buffy.
She said she'd be home.
Xander.
I thought you were taking the night off.
Cordelia told me the truth.
I know. We found some of them.
I mean, like some of them. Like parts.
What I saw didn't add up to three whole girls. I think they kept some parts.
This was no hatchet job. Whoever made those incisions really knew what they were doing.
I...
I saw the fire, figured you'd be here. Is everyone okay?
Sounds like he took it a little over the edge.
The what?
Oh. Crazy like a 241 year old being jealous of a high school junior?
I thought about it. Maybe he bothers me a little.
But he's in your life. He gets to be there when I can't. Take your classes, eat your meals, hear your jokes and complaints. He gets to see you in the sunlight.
It'll be morning soon. I should probably...

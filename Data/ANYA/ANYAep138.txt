For God's sake, Andrew! You've been in here thirty minutes, what are you doing?
And birds need to fly and girls need to use the toilet. Why were you videotaping yourself anyway? Sounds like kinky business to me.
If there are any. Buffy seems to think this apocalypse is going to actually be, you know, apocalyptic. I think your project sounds pretty pointless.
They were always my best feature, even as a demon. Other demons would comment.
I'll put it on the list.
Yeah. For future generations.
That's what you're calling it?
I know I am. What do you have to say for yourself one year later?
Of course he doesn't think it was the right thing to do!
What?!
But... but... we still... we still spark! I get jealous of you, you get jealous of me! You still love me!
You keep ducking the question.
Please, stop this. Just tell me. Are you saying you still love me?
I love you too. And I don't know if that means anything either.
And, the thing is, I miss you.
It's not the same. I miss having you here, in my head. There was always this little part of my brain that was... aware of you, you know? Like, noticing things to tell you later, or wondering what you were doing right then. And that part's all empty now.
I was too hurt. I couldn't.
It's okay.
Yeah?
It's okay.
Yeah?
Well, well.
It certainly was, you carpenter you.
You said it.
Well, yes. I'm a spitfire in the bedroom. But did it feel... like we used to feel?
I guess we should expect that. We're different now.
That feeling.
Yeah.
I guess it does.
So we can do what? Pretend this is still us? Pretend it's not over and we still feel something we don't?
Okay.

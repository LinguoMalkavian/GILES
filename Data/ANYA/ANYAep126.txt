It is hard. I know, it is. But, honestly? I bet you'll feel better if you talk about it. A lot better.
Talk to me.
Ucch. And he didn't do anything? No flowers, no card, no dinner at an extravagantly over-priced restaurant?
What a creepazoid. It's like he didn't just forget your birthday, but the day on which, in keeping with modern American tradition, one's life is celebrated. One's very self. (then; dire) He didn't celebrate your self.
You know what? I think you deserve vengeance.
How old are you?
Just wishful thinking... But imagine if he was forced, for thirt--
Did he know this? That you're freaked about being--
No big deal. Like no cake, no party, no presents, no big deal?
Thirty isn't old. Believe me. But anyway, this boyfriend of yours - it sounds like maybe he was just trying to do what you wanted.
But he tried. I mean, he tried to respect your wishes.
It's not too late. You could just celebrate being twenty-nine again.
Knock yourself out.
Wait...

...just left, so I had to walk down the aisle, in the big white dress, to tell everyone the wedding was off. And they were all looking at me with, like, such pity--
I don't think it's really a date, that's what I think.
It also says "I spilled grape juice." I'm not sure I can fix this.
I wasn't talking about your date anyway. I'm talking about this sham date of Xander's. I think this is part of plan to make me jealous.
Fine, go. Leave me to stew in my impotent rage.
Giles made them for Chao-Ahn and now she's locked herself in the bathroom. There's a lot of girls up there and they're starting to complain.
Oh yes, didn't you hear? Everyone has a date. Buffy has a date, Willow's been completely making out with this girl...
...and Xander's out with some hardware store whore. It's date-fest two-thousand-and-three!
Well, now we know not to record it. So that's something.
I wasn't here but I imagine it was a very manly display of hyperventilating. What did it want you to do, anyway?
Say, that's gratifying.
It's after two. I can't believe Buffy hasn't brought him home yet. His slut ate him up.
My feelings are changeable but intense.
Yes, but you deserve to be in trouble. I didn't kill anybody. Well, not directly or irreversibly. Lately.
I'm worried. I think we need to go find them. Xander could be injured or trapped or eaten up...
Is Xander all right?
Damn him!
Serve you right.

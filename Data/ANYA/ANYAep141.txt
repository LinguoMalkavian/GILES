...so we know that a battle is coming. Ubervamps galore.
But I've been out talking to my old contacts, and they've provided some surprising bits of news. Yay for them.
Oh. Right. But the heart thing is still good to know since holy water runs off these guys like they're scotch-guarded, and sunlight would work, but, guess what, they're not coming out during the day.

Andrew's got plenty of tears left in him, just tell him they canceled Stargate.
And it's automatically you. You really do think you're better than we are.
You do. Of course you do. That's why it's your voice leading us.
But we don't know, do we? We'll never know. That you're actually better. You came into the world with certain advantages, sure, that's the legacy.
But you didn't earn them. You didn't work for them. You never had someone come to you and say, Here, you deserve these more than anyone else. They were just... handed to you. And that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.

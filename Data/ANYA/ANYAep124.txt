Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I get it. Go on ...
God, do I want to.
... You were saying.
Before that.
After that.
No spine. Got it. I can do that.
Well, honey, what I'm driving us towards here is, sometimes, don't you just wish that ...
Tell you what: let's put a pin in it, go get yourself a beverage and we'll pick it up in a few. 'Kay?
Yes.
Hey, you wish it, I dish it. I thought we were clear on this. Didn't think you were gonna turn all narc on me.
I had a quota, the guy had it coming, what's the big?
Aww. Puppy ...
You never understood me, Xander.
Hey, nobody's bragging here.
I am.
We had a thing.
Well at least we're all bipeds, which is more than you can say for Ronnie the worm boy.
Maybe.
Same phylum, it's not cheating. I just embellished.
Bite me, Harris. I have rules to work with. Vengeance Demon codes of conduct you'll never understand 'cause you're still all so ... human.
Oh my God ...
Oh my God ...
How did you do it ... ?
I can see you ...
How did you do it?
It shouldn't be possible ...
How did you get ...
... Have nothing to talk about.
Don't think you can tell me what to do, Xander. You're not a part of my life anymore, remember?
So why are you here? Let me cast my Vengeance. Do I come to where you work and slap the ... wrench thing out of your hands?
How's that work?
Not my problem.
Uh, yeah. We're not called Vengeance People ...
Buffy wouldn't slay ... me.
What do you want me to do?
It's not that easy, Xander!
Sure, the spell part. But what about afterwards? What about me? I'm in enough trouble as it is. Halfrek's all over my case, D'Hoffryn is not pleased with my work and you don't want to see him unhappy, trust me ...
Nice friends I had. Chums, co- workers, bridesmaids ... oh I had the whole package until something fell apart, now what could that be, Xander?
All I'm saying is, none of this happened until you dumped me at the altar.
Tell him that.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I get it. Go on ...
God, do I want to.

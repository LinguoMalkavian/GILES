Willow-
Listen. Something's happened. I know. But you don't have to-
But not those books. I can't let you-
It's wearing off... Willow was here earlier. Put the whammy on me. Then she went straight to the dark arts books. Sucked them dry.
I know. Tara.
I don't need a spell. I can feel her.
Feel her. Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.
Not left over.
Yeah.
When do you think?
Got a power boost, then took off.
Normally, I'd have to - but she doesn't want me.
Yeah.
I'll help. But I'm helping Willow. She's close to him. In the woods.
She's stronger now. Close.
He's still alive. She's not done.
Over there.

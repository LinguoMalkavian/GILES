It crapped out on us.
I know. They're all gonna look like mortally wounded Easter baskets.
Oh, what does it matter?
Giles knows his single-malt antiseptics.
Yup. Many of these girls will die. Slaughter-house, is what it is.
Trying to talk will just kill you sooner.
And I could use a cookie. But I'm not making reckless wishes.
You are?
I am?
I'll get Kennedy to watch these girls. She's tough. Imminent death won't bother her.
Yes, that is consistent with the six floors we already did.
They'd only be useful if something big was attacking and then we could throw one down their throat and blow 'em up like Roy Scheider did with the shark in Jaws.
I've often thought so. Wanna rob?
Show me.
Show me the box full of ointments, you little freak.
Yeah.
Yeah. I did before.
There was this other apocalypse this one time. And I took off. But this time...
Well, I was kinda new to being around humans before. And now I've seen a lot more, gotten to know people, seen what they're capable of and I realize now that they're just so... amazingly... screwed up! I mean, so really, really screwed up in a monumental fashion!
They have no purpose that unites them so they drift around, blundering through life until they die. Which they know is coming and yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable of thinking beyond what they want at that moment. They kill each other , which is clearly insane, but here's the thing. When it's something real, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons to keep fighting. But they do. They... They never quit. And so I guess I'll fight too.
No I don't.
Stop it. I don't love them and I'll kill you if you tell anybody.
I don't know. You might survive.
Yeah.

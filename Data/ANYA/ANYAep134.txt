All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here? Right under our noses?
I'm fairly sure that's the smell of throwing a hard-boiled egg into a fire.
Oh, sure, the fun, dance-y part is wrong, but the smell, that's just -- Look. Pretty.
One second you're just a klutzy teenager with fake memories and a history of kleptomania and now suddenly you're a hero! A hero with a much abbreviated life span!
I never got that.
Yes, it's like being the pope that way. Only you don't have be some old Catholic.
Well, you could sit still for a second and a half maybe.
We also need to protect you from the eyeless guys with the sharp, sharp knives.
Dawn's gonna be a Slayer.
That's because you're part of something larger. Like getting swallowed. By something larger.
Well it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the Slayer, she'll have a short and brutal life. And if she doesn't, then her whole life smells of unfulfilled potential. The swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?
This is not about womanly power. This is about how Dawn just bought herself an early death.

What, it'd be funny, and besides, she's been sulking in there forev--
Crap.

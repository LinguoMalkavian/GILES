What have I done?
Olaf! Är du skadad? Du luktar blod och musk. ANYA Olaf! Are you injured? You smell of blood and musk.
Troll!
Trolls!
Sitt ner kära du. Låt mej passa upp dej lite. ANYA Sweetheart, please, sit down. Allow me to tend to you.
Ska bli. ANYA Certainly.
Åh, de förökar sig så snabbt att det är -- ANYA Oh, they breed so quickly that it's --
Älskling, självklart. Men här -- drick din mjod först.
Honey, of course. But here -- drink your mead first.

Did the trolls hurt you? Their mossy skin does not reflect their churlish heart.
(Swedish; bright) Å! Jag tvättade alla dina tunikor från slaget vid Asgoth, Jag smidde två hammare och ett litet svärd till dej och så lärde jag mej ett nytt recept på ox- goblin som jag tror du kommer att gilla. ANYA (English; bright) Okay! Well, I was able to get all your tunics from the battle of Asgoth cleaned, I smelted you two hammers and a small sword and I learned a new recipe for ox-goblin that I think you'll enjoy.
Och den snabba tillväxten av dina kaniner -- ålskling, sitt ner -- har gett mej en idé. Jag skulle kunna ge Överskottet till folket I stan, inte I utbyte mot gods eller service, men för gott rykte och känslan av utförande som kommer från osjälviskheten att ge till andra. ANYA And the rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits -- honey, sit down -- has given me an idea. I can give the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly giving of yourself to others.
Du har varit på krogen...
You've been to the bar...
Jag tycker inte om att du går dit.
I do not like you going there.
Var Rannveig there?
Was Rennveig there?
Förlåt. Det är bara att jag älskar dej så mycket... Ibland känna det som om jag skulle kunna brista. Jag skulle inte kunna leva utan dej. ANYA I am sorry. I simply love you so much... I feel as though I could burst at times. I could not live without you.
Willow. What are you doing here?
Oh. I, uh, have a new boyfriend now. He lives there.
Yes. We just had lots and lots of sex.
Yes, we're tremendously happy together. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for something... very important.
Thank you.
Thornton's Hope.
Eelsbane.
Bar matron. A load-bearing bar matron.
I am Aud.
No. I'm sorry.
Don't feel bad. I don't talk to people much. I mean, I talk to them, but they don't talk to me. Except to say, "Your questions are irksome" and "Perhaps you should take your furs and your literal interpretations to the other side of the river." I'm sure your group is quite well known.
Why do you keep calling me that? My name is "Aud."
What would I have to do?
Vengeance...
They all deserve it.
Oh, it's nothing. I don't... There was just so much screaming. So much blood.
I guess I'm just a little rusty. I didn't think it would hit me like this.
Really?
Oh Hallie, I can't tell you how good it is... thank goodness you're here.
It's just, lately, with everything that's been going on, I've been having trouble even rememb --
It's okay.
It's fine.
Hi Willow.
I don't have any idea what you're --
You're here to -- That's great, Willow. Flayed anybody lately, have you? How quickly they forget.
What do you want?
They got what they deserved!
I'm a Vengeance Demon . Do you understand that?
Try . They got what they deserved.
Oh stop.
I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl. I just bring it out.
Well, I don't know about her mind ...
I thought we'd go down to Madame Dubasov's. Hard to find a better spot for vengeance than a brothel.
Of course. What else is there?
What's there to be interested in? The worker will overthrow absolutism and lead the proletariat to a victorious communist revolution, resulting in socio-economic paradise on Earth. It's common sense, really. I have better things to worry about.
Yes, filled with wronged women who need my help.
I'm talking about life. Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek. I don't need anything else.
What do you want?
Everyone is so considerate today. I should have slaughtered people weeks ago.
Thank you. All better. Thank goodness you got here in time.
She's coming to try.
I have a job to do, Buffy has hers. You've always seen what you wanted to, Xander... But she knew sooner or later it would come to this.
Get out of her way, Xander.
You're apologizing to me? What fight are you watching?
Honey... honey...
Honey, was that weird? The thing earlier with the singing... and the coconuts?
Are you still hungry? Because I'd be happy to --
WHAT'S THE POINT OF LOVING I MEAN EXCEPT FOR THE SWEATY PART WHAT'S THE POINT OF LOSING YOUR HEART
NO NEED TO COVER UP MY HEART PLUS SEE ABOVE RE: SWEATY PART SO MAYBE LOVE IS PRETTY SMART
WE'LL NEVER PART NOT IF WE CAN AND IF WE START THEN HERE'S MY PLAN I'LL SHOW HIM WHAT BLISS IS WELCOME HIM WITH KISSES 'CAUSE THIS IS A MRS WHO MISSES HER MAN
HE'S MY XANDER AND HE'S AWFULLY SWELL IT MAKES FINANCIAL SENSE AS WELL ALTHOUGH HE CAN B -- I'LL NEVER TELL JUST STAND ASIDE HERE COMES THE BRIDE
I'LL BE MRS I WILL BE HIS MRS
I'd forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt.
Stop trying to save me, Xander!
I want to take it back.
I want to take it back. I want to undo what I did.
Do it.
Stay out of this, Xander.
Xander -- You can't help me. I'm not even sure... there's a "me" for you to help.
This is my wish. Undo what I did.
Hallie --
Why...
But she was yours...
You should have killed me...
Xander, please. Just go away.
Yes I should.
Thanks. For everything.
I'm a dope?
Well, that's a start.
Troll!

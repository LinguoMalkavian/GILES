That's English for "hungry."
I made the rounds, myself. Tried to dig up anything useful from the demon community.
The few that didn't attack me don't know anything or aren't talking. Either way, we got squat.
Giles...
I told you, no.
An eternal vortex, more like.
Not really. No.
Excuse me. Ex -demon here.
There's no reason to think the Beljoxa's Eye is going to have the answers we're looking for.
Why not?
C'mon, Torg, that was a lifetime ago.
Don't be so dramatic, Torg. You don't even have a heart. Six spleens. Two stomachs. Half a brain, maybe, but no heart.
It was one date. Wasn't even a date. We just happened to be invited to the same massacre... And you hit on me after I'd had a few.
Those were entrails--
Okay, Torg. Look... Just open this one little gateway to the Beljoxa's Eye for me and... And I'll... You and I... can... go to... I'll have sex with you again.
You-- You're rejecting my offer of sexual bribery?! Not that I wanted to sleep with you, but what am I, a leper in this town?! I can't even give it away!
It's my hair, right? Not attractive.
Buckle up.
God! I hate this place!
Oh, hi!
Okay, we tried. Let's go, Giles.
Yes! We all have that! It's called memory! Can you help us with something a little more... demony?
Why? Something The First did?!
I just... still don't understand how Buffy's death mucked up the Slayer mojo. Not like she hasn't died before.
NO. It's our fault. Willow and me and Xander and... and Tara. We brought her back... We're the reason The First is here. The reason all those girls were murdered--
So the whole world would've been better off if Buffy had stayed dead?!

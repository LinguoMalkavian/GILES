Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
Yeah, that was before you told me Spike's killing again. Now you want to leave me here alone with him.
What was that?
But you don't think so.
That's it? Aren't you going to, at least, leave me a crossbow or a flame thrower... something to protect myself.
Better be. 'Cause if I get vamped, I'm gonna bite your ass.
What was that?
Well... Spike... I... am here, obviously, because of the reason which I am about to tell you, with the following words, and that reason is... uh, clearly and obviously too, um... Sex.
You and me. Here and now, let's go, let's... get it on, you big bad boy.
Yes! Kinky .
Shh! No questions. No talking. I don't want any sounds to ruin the sweet, sweet love you know is still burning like a, um...
It's in my hair.
What? I can't help it. I can't stop thinking about you, and us, and the brief but unforgettable time we had together - I mean... Why else would I be here? It's not like I'm snooping around for proof you're some kind of whacked-out serial killer.
Mmm?
I get it. Buffy.
Got it No problem. I understand. (beat, genuinely offended) You think I'm fat.
Well, it's that or the haircut.
Oh - right - now you like the haircut.
Sure, as a friend.
You know you're more fun without the soul.
I'm only saying, Soulless Spike woulda had me upside down and halfway to Happy Land by now.
Who's hurt? I'm fine.
Don't stick around on my account.
Really? Is that what you want?
I used to tell the truth all the time when I was evil.
Well, if Spike is biting people then there should be more dead people with neck trauma, right? We can find that.
We can't find that? But that's easy. That computer is a moron.
Oh, an out-of-control serial killer. You're right, that is a great house guest.
He's not done being dangerous. Buffy, you keep him around, you're taking on a huge project.

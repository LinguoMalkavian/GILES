Do you think we should set up lots of candles at Buffy's party tomorrow?
I don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
This isn't some weird definition of "fine" that means hiding in your room and crying?
Because we're tired of the crying.
Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
No, they're yummy. A little cheddar cheese, some scallions, crispy rye...
No. Whole jar of mayonnaise, but...
Really. What's Sophie's last name?
Oh, we invited someone for you. A guy.
Right, no. It's just an attractive, single man with whom we hope you'll find much in common.
And if you happen to forge a romantic relationship leading to babies and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
Not yet, sweetie.
Buffy's making a new friend right now. A grown-up friend.
Nothing.
Yes you do.
Yes you are.
Yes. Xander did the building, I offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
He wanted you to have something no one else would have.
That's your friend from work?
Humm. Our friend is better.
No, you go.
No, you go.
Yes, Buffy, stay. I want to bankrupt someone.
I need to open the shop.
I think she's possessed.
So we're supposed to just wait.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Why is it so warm in here?
He's gonna die. He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
And we're just sitting here. Why are we just sitting here, why aren't we doing something?
Not like this. Not trapped like animals. Seriously, did someone turn on the heat or something, I can't, I can't even breathe...
What?
Xander...
Well, that's not completely true, is it?
No, see, that's not exactly true, either. Not can't. Won't.
Yes, and a good way to find out is to sit around not trying. That was sarcasm, by the way.
Well, so is all of us dying.
And whose fault is that? If you hadn't gotten so much of it in your system in the first place - -
Fine. If you all aren't willing to get us out of this, I'll do it myself.
She knows something! She knows something, we have to find out what.
There has to be a clue in here somewhere.
Where is it?
How could you do this?
I work hard at that store, and I helped you, I took care of you, is this how you say thank you?
How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn? You say you didn't put us here, but look at this stuff, how are we supposed to believe you?
Guidance counselor. You made a wish to someone you'd never seen before?
Did she wear a pendant? With a dark blue stone?
Oh, for crying out loud. Halfrek!!
Only a vengeance demon can break her own vengeance spell, nothing else will work. She's the only one who can get us out. Hallie, get your ass down here!!
I. Hope. You. Die. You. Stupid. Jerkface!
Her pendant! Get her pendant!
How could you - - why would you do this?
Yeah, but... cursing us? Some of them are in the wedding party.
Hmmm. Well-rounded. Is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
Mmmm-hmmm. Daddy issues.
It's, uh... it's the curse, Hallie.
Then we're gonna talk about payment. And Dawnie? Two words I want you to get used to: punitive damages.
Okay, who's shoving?

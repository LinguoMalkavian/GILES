That's still funny, sweetie.
Xander and I were fighting about Monkey Trouble.
It's a corker!
And we were arguing and then everything rhymed, and there were harmonies and a dance with coconuts...
I'VE GOT A THEORY IT COULD BE BUNNIES
BUNNIES AREN'T JUST CUTE LIKE EVERYBODY SUPPOSES THEY GOT THEM HOPPY LEGS AND TWITCHY LITTLE NOSES AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THE CARROTS WHAT DO THEY NEED SUCH GOOD EYESIGHT FOR ANYWAY BUNNIES, BUNNIES IT MUST BE BUNNIES
EXCEPT FOR BUNNIES...
Well, is it just us? Is it only happening to us? That would probably mean a spell, or...
Oh my god! Did it sing?
You don't have to get to work?
Will you still make me waffles when we're married?
THIS IS THE MAN THAT I PLAN TO ENTANGLE -- ISN'T HE FINE MY CLAIM TO FAME WAS TO MAIM AND TO MANGLE -- VENGEANCE WAS MINE BUT I'M OUT OF THE BIZ THE NAME I MADE I'LL TRADE FOR HIS THE ONLY TROUBLE IS... I'LL NEVER TELL.
'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL
HE SNORES
SAY 'HOUSEWORK' AND HE FREEZES
I TALK -- HE BREEZES
HIS PENIS GOT DISEASES FROM A CHUMASH TRIBE
THE VIBE GETS KIND OF SCARY
LIKE IT'S ALL JUST TEMPORARY
BUT IT'S ALL VERY WELL 'CAUSE GOD KNOWS I'LL NEVER TELL
WHEN THINGS GET ROUGH HE JUST HIDES BEHIND HIS BUFFY NOW LOOK -- HE'S GETTING HUFFY 'CAUSE HE KNOWS THAT I KNOW
--HIS EYES ARE BEADY!
Look at me! I'm dancin' crazy!

MY KNIGHT IN ARMOR
HE'S SWELL
HE'LL ALWAYS BE MY FELLER
I'VE READ THIS TALE THERE'S WEDDING THEN BETRAYAL I KNOW THAT COME THE DAY I'LL WANT TO RUN AND HIDE
I LIED I SAID IT'S EASY I'VE TRIED BUT THERE'S THESE FEARS I CAN'T QUELL

WE COULD REALLY RAISE THE BEAM IN MAKING MARRIAGE A HELL SO THANK GOD I'LL NEVER TELL I SWEAR THAT I'LL NEVER TELL
I TAKE THE FIFTH
I'LL NEVER TELL
It has to be stopped, Rupert --
Plus, our number was clearly a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit.
I don't know. One more verse of our little dittie I woulda been lookin' for the gas can...
Hey.
Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature but I've seen some of these underworld child- bride deals and they never end well. Maybe once.
Would you say it was a breakaway pop hit, or more of a book number?
BEADY-EYES IS RIGHT -- WE'RE NEEDED OR WE COULD JUST SIT AROUND AND GLARE
SHE CAME FROM THE GRAVE MUCH GRAVER
Xander?
WHY IS THE PATH UNCLEAR WHEN WE KNOW HOME IS NEAR

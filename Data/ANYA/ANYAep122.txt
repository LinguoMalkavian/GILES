Giles?!
How did you--
I'm blonde!
W-Willow?
I know what you're trying to do. Hate to burst your bubble, but mind control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just--
Okay.
No...
I... I don't know how.
Giles...
Giles, I'm sorry. She forced me to free her with her brain. Are you--
Oh. It's... a miracle.
Giles, you... you have to rest.
No, you're not.
Finish what?
Holy frijole!
He's... still at the magic shop.
No. And things just got a whole lot worse.
End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
She can and she will when she gets to where she's going.
Big old Satanic temple. On Kingman's Bluff.
Way up there in the hierarchy of she- demons. Her followers intended to user her effigy to destroy the world. They all died when the temple got swallowed up in the earthquake of '32.
She's going to drain the planet's life force, funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and burn the Earth to a cinder.
You can't.
I don't know. He said "the Slayer can't stop her." Then he said a bunch of other stuff... he wasn't too... clear. I should hurry and get back to him. He's... alone.
I... I don't think he has a lot of time.
What?
Giles? You're not dead.
Why aren't you dead? Why aren't I dead?
You mean she's--?
You dosed her. You knew she was going to take your powers all along.
Oh, and vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
Xander?

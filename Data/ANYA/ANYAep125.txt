What are you doing here? I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill people.
And you're back 'cause you're all better or you're back to bring about a fiery apocalypse of death?
Oh good, because I remember the last time you said that. I've spent a lot of the time since then cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood, stuff like that.
You feel really responsible?! You are really responsible! You broke my store! Plus, you killed two people.
Here's a little something you should know about Vengeance Demons. We don't groove with the "sorry." We prefer the "Oh God, please stop hitting me with my own rib-bones!"
And you won't mind?
Well then that's no fun!
Well, I'm back in my own apartment. And of course vengeance takes me all over the world. I was in Brazil yesterday. They love their soccer.
You haven't seen them?
Huh, guess they're still mad at you. They've been a little temperamental lately, just between you and me. We had a bit of a mix-up a few days ago-
Oh, at the new high school, probably. Everyone's all about the high school right now. Buffy's got some kind of job helping junior deviants. Spike is insane in the basement, and Xander's doing construction there on the gym.
Insane, base. And Xander does construction. He likes to start early so he's probably there by now.
Well, there's six poltergeists set free to terrorize, with no one making a penny of profit.
I don't have any money.
Come in! Enjoy my personal space!
Yes, that can happen.
Was it you? WILLOW Was it you?
With the skin thing, they're definitely going to think it was you. Buffy is, anyway.
And so they'll see it wasn't you, right? I mean, that has to be part of it. Maybe you're even thinking, you kill this thing, they never even have to know about it, don't have to suspect you even for a minute?
I'm surprisingly sensitive.
Is it difficult or time-consuming?
This isn't gonna get all sexy, is it?
Oh, I ate that. I have it.
How pretty! Will it hurt the carpet?
Hey look! That's me !
Yeah, things are stirred up lately. Is it... is it getting brighter?
Okay, remember our talk about the carpet?
I don't know, seems kinda thin to me.
Nope. Sorry. You damaged my carpet.
I won't. Also. I can't.
Well, see... turns out, teleporting isn't a right, it's a privilege. I withdrew a vengeance spell last week and this is my punishment. I can only teleport for official business. I have to file a flight plan and everything.
Yeah, it bites a pretty big one. And the vengeance itself, it's not as... not as fulfilling as I remember.
Well, see, causing pain sounds really cool, I know, but it turns out, it's really upsetting. It didn't used to be, but now it is.
Wow, that was really overdramatically stated, but yeah, that's it.
I'm sorry, Willow. I wish it was better for you.
It did get a little sexy, didn't it?
Hey, Willow? Isn't there another spell? I mean, you're trying to find Buffy and Xander. Couldn't we use a spell to do that?
What did it say?
Paralyzed how?
Oh, there's lots of different ways. Did you try this?
It's a common variety. Watch this.
Brazil. No need to thank me for sitting with her, by the way. I'm feeling very benevolent today. Helping Willow, helping you. Might just call it even for that worm thing last week?
She's looking for you guys, by the way. Decided you might be out in some cave.. . sounded pretty tenuous to me.
Oh yeah. Last time I saw her, that's where she was headed. You want me to make her salute? It'd be damn cute.
It's not "the Gnarl," it's just "Gnarl." Whoa. Wouldn't it be tragic if you were here having this kind of silly time with your comically paralyzed sister while Willow was dying?
Sure.
I'm out of shape! I've been teleporting for months!
She's right there. Don't you see her? She's hurt!
He's tucked way up in the rocks. You may not see him again.
Your hand. It's going right through her!
Behind you!
Willow, I'm here. Wow, you're really hurt.
Buffy's fighting him, over there. See? If they get too close I'll have to run.
But they're here. Buffy and Xander.
No one left you. They can't see you.
Good, you're doing good.
Buffy killed him. It was gross.
She's right there... okay... back off, you're kind of kneeling in her.
She's hurt really bad, you guys. I'll go get help.

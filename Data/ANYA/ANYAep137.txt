I'm a bright girl. Good education, quick on the uptake, so tell me: Why in the name of almighty Grothnar did I let myself become human again?
I mean, sure, the Vengeance Demon gig had some downsides.
But being human, bleah! You're always squishy on the inside, disgusting on the outside...
The only thing worse than being human is being trapped in a household full of humans.
It's like we live in slayer central. I swear, if Buffy rooms or boards one more of these "Potential" girls, I'm calling a health inspector.
Thanks for having me along.
At first, it was weird, I thought, "is he asking me out on a date?" 'Cause that would be...
Right there with you, Scooter. Tonight, I'm prepared to drink you under a table.
Good. Of course, once you're down there I could join you. Kidding. I like my sex on top of the table.
So what.
Okay, okay, I wasn't proposing. Time goes by, a girl gets hungry. You should know.
You're a man. With a soul, and other working parts, and it's not like Buffy's been sending any your way lately so I just thought...
What?
Hey!
...But you just let him go!
For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's killers, Spike. He won't stop coming 'til he kills me.
But you fought like such a wimp-ire, with the lifting and the running. Why not just kill him?
I'm not.
I provide... much needed... sarcasm.
Not this, we haven't.
And what the hell does that mean?
What was all that about an exchange?
Except maybe Spike.
And we've got bigger problems.
Which spell? You see how powerful that thing was? You expect to get that portal re-opened without sending Willow off the deep end?
Well it's true. There's got to be some other way.
She's right. And you know, we have a choice. Risk Willow's life and all of our lives to get Buffy back, or... leave her out there.
You missed her "everyone sucks but me" speech. If she's so superior, let her find her own way back.
Phht.
No - but at least I'm not galloping off in the wrong direction.
Not without a catalyst. If you're talking about transferring energies, you'll need some kind of conduit.

Then where do I put D'Hoffryn?
I have to! He's my ex-boss! You're inviting your work buddies.
That remains to be seen. Like you.
You cut your hair?
Oh, that sounds adorable. I was thinking about cutting mine before the wedding, maybe layering it.

I've got it!
We'll put D'Hoffryn at your parent's table and move your Uncle Rory to Table 5, next to the bar--

She's pudding?

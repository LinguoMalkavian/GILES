Oh. Oh. You two look so beautiful.
Are you guys even listening? I need feedback, people!
'I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, and to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are like a sea captain or something? I will however...' What?
Okay. Blah, blah, blah misogynistic. Blah, blah, 'I will however entrust you with my heart...'
Thanks. It's probably the blush of imprudent spending. Do you think Xander will like it? Oh! I want to see Xander now!
Oh, I can't keep all these ridiculous traditions straight. What if I'm not wearing my dress when I see him? (off their looks) Okay, no sex. Cuddling or...it's just, I'm so excited and I want to share it all with my best friend.
What.
I'm doing a make-over party.
Well. One of us has to make some money.
And whose fault is that?
Well, what were you doing running around playing the hero?! You had no business fighting demons with her-
Yeah, it was so hot the way you almost got paralyzed.
I was working! You stopped, remember? Everything stopped when you had to save the world-
Well it didn't save her, did it? All it did was ruin our lives.
But you're still up for the day.
At least he has an interest.
(under her breath) If it wasn't for his stock tips we wouldn't be out, eating someplace nice-
You've had too much wine.
I wasn't the one who stopped touching-
What did you expect? You never came near me after Buffy-
Fine. Forget her. Maybe you were just born to be a bitter, angry old man.
No! I want my life back! If I hadn't married you I could have been happy. I wouldn't have had to hate myself for the LAST THIRTY YEARS!
'I promise to cherish you...' Eew, no! "Cherish?" 'I promise to have sex with you whenever...I want, and pledge to be your friend and your wife and your confidant and your sex poodle and--'
Yeah, why?
Huh.
The music! They're playing the music! This is it...
Why? What's wrong?
A C-section?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I am sorry, but what the hell is that minister thinking?
Delivering a baby on my special day! It's totally rude of him and the mother. He should have just told her to hold it!
This bride waits for no one. If the minister's not here yet, well, we'll just have to get married without a minister!
What?
Xander is gone? Xander is missing? WHAT DO YOU MEAN XANDER IS MISSING!
When did you see Xander last?
You. You were talking to Xander right before he left!
What's done?! Did you--? If you said something to make him leave...
Do I know you?
Xander. Where is he?!
I - I didn't do anything.
Tell me what you did with Xander!
No! What did you do to him?
Who. Are. You.
You were... I punished you.
I... I forgot.
But how--
Visions of what?
That's it? That's all you did?
S-stop it.
Xander!
I'm...I'm so glad you're back. It's all lies; what he showed you, it was all made up! He just wanted to break us apart.
We're going to be okay.
STOP IT! EVERYONE SIT DOWN!
You know, it's bad luck for you to see me in my dress.
So, we're ready now. Let's go get married.
But it wasn't real. What he showed you, it wasn't--
What was it? Was it about me? He wants you to hate me, Xander-
Everyone has 'thoughts' Xander. It's natural- it doesn't mean getting married is wrong-
You're just shaken up, okay? Just calm down and then we'll start over. Okay?
I'm tired of crying. I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn.

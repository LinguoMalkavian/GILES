It's such a pain. The text I wanted? Giles took it with him. He has this thing that "owning" a book made it, like, his "property."
Maybe it's cursed. Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
Oh, for crying out loud. This is bizarre. You're all la la with the magic and the not-talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you and now everyone's scared to say anything to you. Except me. Is this that thing I do that you comment on sometimes?
Sweetie, that's a D&amp;D manual.
Let's admit it -we can't find this thing because it doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds.
Great. Someone to do more magic with.
Those are the ones you have to watch out for the most. Responsible types.
I'm serious. Responsible people try so hard to be good all the time - when they get a taste of being bad, they can't get enough. It's like - kablooey!
Okay, not kablooey. More like BAM!
She was getting out of control with it before Tara left. And now that she's gone...
Yes, even the ones that aren't so boring you want to kill yourself.
Lame?
Optimism. I remember optimism.

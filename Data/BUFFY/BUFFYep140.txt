Oops. Sorry, Faith. Didn't realize that was you.
You okay?
He's with me. He's got a soul.
Sort of.
He fights on my side. Which is more than I can say for some of us.
That's one of the bad guys.
Nice to have you back.
Every piece of it's been destroyed and replaced since you left, so, actually, new house.
We've got another new houseguest.
Guys, we need to go to the hospital. A girl was attacked on her way into town. She may be a --
Fine.
You look better.
No, you don't.
I won't. I thought about it some, drew a couple little doodles, but... look... far as I'm concerned, we're on even ground. I meant what I said before -- I don't have time for your vendettas -- but I need you in this fight. I want you on my side.
So we're good.
That makes me feel so much -- What?
You're firing me? I just refrained from kicking your ass!
Right. The big picture of the big war with all the dead little girls.
I don't want to lead them into a war, Robin. War can't be the right thing.
I don't know. These girls... they haven't been tested in battle.
Couldn't I just come to work part- time? I could make flyers for encounter groups and post them around the school. Kids could bring snacks--
Nice to see you two getting on so well.
Yeah...
Right. I kinda... I decided to cut back my hours.
I'm down here! Figure I'm better off focusing on what's going on around here.
He picked you up on the side of the road?
What was it?
We've got a new player in town. Dresses like a preacher. Calls himself Caleb. Looks like he's working for The First.
He's taunting us. Calling us out. Says he has something of mine. Could be another girl. Could be something else. Don't know. Don't care. I'm tired of talking. I'm tired of training. He's got something of mine? Fine. I'm getting it back.
Start arming the girls. I want to be ready to move when we find him.
That's why I figured we'd do a little recon first, see what we can find out. You up for it?
It could be a girl. A potential trying to get to us.
I'm going in anyway.
Then it's time we test 'em. We'll just take the ones who've been with us the longest. The rest can stay here.
I know. That's why I want you to stay with them.
He won't be expecting a full attack. Not this soon. That's why we have to move.
Giles. We don't have time. And you're not going into battle. I need you to stay behind with the others. Help the girls who still need a teacher.
Or something I guess. They're pretty good when they attack.
Well, normally they show up out of nowhere and either stab or get stabbed and then run off. This guy seems like he wants to be found.
I'm through waiting around for people to attack us.
They're potential Slayers. Just like we were.
They're getting better.
Why'd you come back?
No. That's not what I meant. I'm... glad you're here. It's good. Thank you.
Willow told me you helped out Angel.
Really?
How is he?
You were in Angel's mind.
Uh-huh.
So... how much did you and Spike--
Look. There's more of them.
Let's go get the cavalry.
Well, you were always a little slow.
All right, people. Let's saddle up.
Set up a perimeter, guard the door -- I don't want anything getting in behind us. My group'll go in first, check the place out. You guys are our safety net. This thing's a trap, we give the signal and you come in guns blazing after us.
I'm thinking lots and lots of yelling.
Shall we?
'S like an old vineyard or something.
Stay alert. Bringers are here somewhere. We just need to find where they went...
Cover each other's backs... let them come to us...
Save the sermon, padre. Heard you had something of mine.
Xander --
Get them outta here. We have to retreat.
XANDER!

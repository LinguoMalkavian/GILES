Vocal cord wise, yes. With each other, no.
About what?
So?
A spell.
What we did, is done. But I will never kiss you Spike, never touch you, ever, ever again.
You know this guy?
Oh god, what is with you guys? Why kittens? Why can't you use money like normal people?
Then you better close your eyes.
No. Thank you.
If I just stopped saving his life it would simple things up so much.
Uh-huh. What do you mean 'you have to'? You can't ! Giles, this is when I need you. I'm all messed up. Everything is all messed up.
To what? Abandon me, desert me? Leave me all alone when I really need somebody, that's great. That's just really great of you.
Yeah, I know, I know. This hurts you more than it hurts me. And it will be really hard for you over in jolly old England, palling around with all your jolly old friends and riding around in double decker buses or whatever the hell you do there.
So don't. Please don't, okay? I can't do this without you.
But why now? Now that you know where I've been. What I'm dealing with-
So I won't. No giving up. You can be here and I can still be strong. I don't have to depend on you as much as I have.
You're wrong.
Why don't you jump to the chase, Giles? Just tell them that you're-
I'm sorry. Everybody's sorry. And I know you're trying to help me. But it's all too much, Will. The memories, they hurt. I can't take it anymore.
If you understood how it felt - how it feels now... It's like I'm dying in-
Huh.
Hey, don't worry.
It's okay. I don't know anyone here either.
I...nm, I--
Hey, take it easy, guy. No one's hurt, right? And none of us looks all hatchet murder-y, so we're probably safe. Here. Wherever here is.
Maybe that's it. Maybe something magic happened to us.
Listen, it's going to be okay. We'll take care of each other, okay?
Don't worry, me neither. But here...
Of course I do. I just don't happen to know it.
That's sweet, but I think I can name myself. I'll name me.. Joan.
I like it. I feel like a Joan.
Prerogative.
Whatever. 'Umad'.
Boy you're a pain in the neck. DAWN Boy you're bossy.
Sisters.
We've got to figure out what's going on. We need to get help.
We've got a kid here--
A teenager, and we have no idea what's wrong with us. I think a hospital's our best bet.
Any suggestions on how we get there?
Did you see what I--
Monsters are real... Did we know this?
To slay someone. A female someone! Who do those jerks think they are?
Let go 'a me, you big, nasty--
Stay away from Randy!
I don't know.
I think I know why Joan's the boss. I'm like a superhero or something.
Okay, I've got a plan.
They seem to want Randy. And I seem to be pretty strong. Wicked strong. So, while you all go through the sewer and find the hospital, Randy and I'll take the monsters for a run.
Yes.
Alright. You two work on that then. We gotta go. Ready Randy?
Randy!
You don't know who you are.
You're a vampire.
Check out the lumpies... and the teeth.
Oh my god, 'a vampire with a soul'?! How lame is that?
Kinda depends on how long you keep on yakking-- What's that?
Not really. But. Yes.
Note to self: learn to duck.
Don't mess with Joan the Vampire -

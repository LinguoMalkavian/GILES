Whoa...
Non-vampire.
What are you doing here?
Patrolling.
I feel fine. The ground's moving around a little bit, but I like it. It's like a ride.
I'm touched. I have work to do.
But it might kill someone else.
You guys should go find a safer place to be. Like somewhere I'm not.
But I'm still the Slayer. And as long as I am, Angel's not going to kill anyone else.
Ahh!
That helps.
I told you guys to leave. This is my fight. You don't have to...
Heyyy... here were are. It's all of we! Are we taking me home?
Yes, lie at home. My bed is better than any bed that's not my bed.
Shhh! Hospital zone. No singing.
No. Let me go.
Let me go!
Giles, tell them. The vampires. I've got to kill the vampires!
They're out there!
I want to go home.
Please don't make me stay. Not here.
Ow...
Who?
Power Girl to the rescue!
You're safe now.
Coulda fooled me...
Well, good. Thanks for having me and let's try to keep in touch.
Good Hmmm or bad Hmmm?
Nope.
So I should go.
Is that what Tina had?
These are balloons.
Homework.
You know, chocolate says that even better.
Chocolate means nothing to me.
Well, not really. Some stuff happened, I'm wondering...
Now this part I could get used to.
Stuff, yeah. You know a girl died here last night.
Well, that flu.
Well, there's this Dr. Backer, he's been giving them experimental treatments -- he's kinda creepy -- I'm not sure what he's up to. And then I met this kid, Ryan. He said he saw something.
Death.
But I thought I saw something -- I was out of it, I'm not sure, but.
Look, maybe it wasn't death. Maybe it was something else.
This has nothing to do with that. This kid Ryan was afraid of something. Something real. As long as I'm forced to stay here, I wanna find out what.
Hi. Remember me?
Why not?
Oh, I already got what you got.
Ryan, listen to me. I'm not gonna let this thing hurt you. Any of you.
I know.
It's not him. Backer was clean.
He's dead. This thing killed him. And not with kindness.
No, it was invisible. I saw Backer nearly shredded and the thing knocked me down. It's real. Which means I get to fight it.
Yeah, but I was pretty delirious... I mean, why would I see it then and not last night?
I have to stay here.
I think my symptoms are flaring up again.
'Cause I'm not well. I feel oogy.
Yeah. Just for another day...
Giles, let's get a mug shot on this guy. I kneed to know who I'm fighting.
I'll check Backer's office. See if there are any post-its marked 'Why a monster might want me dead.'
If I do find something, I probably won't have the slightest idea what it means, so, Willow...
I never have.
Yeah. Right. Go.
Know something soon.
Yet another person I wasn't in time to save. I wish Angel had put me in the hospital sooner. There's a sentence I never expected to say.
Yeah?
Would that work?
Who is this?
Where's Giles?
Well, can you put him on?
Right.
So it did kill Tina?
Backer was curing the kids -- and taking away the Kindestod's food.
What?
Hanging on every 'ew.'
Celia?
I don't know what to do! Celia!
I've got to get this thing, Willow. Before it gets those kids.
But how? I can't even see it!
Did I? Maybe my mind was playing with me. I mean, I was crazed with that fever and--
I am. Lots of thoughts.
The fever. That's how you see the Kindestod. That's why Celia could see it. That's why Ryan still can. It's the only way.
I guess we'll find out.
Willow, I'm doing this--
They should put that on the label.
This is going to have to work fast.
I'm not sure this was such a great idea.
Okay... I'm okay.
I don't know. Maybe I'm too late. Maybe they were moved. I don't want to think about the other maybe.
I think it's in there.
I'm fine. Really.
No!
We have to get to the basement.
I thought I might try violence.
You make me sick.
And the winner is...
Actually, I'm starting to feel better.
And the juice?
That's my drink.
I wanted crunchy style.
And, um, I ordered extra jelly.
It's from Ryan.
What are you doing here?

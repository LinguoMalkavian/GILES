Get the sign? I doubt she'll see the sign. Why's it so, like, pale?
We've heard the crayon speech a lot. I mean, it's great, of course...
Yeah, it's gonna be weird seeing her again. I love her and everything, but how do you... what do you say to someone in this situation?
Oh come on, are you saying it isn't going to be strange? We saw her kill someone. She was about to kill Dawn!
Just that, she kinda didn't finish.
He said it was important for her to come back early, and she's been doing really well and we shouldn't worry.
What?
... absolutely said he put her on the plane in London.
Or she doubled back, got off the plane after Giles left, in London.
Well I hope you're right, because defeating Lazy Willow, probably less hard.
Good idea.
Upstairs.
I checked with Giles again too. He hasn't heard from her.
With extra wig. I think he's blaming himself pretty hard. Like, he should've known she wasn't ready. I kept telling him it wasn't his fault. I mean, maybe it was something about us she couldn't face...
Undoubtedly. But you do have a point.
If Willow's flipped out, it's her bad. We can only be here for her so much if she won't be; you know, here .
No skin.
And yet my eyes refuse to look away. Stupid eyes.
I gotta find a job where I'm not the one called right away for this stuff.
Take what back?
It would mean we lost her again.
I think I hear him.
Spike. Spike .
Yeah. You scared me a little, in the church. I'm... I had to think. I didn't know what to think.
We need to know who did it. Who skinned the boy out there?
Spike, please...
This isn't the time.
We might as well go.
Willow. He's talking about Willow.
Well, it doesn't exactly make it less likely. Maybe he saw her.
Spike, is there something here? Something that killed?
Right. He also mentioned tadpoles. We're not going to jump to conclusions about those either, one way or the other.
She knows about viscera. Makes you proud.
I need to do something. And I just, I have this feeling in my gut...
...that we already know exactly who did this. And that all this work, it's just us trying to talk ourselves into thinking Willow's all right.
See ?
I don't know, Dawn. You're new at this, and I get why you're proud of finding this, but I don't see why this guy is any more likely than all the others.
What?
There were lots of spatters, no pool.
Dawn? How come you're so okay with this? With the blood and the strips of skin...
Well, you are very alarming and also helpful. Thank you.
Or we could be smart. Sorry, Xander.
Whoever did this, they had to get blood on them. And they'd leave a trail...
And we have a way to track it.
Yeah, let's tie ourselves to the crazy vampire!
It's pretty easy. Spike follows the exciting smell of blood. We follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike.
Wow, that was so close to being empowered.
This is a rock cliff.
It's hard to protect yourself, going in head-first like that.
Yay for being the strong one. It's so much fun.
Shh. Listen.
Guess we're in the right place.
It's echoing around. He sounds close, guys but he's way at the other--
Dawn, you okay?
Dawn! We gotta get her out of here.
The computer. The thing Dawn was reading may have an antidote for the paralysis.
What?
That's okay.
Just like you said it would... so good on you.
Helpful. You were helpful.
Right. No need for that.
What?! I'm not going to tell them you're drunk! For God's sake, Dawn.
Watch her head, watch her head.
Sofa.
I'm looking for the page with the info on this thing... see if there's an antidote.
I can't find the right... okay... (fast, run-together) Gnarl blah blah skin blah blah yuck... got it. It says the paralysis is permanent.
No. Wait. Permanent 'til the creature dies. Sorry.
We have to go back.
Do you think she'd vomit?
We'll call Anya. She'll stay with her.
She's not dying. She's just paralyzed.
Hey!
She's posable?
Where'd you get those nuts?
I don't think-- You saw Willow?
Listen. This is important. Did she go to the cave ?
Xander, she could be there. Willow could be trapped with the Gnarl.
This monster, Gnarl, you know stuff about him?
You're coming with us.
Hurry!
Where is Willow? What did you do to her?
I don't know. But I'm starting to get why we haven't seen her.
I'm getting the feeling that whatever caused this invisibility thing or whatever, it's a whole separate issue from this skin-eating mon--
Willow? Are you here?
Willow?
Willow? Willow, I can't see you, but... But I'm so glad you're back, and... I don't know how badly you're hurt...
Willow, it's okay. You'll be okay.
I didn't mean-- Sorry to interrupt.
Didn't realize meditating was such hard work.
That-- Wow. This is magic, right? When most people meditate they don't get extra skin, do they? Cuz Clem should, like, cut back.
We're on the second floor.
Huh. Explains why my fingernails get dirty even when I don't do anything.
Oh, right.
We missed you too. I missed you. Dawn's been working on what caused the mutual no-see-ums, but I don't--
You did a spell?
And you made it happen.
Well, I get that. It's okay.
I have a confession. I thought it might be you. With the flaying.
I want to be the kind of person that wouldn't think that. Xander never thought that.
I thought you were too tired.
I'm so sorry.
Me, I got so much strength I'm givin' it away.
Will it help?
Good.
Get the sign? I doubt she'll see the sign. Why's it so, like, pale?

You're probably wondering what I'm doing with this stuff.
It's actually... show-and-tell! For history class. Mr. Giles has this, like, hobby. A hobby of collecting stuff. Which he lent me. For show-and-tell. Did I mention it's for history class?
I don’t even like chocolate. (to herself) Well, that was the lamest comeback of our times...
Bribery. She’s desperate to be the May Queen.
Okay, it’s fun that we’re speaking in tongues...
I was.
At my old school.
I mean, we didn’t call it May Queen, but we had the dance, and the coronation, all that stuff. It was nice.
Mitch, what happened?
What hit you?
I better check out the scene.
Maybe. All I know is it’s a message.
And monsters don’t usually send messages. It’s pretty much, “kill, crush, destroy”. This is different.
I love it when you say that. Any theories?
It’s not like anyone ever sits close enough to overhear us. Come on. Give.
Angry is right. It was a real scene in that locker room.
I suppose so. Willow, why don’t you compile a list of kids who’ve died here who might have turned into ghosts.
It’s all part of the glamorous world of vampire slaying.
Finding out what I can about Mitch. This attack wasn’t random.
Fine. Ask around. Talk to his friends. Talk to Cordelia.
Cordelia. Can I talk to you?
What happened?
How can you say that?...
Okay, I know someone’s here. I just want to talk to you. I won’t hurt you.
Yikes.
Maybe.
Giles, have you ever touched a ghost?
We were talking about touching.
Okay, this is my problem. I touched the thing. It didn’t go through me, it bumped into me. And it wasn’t cold.
A girl. She spoke. She said Harmony deserved what she got.
This girl’s sort of petty, for a God.
Is Cordelia.
First thing tomorrow, pull up that missing kids list. Maybe this girl’s made herself invisible for long enough for someone to notice she’s gone.
Good.
I think Cordelia’s gonna be working on the May Queen decorations. There might be some action. It’s time for me to start the hunt.
Hello? Invisible person?
I know you’re here. I know I can’t see you. It’s a good trick. Care to teach it to me?
Did you guys just hear something?
Last night was a bust. But I still think Cordy’s the key here.
Good work.
Whoa, check it out. the most recent one. Marcie Ross... disappeared almost six months ago.
Well, her only activity was band. She played the flute.
I heard a flute last night, when I was hunting. I couldn’t find out where it was coming from.
Sad. Real sad. But it was the band room where I lost Ms. Invisible yesterday... This tracks. I’ve got a free now, I’ll check it out.
Okay. There’s something about this room. We keep coming back. What is it?
It, I presume...
Marcie Ross. So it is you...
It looked like Marcie’s been there for months. It’s where I found this.
Check it out.
“Have a nice summer” is what you write when you have nothing to say.
And you guys didn’t know Marcie Ross?
‘Cause you both wrote it too.
But you don’t remember her.
And you never noticed her. And now she’s invisible...
And with the Hellmouth below us sending out mystical energy --
It isn’t this great power she can control, it’s something that was done to her. That we did to her.
Just what we thought.
Cordelia.
So you’re coming to me for help? There’s a Why? inside me screaming to get out.
Cordelia, the attacker is an invisible girl.
It’s not that simple. It’s a
Well, Marcie remembers you.
I’m not sure we’re supposed to, yet. Marcie’s not quite ready. From what she did to Cordelia’s picture, I’d say she’s wigged on the whole May Queen thing. Maybe she’s going to do something about it, but at a time of her choosing.
She has a point.
Anyway, continuing the normal May Queen activities is probably the best way to draw Marcie out. Cordelia is our bait.
A sitting duck Come on.
OK, I think it’s clear.
That about sums it up.
Oh, so you’ve read about that feeling?
If you feel so alone, why do you work so hard to be popular?
Your secret dies with me.
Looks okay. But hurry.
You know, what you were saying before... I understand. It doesn’t matter how popular you are --
In L.A. That point is, I did sort of feel like something was missing --
Okay, can we have the heartfelt talk with less talk from you? Cordelia?
Cordelia!
Yeah.
Neither can I.
What do you mean?
I don’t know.
I don’t know.
Why don’t you explain it? What are we supposed to learn?
Marcie... you can’t do this.
Marcie, you know it’s wrong...
Just hold still -
You know, I really felt bad for you. You’ve suffered. But there’s one thing I didn’t factor into all this. You’re a thundering loony.
I see you...
Take what from where?
Well, where were you ten minutes ago when she was playing surgeon?
You can cure her?
This isn’t the first time this has happened, is it? This has happened at other schools.
Do you guys know that you’re very creepy?
I just can’t believe how twisted Marcie got. How did you guys get out of the boiler room?
I’ll say.
Hey.
That’s okay.

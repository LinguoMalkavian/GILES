Hey.
Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays.
I don't feel very right. They blame me for stuff, and honestly? I can't say they're wrong.
What do you even mean?
Oh... watch me.
And the difference is?
No.
You really have trouble with that word, don't you?
I've actually been aware of that for some time.
Can, maybe. Should? I don't know I'm so tired...
Well, I --
It is?
How do you mean?
Sounds dire.
Really? I mean, I'm not glad of that...
That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies. Every time.
Casualties... it sounds so casual. These are girls. That I got killed.
And I can't fault them for kicking me out. I've been... I've just cut myself off from them, all of them. 'Cause I knew I was gonna lose some of them, and I didn't want to...
Please, Spike. We never got close. That's why you wanted me -- 'cause I was unattainable.
I don't want to go over the --
Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.
Thank you. That helped.
Well what are you trying to say?
Okay, I'm attainable. I'm an attainathon. Can I sleep now?
I don't... I don't want to be the one.
Spike?
No. I mean... here. Would you just... hold me?
I hear you've got something of mine.
So where's it at? I'm gonna find it sooner or later.
So lay a hand on me. If you can.
Y'know, you should really watch your language. Someone who didn't know you might think you were a woman- hating prick.

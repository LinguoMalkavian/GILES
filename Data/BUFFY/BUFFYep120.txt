What happened?
Sure. How'd I get here?
Willow?
What's wrong?
What? Why?
Willow. We need to stop. I don't like this-
And we'll catch him - and he'll go to jail. Believe me, I'm finding the whole getting shot very motivating. But you're using magic-
Maybe. But this isn't right. It isn't how I want it-
And you do have a choice. This isn't good for you, Will-
Will! Wait-
Willow - NO!
And then what?
Will. Stop. You need to calm down-
You're angry. I am too. What Warren did, there's no excuse, but-
Oh my God-
No... Oh God, Tara...
No. Come on, stop-
We love you. And Tara. But we don't kill humans. This isn't the way-
I know... And I... I can't believe... anything. Not what happened - not what you must be going through. But if you do this - Warren destroys you too.
Don't. Please. We'll get through this together-
Willow-
Willow?
I left there hours ago. She'd be back by now.
Dawny?
Oh... God.
Dawn... Hey... Let's go downstairs.
I know, honey. I don't either.
The police left?
We need to find Willow.
Dawn, don't say that-
Because you don't really feel that way-
Xander-
Being the slayer doesn't give me a license to kill. Warren's human.
So the human world has it's own rules for dealing with people like him-
Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. We can't control the universe. If we were supposed to, the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does. And we'd be able to bring Tara back...
There are limits to what we can do. There should be. Willow doesn't want to believe it - and now she's messing with forces that want to hurt her. All of us.
I know. And now it has to stop. Warren's going to get what he deserves. I promise you. But I won't let Willow destroy herself.
Maybe the magic shop. There could be some kind of locating spell... (quickly/to Xander) I can go alone, if you-
Dawny can't stay here-
No, honey, it's too dangerous-
She does. And you'll help her. Lots. But first we have to get her home in one piece.
Dawn. I'm serious. You've been through enough for one - ever. Okay? You should be somewhere you'll feel safe.
Alright.
Xander.
He'd never hurt Dawn. He physically can't. And he wouldn't-
She feels safe with him. We don't have a choice, Xander. Right now - he's all we've got.
Spike-
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you-
I spilled your snacks.
We were looking for Spike, actually.
Tell me what?
Oh.
We're fine, thanks. But you could do us a favor... You think Dawn could hang out here with you for a while? I have some stuff to do and I don't want her to be alone.
Dawn. I told you why. What do you think?
I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.
Thank you.
Are you okay? Did Willow - ?
A spell?
Oh.
She wants to do it herself.
Anya. We don't have much time. Which side of this are you on?
What's happening? What do you feel?
Let's move.
Willow - no... What did you do?

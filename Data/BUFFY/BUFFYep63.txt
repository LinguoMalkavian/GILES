Hey guys. Ooh, look. It's my late night stormtrooper pal.
That's your man.
Nope. I am going to a party tonight. Hopefully, a "no fighting, no biting" kind of deal.
Giles, I'm in a dorm now filled with what the young people these days call "young people". The girls in my hall want to party, I'm taking Willow, try to cheer her up.
... The black hole of despair she's lived in since Oz left? She's dealing, I'm helping. It's hard. Ergo, party.
(re: sketch) Look. No horns, no claws, no slime. The bad guy's just a guy, so you two can take patrol. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to pick out something slutty for tonight.
Stupid pen...
You know, for someone who teaches human behavior? You might try showing some.
That's right. A human being in pain has nothing to do with your job.
Looks cool.
'Cause we could go...
Hey! Our whole dorm is here, of course. You wanna...?
You want me to --
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ask away.
Business. Right, Excuse us?
Doesn't Spike get that this is my town?
And it's my night off!
What's that supposed to mean?
Riley's a doof. He's not Teutonic.
Fine. He's worn out his welcome. Tonight, I kill him.
I am the plan. If Spike wants me? I go alone, lead him away from the popular spots, and give him what he wants.
A flare gun? Xander, if I see Spike I'm staking him, not signaling ships at sea.
I'll flare.
Riley! What are you doing here?
Who, Xander? Oh, he's not ... anyone I want to talk about. You know, I don't want you taking this the wrong way, but I need a little alone time now. Alone.
I need space.
I mean emotionally.
Whoa! It's a free campus. Who died and made you John Wayne?
You think I need help? Believe me, I don't. And if you were a real gentleman you would go. Far, far away by now. Well? Go on. Shoo!
Yes. Report me.
Maybe I'm taking you home, ever thought of that? What is it, you think boys can take care of themselves and girls need help?
Oh, that is so Teutonic.
And as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
See ya.
Go.
Hi.
No, I was rude -
Just felt like being alone. Sometimes, at night, it's nice to be out by yourself.
Oh yeah.
Okay. 'Course that stupid fraternity prank on our hall didn't help any.
How'd you know that?
Really? That work out?
Was there something -- at the party, you wanted to tell me something?
You're a little peculiar.
See ya.

Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before everything else-
It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing before... I felt it. It was ancient and... enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue Spike soon, who knows what else The First will get him to do.
Dawn-
Just - he'll come to when he comes to... Keep reading, okay? If we want to help Spike, we need to know how to fight this thing.
Hand me the Watcher's Codex again?
Mom?
You're The First.
No-
Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.
What?
Did you see it?
Oh.
Nothing. It was nothing.
What?
No, I-
For the time being. But if you don't tell us what we need to know - I'm going to offer you to The First on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.
Hey. I was intimidating here.
Forget it. Where's the Seal?
Better be right this time.
What does it do?
The Seal could have been activated. Maybe that's what The First wanted Spike for.
Guys-
I'm not sure. The First was camped underground last time I found it, but who knows-
Hey-
Pills. DAWN Cream.
Anyway I'm all better now.
That's some full service Principal- ing. Wow.
Oh. And... I was just down here helping Dawnie with her project.
We buried a... time capsule.
Okay. We'd better go.
Right. Sorry about that. I've just been ill and... stuff.
No problem. I'll be back tomorrow. One-hundred percent ooze-free me.
Dawn's trying to find anything she can on the Seal of Danzalthar and Will's going to do a locator spell, see if she can find The First.
I couldn't sleep. Too much going on.
You didn't see The First. I did. I felt it. This thing is-
Will-
It's not, it's gone. You're okay.
I won't. You're okay. We just, we won't use magic to fight this thing. Not until we know what we're doing.
I'm going alone.
It's out there - and it's hurting my friends. I'll find it-
Giles?
The others were murdered.
The First - that's what it wants.
And then Faith. Then me. And with all the potentials gone, and no way of making another... It's the end. There's no more Slayer. Ever.
Can we gag him?
And that's what this claims to be?
No, she's not wrong. We should have more muscle. That's why we have to find Spike.
Under it. There was a hidden cavern, happened to be under a tree lot. Those Bringer guys were doing some kind of ritual.
I didn't even realize it was December. Maybe when we get home we should decorate the rubble. You think you'll ever show up for a real visit? The kind where the world isn't about to end?
Good. 'Cause I miss you.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
Peachy. Except my knees bend backwards now. Stay up there, Giles. I'll check it out.
What was it?
Don't want to wake the others just yet, give us a chance to...
I'm fine. Got in a fight, is all.
You mean not in front of the Next Generation?
No. It's still out there. Somewhere.
All of us dead.
No sleep today. Can't.
Comes with the gig. I don't think taking on pre-historic evil involves nap time.
I have the best plan ever.
You know, maybe the First isn't ready for modern technology... "Results one through ten out of nine hundred thousand, five hundred, seventeen." Okay. I gotta narrow this down - I'll call you back.
I know it's not the all-time most Kosher use of office hours, but, uh, I'm facing a little downtime here and what can I say? I just love those evil, evil movies. Like "The Exorcist" or "Blair Witch".
Different evil.
Well, this isn't for the kids...
What kind of movies do you like?
"You've looked better," thank you, so much Mr. Principal sir...
It's okay, Mom.
No. Mom, I can't.
I don't have time.
Everyone's counting on me.
Something Evil is coming.
I have to stop it.
I, I don't know. Yet, but...
I'm sorry. What were we talking about?
No. I'm different. I'm, I'm hip and relate to the young people. Don't go, uh, uh...
Roger. See, I knew that.
You'll be okay.
No one expects you to make everything right.
Don't, okay?
I'll be okay. Okay or better. It's like my guarantee.
I don't know.
Better load 'em up.
And this will help us how?
And, when were you ever good before ?
How we doing on time?
Just hope I'm calling the right ones.
Oh, Giles. Not what I really needed to hear right...
We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll come. Can't run, can't hide... can't pretend it's not the end 'cause it is. Something has always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First.
I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of Hell and it's going to swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me.
Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before everything else-

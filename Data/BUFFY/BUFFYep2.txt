Where's Jesse?
Which way?
Jesse... BLACK OUT.
And vampires...
You are sitting down.
He loves doing this part.
You don't. I do.
Jesse's my responsibility. I let him get taken.
Breathe...
Breathe. This big guy, Luke, he talked about an offering to the Master. I don't know who or what, but if they weren't just feeding, Jesse may still be alive. I'm gonna find him.
They couldn't handle it if they did come. They'd only show up with guns.
I looked around, but... soon as they got clear of the woods they could have just --whoom.
They can drive.
Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get anywhere in town without catching any rays. I didn't see any access around there, though.
We so don't have time.
There's nothing here. This is useless!
He didn't come out of nowhere. He came from behind me. I was facing the entrance. He came from behind me and he didn't follow me out. The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum.
The girl must have doubled back with Jesse after I got out. God, I'm so mentally challenged!
There's no 'we'. Okay? I'm the Slayer, and you're not.
Xander, this is deeply dangerous.
Welcome to the new world.
Then I'm out of here. If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.
We? I? Me?
No! I'm just ... admiring the fence. This is quality fencework.
Mr. Giles!
He asked me to get a book for him. From the store 'cause I have a free period and I'm a big reader did it mention that on my transcripts?
Ask him.
We're clear.
I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
Why not?
How could that possibly be?
I'm sorry you had to wait. Look, if you're gonna be popping up with this cryptic wise man act on a regular basis, can you at least tell me your name?
Angel. It's a pretty name.
Deal with my going.
If this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why don't you stop it?
I've got a friend down there -- or, a potential friend. Do you know what it's like to have a friend?
That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.
You gonna wish me luck?
Xander! What are you doing here?
I understand. Now go away.
That'll get it done.
Good thinking.
Turn that off!
What else what?
Oh, yeah. There was this one time, I was pinned down by this vampire, he played left tackle for the varsity -- I mean, before he was... well anyway he's got one of those really thick necks and all I've got is a little Exacto knife -- You're not loving this story.
They're close
No rats.
Oh, no...
Hold on.
Oops.
Do you know another way out?
I don't think this is the way out.
Xander! The cross!
Help me!
We need to get out of here.
Come on!
Go!
UP !
Worse.
I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they were waiting for us.
So, Giles, you got anything that can make this day worse?
I knew I could count on you.
He came 'cause this town is a mystical whoosit?
Bring the demons back.
So, I dust anyone sporting this look, and no Harvest.
Any clue where this little get-together is being held?
I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
Supplies.
I have to.
I was quiet.
I was... running an errand.
Mom, I promise you, it's not gonna be like before. But I have to go.
Mom...
This is important.
Mom, I don't have time to talk about it--
It's locked.
Well, I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!
Not this thing. You guys try the back entrance. I'll find my own way.
Guys!
The Vessel...
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle something.
You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?
Okay, Vessel-boy. You want blood?
Then come and get it.
How'd it taste?
There's something you forgot about, too.
Sunrise.
It's in about nine hours, moron.
Well, we averted the apocalypse. You gotta give us points for that.
Well, what exactly were you expecting?
Believe me, I've seen it happen.
I can hardly wait.
Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.
I was aiming for a subtle approach, like excessive not studying.

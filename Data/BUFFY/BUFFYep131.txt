We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
I need to find him as soon as possible. He's not answering any of his numbers.
You don't need to get all British and dodgy, Mr. Travers. I know you have ways of finding him.
Can I do anything?
Here --
He's been feasting on humans for weeks. I think he's in major withdrawal. We need to get him some blood.
No... we should probably ween him off humans. He'll have to make do with animal blood.
You don't mind?
Thank you.
He's in bad shape. He's past the point where he can tell me anything.
I'll be okay.
It's fine. He hasn't started talking yet.
Better?
You were in pretty bad withdrawal.
Oh. Nothing?
When did your chip stop working?
How about the losing time? How long's that been going on?
You got your soul.
How'd you do it? How'd you get it back?
Just like that.
Of sorts?
Meaning?
How can you say that?
You feeling sorry for yourself, Spike? That what this is about?
Yes.
You figured this out just now?
Violence. William the Bloody now has insight into violence.
Excuse me a second.
Everything okay?
Okay.
Who are you talking to?
I heard you talking in here. Who were you talking to?
Are you okay?
Spike...
He didn't seem to want anything to do with me. He just knocked me aside and charged at the wall.
I don't know. Spike and I were talking, and he was fine -- well, he wasn't fine, but he was... Spike -- and then I went to check on you guys and when I came back it was like he was... ..a completely different person...
He was talking to someone up there -- I heard him through the door. He was having a conversation... And then he started singing.
Spike mentioned a song when we were in the cellar. He changed there, too. Instantly became another person.
Spike's been saying he's been seeing things since I found him in the basement...
This trigger... how do we holster... or I mean, safety... I don't know guns. How do we make it stop?
All right -- I need information. If Spike's a bomb I need to know how to diffuse him.
Well, you took a good bite out of Andrew --
Tucker's brother.
But he'll live.
It's okay.
We think we know what's wrong with you.
What?
No, you don't understand. When I left the room earlier, I heard you talking to --
I was in the cellar with you. I saw what you did.
Believe me, I'm well aware what you're capable of.
Something is playing with you, Spike. This isn't your fault. You're not doing this.
We can keep you locked up. Give us time and we can --
You fought by my side. You've saved lives, helped --
No...
You don't have any idea what you're talking about.
I don't hate myself, Spike . Not anymore. You think you have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? You don't know me.
You're not alive because of pain. You're not alive because of hate. You're alive because I saw you change. I see your penance.
There's a man in there underneath that monster. A man who -- even when he had no soul --
-- struggled to find redemption. You're alive because I know he's in there --
-- and I believe in the man he can be.
Dawn?
Spike --
They were going after Spike all along.
I know these guys...
I have to admit, though. This way's much more fun.

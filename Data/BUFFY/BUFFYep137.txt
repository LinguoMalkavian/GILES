Chloe? It is Chloe, right?
And if I find out you've been fighting again, I'll, um... bang your heads together.
The Hellmouth below us is starting its semi-annual percolation. Usually blows around May.
We're a little ahead of schedule.
You forgot snappy dresser.
Yeah. It is.
What is it?
Wow. A Slayer keepsake. I couldn't.
Until now.
An emergency kit. I don't know what to say.
Thank you, Principal Wood.
Um, here we are.
... So all these Potential Slayers, who just seemed to sprout up from like every corner of the planet, were getting killed.
Agents of. We thought the Council could protect them, but no one was protecting the Council and all their Watchers were killed. Since then, word got out, and they've all been coming here since.
It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is it: command central.
Principal Wood, meet Andrew.
This is Andrew. He's our... actually, he's our hostage.
He was evil, people died, now he bakes. It's a thing.
Andrew, we don't have a big board.
You'll have to forgive Andrew. Or not. Your call. We've got a little more than the big board working for us, anyway.
An ally.
You're right. It's not enough.
They're not recruits. Recruits are recruited. These girls were more like... Chosen.
They're not all gonna make it. Some will die. And nothing I can do will stop that.
Will, it's okay, he knows.
I've been showing him around.
Literal. Remind me to be polite with her.
I dunno, it's just, The First is coming, and look at us. "The Army." We've got fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who mostly won't-a and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts.
Figured.
I'm showing him, you know, the way we do things. Our operation. Us.
He's joking.
We'd better get back upstairs.
And?
I didn't know that was possible. Anything we can use?
They're worse than the French. Anything else?
Good. Keep on it. And don't you have any real homework?
Dawn. Get a knife. I'm cutting her down.
You're not Chloe.
Don't listen to it. Any of you.
We'll be here.
W-what's T.T.F.N.?
Dawn. Where's that knife?
Everyone here?
Anyone like to say a few words about Chloe?
You're new here. And you're wrong, because I use the power I've got. The rest of you are all just waiting for me.
Well from now on, I'm your leader as in "do what I say."
Then why are you here? Besides getting rescued, what do you do?
You're here because you're scared.
Fine. Anya, all of you: be as scared as you like. Just be useful while you're at it.
And The First isn't impressed. It already knows us. Knows everything we can do, and it's laughing. You want to surprise the enemy? Surprise yourselves. Force yourselves to do what can't be done or else we're not an army. Just a bunch of girls waiting to be picked off and buried.
Take a cell phone. That way, if I need someone to get weepy or wailed on, I'll call you.
Just said it.
Keep holding back, Spike, and you might as well walk out that door.
Since you got your soul back?
You were a better fighter then.
What I want is the Spike who's dangerous. The one who tried to kill me when we met.
I'm nowhere near him.
Declare an emergency.
We thought you might want to be here.
"You can't watch, you have to see." See what?
I saw her.
The other night, in a dream. It's got to mean something. Let's find out what. Time for a puppet show.
What about darkness?
Means I have to go in there.
That's the point.
It's closing. I've gotta go.
Find a way!
Well. Guess that worked.
Hello?
Good. That's good then and I know we've got bigger issues to deal with but how'd I understand a word you just said?
Okay, and the "neat" of it just left me. End of what?
Latest. You mean "latest" guardian.
Look - I got a First to fight. You three have clearly had some time on your hands. Tell me what I need to know. I came to learn.
Okay, know what I think? I'm not really here at all. None of this is actually happening, this is like a play, like a shadow play, like a non- reality re-enactment hologrammy...
What is this?
I thought I brought me here.
This is how you...
Bastards...
I get a say in this and I'm saying no...
No!
Make this stop.
You got the wrong Slayer. I'm not the first one.
How many times I have to tell you? I'm already the Slayer!
I know that now. But you guys? You're just... men.
Good.
Please. I died more times than you can count.
I think you forgot one thing about power.
So tell me something I don't know.
Thanks for bringing me back. Again.
Will?
Not this time. Will: The men I met. The Shadow Men. They showed me.
That the Primitive was right. It isn't enough.

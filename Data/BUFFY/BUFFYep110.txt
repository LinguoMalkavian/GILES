When... When did the building fall down?
Oh. Oh my God.
Shoe. I need my shoe.
The hurry is, I left Dawn all night and don't call me "luv."
Can we - not? Talk?
What do you think is going to happen, Spike? We're gonna read the paper together? Play footsie under the... rubble?
Stop-
No. No. I have to...
Oh, God...
What? That's what this was about? "Doing" a slayer?
Shut up-
No. A vampire got me hot. One . But he's gone. You're just convenient.
Right. Because I came back all wrong... Know what's really wrong with me? You.
Get a grip, Spike. Like you're God's gift-
Let me go-
You're bent-
I swear, if you ever tell anyone about this, I will kill you .
I'm fine-
I'm not. Sore. I just had a... fight, all-nighter kind of deal.
No. I think you guys are safe. Tara was here.
You guess? Where were you?
Oh.
No, I know. It's... I mean, it wasn't intentional. And everybody's safe. You are, right? You're okay?
Me too. I'm kind of...
You sure you're alright? I'm sorry. About everything.
Right. Thanks.
What's up?
Hey. This is fascinating, really, but we've got work to do-
Can I weigh in on the whole me wearing of larva-
Guys! Please. There's something out there-
No. No Spike. And we don't need to hit streets. We just need to stay put, away from... distractions. We'll figure it out.
Maybe, but she's home sleeping.
She was out late. With Amy.
It's not like that. Willow's just... trying to help Amy through the transition-
Willow's a grown up. Maybe she shouldn't be monitored-
I didn't say that, I just...
Hello?
Willow? Dawn?
What are you doing here-
Where's Willow?
What is this?
That is what I think it is. What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?
So they didn't let you in.
What else did you take?
What else?
Understands what? Breaking into people's houses for kitchen spices? I don't think so.
Rack's.
She's there? With Dawn?
Tell me where this place is and I won't.
What do you mean "it moves?"
So how do I find it?
God. Do you sleep through anything? I was, like, yelling, and nothing-
Get dressed. Dawn's missing.
She went out with Willow-
Spike. Willow's into something. She and Dawn have been missing for hours. There's some guy called Rack-
He's some kind of-
I've been all over downtown and I can't find his place-
So let's go.
Anything?
I swear to God, Spike, if you're dragging this out-
Like you've never drawn things out before-
Will you quit with that! The only thing different is that I'm disgusted with myself. That's the power of your charms. The other night was the most perverse, degrading experience of my life-
Well maybe you get off on it, but it's not my style-
Not love-
I want you out of my life, Spike. Out of my work, my house-
Forget it. I'll find Dawn myself-
Dawn!
Your arm. Let me see-
Okay. Come on, let's get you to a doctor-
Back off, Will. We've got her-
I mean it. Stay away ifrom her.
Get up.
Yeah, you screwed up! You could have killed her! You almost did-
You can.
Sleeping. The ER doc gave her something for the pain. It knocked her out.
It's a fracture. It takes time, but...
I just - I don't understand. Why you'd go to somebody like Rack. And why you'd drag Dawn into it.
So what happened?
Why? Because of Tara?
But everything seemed to be going so well...
Will, there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need magic to be special-
You were more than "some girl". And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you-
I know that. I promise you.
I get that. More than you... But it's wrong. People get hurt.
I know.
Good. I think it's right. To give it up. No matter how great it feels-
Hard - but not impossible. We'll be here for each other.
Right.
Well, see, I don't have to now.
Exactly. It's over. From now on it's goodbye impulse - hello impulse control.

Or as normal as this school ever sees.
Well, no fires, nobody's head's gone ka-blooey. And the marching band and swing choir have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.
I saw an army of Ubervamps. In my vision. An army was going to rise up from the Hellmouth. From that Seal. To think I stopped The First... It can't be that easy.
Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying. Those are the easy ones.
Your mother?
Gotta tell ya, not a line every girl likes to hear. But, in this case - compliment taken.
Giles -- what's wrong?
So. I didn't stop it then.
Giles --
Did you bring back more Potentials?
Spike? What about him?
Military put a chip in Spike's brain so he couldn't hurt anyone.
He has a soul now, Giles. Spike won't let himself harm anyone.
The trigger's a post-hypnotic deal The First put in his head. Made him... He was killing again.
It was killing him, Giles.
The chip. The trigger's not working anymore.
It's that song. I'm sure it has to do with that song he was singing.
I dunno. I mean... Not like it had a catchy hook or anything, like, "I'm Comin' Up So You Better Get This Party Started." It was boring, old, and English. Just like yo-- --ul. Brynner. Yul Brynner. A... British Yul Brynner.
Spike --
Listen to me. It's okay. Spike?
You all right?
Don't you think you should take a little time first. To calm down.
She'll be okay. She's tough.
I'm going to unchain him.
Giles, this is pointless. He doesn't know anything. Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
Is something wrong?
Could use a little of that... Okay. Guess now's as good a time as we're likely to see for a while. Just hurry back.
I dunno, Giles. Is this really primo time for a training session?
You're talking to me like I'm sixteen again.
In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, not sure how I feel about Robin looking after Spike at his place.
GILES We are on the verge of war. It's time to start looking at the big picture.
Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day I gave an inspirational speech to the telephone repairman.
Have you seen me with those girls? The way I've treated my friends and family? And Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make the hard decisions.
What? Why not?
Sure. Why not. Seems like a nice enough guy.
No problem. You from around here?
Hey, I'm just saying -- if he's gonna save the world, we should get to know him a little better.
Hi, Rich.
We've had this conversation before, Giles. When I told you I wouldn't sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory from destroying the world.
If I have to. To save the world... Yes.
Have you heard my speeches?
Yes. I get it.
Spike's here because I want him here. We need him. I'm in the fight of my life.
Not you, Richard.
It's different. He has a soul now.
Exactly. The First's doing this. Spike's innocent.
Ben?
Glory. I know. What does that have to do--
Giles...
Oh god... You've been stalling me. Keeping me away--
Are you okay?
I lost my mom a couple years ago. I came home and found her dead on the couch.
I understand... what you tried to do. But she's dead. He killed her.
And none of it matters. We're preparing to fight a war, and you're looking for revenge on a man who doesn't exist anymore.
Spike's the strongest warrior I have, and we need him if we're going to get through this alive. If you try anything again, he's going to kill you, but more importantly, I'm going to let him.
He's alive, Giles. Spike's alive. Wood failed.
No...

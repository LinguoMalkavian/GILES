Angel, what are you doing -- no. Don't even. I just wanna bask.
You know me. Not big with the damsel- ing.
And then some. You heard?
You have to leave L.A.
Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army.
Okay, how many times do I have to kill you? Ballpark figure.
Speech gettin' old
Well, who does nowadays?
He had to split.
Hey! My kill, my wordplay.
Well, I'm still glad you're here.
I'll have the guys run through this, see if there's anything new. Reliable source?
Well, any port in an apocalypse...
I can already tell you, I don't have anything that goes with this.
Splainy?
And the right person is...
Or me.
So you're gonna be with me in this.
No.
No, you're not gonna be in this fight.
'Cause I can't risk you.
No, I need you gone.
If I lose... if this gets past Sunnydale, then it's days -- or hours -- before the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it.
Well I've lived the files and I... if I can't win this... it's my fight, Angel. It might be my last. But it's mine.
There is no other.
You vampires... did anybody ever tell you that the whole smelling everybody thing is a little gross?
Is that your business?
It's different. He's different. He has a soul now.
What.
What are you, pissed?
He'll make a difference.
Oh my god, are you twelve?
It's not the brush off. Having both of you here would be... confusing.
Everybody! Why are you so -- Are you gonna come by and get all Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?
He's not! But... He is in my heart.
And what was the highlight of our relationship? The time you broke up with me or the time I killed you?
Because... okay, I'm cookie dough, okay?
I'm not done baking yet. I'm not finished becoming... whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I've been looking for someone to make me feel whole, and maybe I just need to be whole. I make it through this, and the next thing, and the next... maybe one day I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then if I want someone to eat m -- or, to enjoy warm delicious cookie- me, then that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.
I don't really think that far ahead. That's kind of the point.
Angel. I do. Sometimes... think that far ahead.
It'd be a long time coming. Years, if ever.
Ow...
You get killed, I'm telling.
I found out it slices, dices and makes julienne Preacher.
I cut him in half. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty neat.
I did find out some history on this puppy. I'll fill you in -- And I got some... (hands over files) ...files, might be helpful, and This. Supposed to be powerful, don't know much more.
Angel.
I sent him back to L.A. To prepare.
Let me guess. You can smell him.
It was a... hello. I was surprised. SPIKE Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or, I guess they do, but --
There was no tongues. Besides, he's gone.
Good, good, I haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap.
One of these days, I'm just gonna put you two in a room and let you rassle it out.
There could maybe be oil of some kind involved...
The who-ket?
How do you figure?
It's volatile. We don't know...
Angel said... this amulet is meant to be worn by a champion.
I want you to be careful.
Faith's still got my room.
I understand.
Oh thank god.
Let's not find out.
You're not him.
An army of vampires. However will I fight a bunch of -- oh right, I've been doing that for years!
Have you ever considered a cool name? Since you're incorporeal and basically powerless you could call yourself "The Taunter." Strikes fear...
You know how many people have said that to me?
Talk on. I'm not afraid of you.
You're right.
No. Yes. I just realized something. Something that really never occurred to me before.
Well? What do you think?
You don't think it's a good idea?
You mean that?
I really do.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't think you could do it.
Dawn should do a research thing.
You could have been in Oxnard...
Willow...
I hate being here. I hate that you have to be here. I hate that there's evil, that it's growing, and I hate that I was chosen to fight it. I wish, a whole lot of the time, that I hadn't been. I know a lot of you wish I hadn't been either.
Potentials are in the basement, follow Faith and Spike.
It's right over the Seal.
Xander, I want you with Dawn.
Dawn...
So. What do you guys wanna do tomorrow?
I'm pretty much thinking about shopping. As usual.
I'm having a wicked shoe craving.
Right, do you go with the full black secret agent look --
It's a fine line.
I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.
Now Willow Now Willow Now....
I'm not worried! As long as Willow can work the spell before they --
Willow...
So here's the part where you make a choice.
I really do.
Keep the line together! Drive them to the edge, we can't let them --
Hold the line...
I want you... to get out of my face .
Spike!
What?
You've done enough, you can still --
Spike...
I love you.
Spike.
Angel, what are you doing -- no. Don't even. I just wanna bask.

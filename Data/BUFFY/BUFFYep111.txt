It's a magic clearance, Dawn. Everything must go.
To you and me, they're just candles. To witches, they're like... bongs.
I'll make sure she gets them back.
Dawn, do me a favor and grab that fertility god statue on the shelf.
I explained this, Dawn. Willow's got... a problem. And these next few weeks are gonna be crazy hard on her as it is...
C'mon, Dawn, you need to eat your breakfast. Xander'll be here any sec!
I meant... "Doing, feeling-wise."
I called you before.
You need to eat something.
Because I let it happen.
Was drowning. My best friend. And I was too wrapped up in my dumb life to notice. Too busy--
What-- What are you doing? And here?
Couldn't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll?
Haven't seen it.
Lame.
You. Making up excuses to--
Stop trying to see me. And stop calling me that.
Um, what the hell's that me-- ohh.
Uh, hey! You really need to get Dawn to school. Let's go fetch her. You can let yourself out. Right?
Dawn! Xander's here. Come--
Oh. Got all your--
And after school, you'll--
You'll come right home.
Can I help you?
For Wednesday.
Right. Dawn, you better get--
Yeah, well. Been one of those mornings, y'know?
Excuse the mess. Doing a little house clean--
(gritted teeth) I... can't right now. I have company.
He's NOT... .. my boyfriend! He's--
Crib! He said 'crib.' You know kids with the... buggin' street slang.
What? No. Oh, the blanket? That's... just a security thing. He's got issues. No, it's just Dawn and me living here.
Oh, okay, Will That's... Willow. She, uh... kinda lives here, too. Actually.
Yeah. We're friends. It's not a gay thing. Well, she's gay. But we don't... gay. I mean, not that...
No. No, I don't think you--
There are good reasons--
I can-- I do--
W-what does that mean?
You can't do that.
Why won't you go?
Get out of here!!
Just make .... . different.
Like to see her try now. Y'know, there may be an upside to no-see me.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you're the ones that did this to me.
And I promise, you're all going down.
Jonathan?
So you three have... what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
(to Willow, re Trio) I give you my arch nemeses.
I know. They're gone.
Pretty neat your finding the van. So what did you... do... exactly? I mean, how'd you manage to locate--
Well... The important thing is you did. It's a... good first step.
Me. I wouldn't. Not too long ago. I probably would've welcomed it. But when he told me...I realized... Not saying I'm doing backflips about my life, but... But, I didn't... I mean, I don't...want to die. That's something, right?
I guess.
Yay.

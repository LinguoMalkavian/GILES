Yeah. I…
That one.
You don't like it?
Dawn-
Dawn. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea, you coming along…
I'm serious. You shouldn't have to deal with this stuff-
No. It's fine. It's done. Okay?
Okay…
Let's just go with them, then. It's simpler.
White. They're nice. (to Giles) What about an announcement? People are going to be expecting a wake after the burial if we don't say something.
Mom didn't like them. She said pot lucks are depressing enough as it is.
Right before she went in for her operation. We had a talk about what she wanted. In case…
You should eat, Dawn.
This isn't about-
I'm phoned out. Can you? I mean, unless it's Dad.
I can't believe he hasn't called yet.
The number he left for us in Spain is no good. And I've left messages all over the place.
I don't have that number. I told you.
Dawn. I tried that. Okay? What do you think? Just a line that says "following the burial, there will be no wake-" or gathering? "there will be no gathering at the request of Joyce?" That's lame.
I guess. I don't know. How about "At the request of the family, there will be no wake following the burial?"
Where do I put it? On top, here? Or on the bottom?
Humm?
If you want. I guess so…
Do we call the post office about this? Maybe we need to fill out a form or something.
Yeah. She should probably get out of here.
I'm okay. Thanks.
…the funeral was… It was brutal… But what I'm really worried about is tomorrow.
That's what I don't know. Up 'til now I've had a road map - things to do, every minute, that had to do with mom…
Which everybody expects me to know how to do because I'm so "strong."
Time's not the issue. I'm good at sticking wood in vampires, but Mom was the strong one in real life. She always knew how to make things better, what to say…
I don't know… I keep thinking about it, Angel. When I found her. If I'd gotten there ten minutes earlier-
No. Probably wouldn't have made a difference. The exact thing they said was probably . I haven't told anyone that-
I didn't even start CPR until they told me to. I fell apart. That's how good I am at being a grown up.
If I just had me to worry about… But Dawn…
It's going to be light soon.
How's forever? Is forever good for you? There's a bad idea. I'm seriously needy right now.
Told you. You'd better go.
Don't be. I'm so grateful you came, Angel. I didn't think I was going to make it through the night.
Good.
Good…
Hello? Hey Tara. Yeah, I just got in-
Dawn -
What have you done?
What have you done ?!
You have no idea what you're messing with! Who knows what you actually raised - what's going to come through that door-
No. Tara told me these spells go bad all the time. People come back wrong -
Who told you? Who helped you?!
You have to stop it, reverse it-
Dawn . You know this is wrong. You know you can't let this happen. Not to Mom.
What? Of course you do. You have me-
That's - that's not true-
God - of course I care. Of course I do. How can you think that?
I've been working - I've been busy, because I have to… be…
I'm not . I have to do these things, 'cause… 'cause when I stop, then she's really… gone. And I'm trying, really trying to take care of things… But I don't even know what I'm doing… Mom, she always knew-
Well, who's going to be if I'm not? Huh, Dawn? Have you thought about that? Who's going to make things better? Who's going to take care of us?
I didn't mean to push you away… I didn't… I just didn't want you to see me… I mean… Oh, God… What are we going to do, Dawny? I'm so scared-
Mommy?
Mom!
Dawn-

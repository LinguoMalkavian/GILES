What's that Rona?
Okay Spike.
No. Not yet. But it's there -- the potential . You have strength, speed, instinct. Learn to trust yourself. (to Rona) Rona, what did your instincts tell you to do just now?
No they didn't.
Vi?
Don't fight on his terms. If your gut's telling you to run, run. Regain the higher ground. Make the fight your own.
Come at me. Full speed.
Instinct. Understand his, but trust yours. (to the girls) You're chosen for a reason.
Let me see.
Spike --
All right. Kennedy, Molly -- you're up. Let's go.
You're all going to die.
Best we can tell? He, or, more precisely, it was putting a lot of stock in that uber-vamp thing, the Chaka Khan...
...so when I kicked its ass, we figure the whole Firsty circus decided to back off. Good news is that means we probably don't have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while.
Xand, I know... No, I'm sorry, but... well, lock the door if you're gonna shower at my place. Of course they're curious.
Well, I guess, sure, in a charming, endearing, lovable... yes.
Just 'cause people think you're weird --
Amanda. Why do you think you're weird?
Oh.
Ah... ha
Sometimes that's true.
Well. Depends. Sometimes it's how people relate. Being mean to each other. Or mortal enemies, even. But, then with the... And, believe me, it leads to no good. Absolutely. No. Good. And much confusion. And then it's over. Really, definitely over. And that's confusing, too. The over part. Which it is. Over.
I was only gone a couple hours.
Look, everyone, it's Willow, perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.
And she's sure?
God.
I was gonna take the girls out for a little show and tell tonight, maybe now I shouldn't.
This town is lousy with Bringers, I don't want to take the risk that they find her first.
You think you can handle it?
Okay. Okay, I'll take them...
Andrew. You're not coming.
You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.
He's not evil, but when he gets close to it he picks up its flavor like a mushroom or something.
You're not coming.
Spike didn't have free will. You did.
Ready.
That's okay. Usually, when you come to a place like this, it's 'cause you want to be seen You want to scare someone, or make contact--
Not usually that.
Sure, I drink. I mean, no, that would be wrong.
Nope, go 'head. Down all the yak urine shots and pig's blood spritzers you want.
Look, if I come here, it usually means I've gotta wring some information out of something large, scary, drunk and with a roomful of friends who don't care for the Slayer. Remember that. There's not a being in here who wouldn't gladly rip out your throat.
Clem! Hey! You look great! Really toned!
Hey, let me talk to you for a second.
Clem, these are the girls. The Potentials.
Sometimes the animal hunts alone. Sometimes they run in packs. Who knows where we are?
Now can you tell?
Thank you, Spike.
He's got a point. The vampire can live anywhere, any way it wants. Tastes, fashions, living conditions - they can vary. But the animal inside? Always the same.
Comfy.
I mean, I'm guessing. I really wouldn't know. Moving on:
Know something, Spike?
No. It's not a body.
No one's safe. Not here. Not ever. See this guy?
That was a minute ago. Now?
He's the enemy.
Reacting's better.
The question is never "what do you think?" The question is always, "what do you know?" You gotta know. Because if you don't, you make one mistake...
You're dead. So what do you know? Right now, the only thing you know for sure is, you've got me.
Fight now. Talk later.
Hey.
Great. Sounds good. Let's head downstairs guys. Get our newest arrival up to speed.

You don't like the color.
No, I believe that's your trick. I told you I'm going out for the cheerleading squad.
And you'll be stopping me how?
I'll still have time to fight the forces of evil, okay? But I want to have a life. I want to do something normal. Something safe.
He totally lost his water. We haven't even seen a vampire in a week. I'd say he should get a girlfriend if he wasn't so old.
What is this?
This is so sweet! "Yours always..."
They have cheerleading coaches?
That kind of quality time with my mom would probably lead to some quality matricide.
What the ... ?
It's okay, you're gonna be okay...
I've been slaying Vampires for more than a year now. I've seen some pretty cringeworthy stuff, but nobody's hands ever got toasted.
So this is not a vampire problem.
But it is funky , right? Not of the norm?
Any common denominator in cases of spontaneous combustion?
So I should get the skinny on Amber. See if she's had any colorful episodes before.
Guys, you don't have to get involved.
I don't want you putting yourselves in danger.
Okay, well, I'm psyched for the help. And what if we find out Amber didn't cause this herself?
I hope so...
Hey, Mom.
A reverent joy. What's all this?
Oh. Cool.
We had tryouts today.
Well, I didn't get to try out yet. There was an accident. Pretty fierce competition, though.
Mom?
What was I trying out for?
That's okay. Your platitudes are good for all occasions.
It was cheerleading tryouts.
I'm not in trouble, mom.
What is it?
You know, this girl Amy trains with her mom like three hours a day. Sounds like her mom's really into it.
Jeepers.
Don't worry, you'll do great.
No... Catherine Madison. Get down with your bad self.
That's kinda romantic.
Okay, that part's less romantic. My folks split up, too.
She sounds great, Amy, but that doesn't mean you have to, you know, lock step as far as the cheerleading thing --
She's wiggin' about her mother... ...the big cheer queen back when.
Nazi-like?
So Mommie Dearest is really... Mommie Dearest.
Any word on Amber?
We'll just have to see what happens next. Maybe nothing will.
Excuse me.
At least it's over. And you know what I think we should do about it? Brownie pig-out, my house, now.
Mom, I accepted that you've had sex. I'm not ready to know you've had Farrah hair.
That's cool. I gotta book --
Not really my tip, mom.
Have you seen the kids who do yearbook, mom? Nerds pick on them.
This just in: I'm not you. I'm into my own thing.
Is that even Cordelia's locker?
Hang on, Xander, I have to... we can pick this up later, you don't mind, do you?
Cordelia, it's okay, you're gonna be -- Oh, god...
They're both cheerleaders.
Or likes it too much.
Amy.
She's desperate to get on that team... I get the feeling she'd do anything to make her mom's dream come true.
Your point being?
I think you're underestimating the amount of pressure a parent can lay on you. If you're not a picture perfect carbon copy they tend to wig.
All right, you're a high school girl, you're desperate to make the team and please your mom, you turn to witchcraft. What's the first thing you do?
"The Pagan Rites", checked out by Alexander --
You think?
Oh yeah.
Help. Which is the hydrochloric acid and which is the ammonium hydroxide?
Read the bottles -- what a concept.
Spill it on her, try and make it look natural.
The test was positive. She's our Sabrina. I just don't think she realizes what she's doing.
Maybe we should talk to her mother . I wonder if she knows what she's created.
Oops.
MACHO MACHO MAN... Hey, juice.
Quality juice. Not from concentrate.
I am. I'm on the squad. Which is great because I feel like cheering. And leading others to cheer. Hey, juice!
That's totally yester. Besides, it's not like you were wrong. I did get kicked out. I'm wacky that way.
Mom, you don't get it. Believe me, you don't want it. There's just things about being a vampire slayer that the older generation has a problem with.
Long story. I mean I'm kidding.
I can't be in a good mood? That's a new house rule? Fine, I don't mind, cuz I'm a MACHO MACHO MAN...
Hey Willow, Xander! My buds are here. I love my buds.
Did I do that?
No no no, you don't want her, she's a wi--
She's a witchy!!
I just got kicked off the team, didn't I?
I know you don't. That's cause you're my friend. You're my Xander-shaped friend. ...do you have any idea why I love you so, Xander?
I'll tell you. You're not like other guys at all...
You are completely and totally one of the girls. I'm that comfy with you.
Any other guy gave me a bracelet, they'd want to date me, it'd be a thing, but you -- you --
Oh. I don't feel so good.
Something is really... not good...
'Cause she knows I know she's a witch.
Kill.
Truth please.
No. It's not Amy's fault. She became a witch to survive her mother.
Giles, where would she be casting these spells?
At home. Help me get up. We'll go to her house, find her book --
No. Stay here, keep an eye on Amy.
Amy?
Are you Amy?
She switched, didn't she? She switched your bodies. She wanted to relive her glory days. Catherine the Great.
Amy, it's gonna be okay.
Did we find?
Amy?
Hey, guess what?
I feel better.
Oh, grow up.
Are you guys okay?
You save my life. You were a god.
Giles, stop being so proper. You're in America. Brag.
Xander, what are you doing?
What?
I'm inscrutable, huh?
Do you ever wish you could be? Sixteen again?
I love you, mom.
You're loving it.
No, that's okay. Cheerleading is just a little too hairy these days.
And there's been no sign of her?
Twisted.
Well, that look is in for spring.
You don't like the color.
No, I believe that's your trick. I told you I'm going out for the cheerleading squad.
And you'll be stopping me how?

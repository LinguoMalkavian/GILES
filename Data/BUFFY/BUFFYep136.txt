Spike!
Well, when we were in the Initiative...
To repair the chip or just remove it...
Yeah.
You've just heard horror stories, that's all. Wear hoops and they'll catch on something, rip your lobes off, lobes flying everywhere...
You mean Spike not having a chip. Free-range Spike.
I guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.
And the principal.
Oh, nothing much, just, he was in the school basement with a shovel, acting kind of evasive. And he's got a "too charming to be real" thing going on. I'm gonna look into it.
Nothing's really changed, Giles. Spike had a chip before, remember? When The First made him kill and sire those people?
It doesn't matter. The girls aren't in danger from him. He wouldn't let that happen. I trust him.
He has a soul now, Giles. That's what's going to keep him from hurting anyone. I'm going to trust that before I trust some chip we already know can go bad on him.
He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never going to get there if we never give him a chance.
Giles, if you're saying there are sparks between him and me, you're wrong. Spike and I haven't-- things are different since he came back. Just look in his eyes and you'll see he's changed. There's... there's a person in there now.
You think I'm losing sight of the big picture. But I'm not. When Spike had that chip in him it was like, like having him in a muzzle or something. It feels wrong. We can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.
My judgment is clear.
Now, if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be?
HEY! Principal Wood! It's you!
YES! File folders! And mechanical pencils. I wanted to write on a file folder with a mechanical pencil.
Oh... so this isn't the... the supply cabinet. Right. Well, thanks!
Yes?
Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.
Watching a reality show about a millionaire.
I'd... sure, I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
Yeah. Isn't that weird? He's a principal. A young hot principal with earrings, but a principal. Why do you suppose he asked me out?
I don't know. When he looks at me, he's like intense, you know? There's eye contact with all four of our eyes. He could be interested, right?
Or it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing a good job.
Or maybe he knows I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out to kill me.
It's not even that his behavior's that suspicious. But there he is, right over the Hellmouth all day every day. It's gotta be like being showered with evil, only from underneath.
A bidet, then. A bidet of evil.
Good god, how many socks are in there?
Well we'll see about that when the fighting starts. I didn't mean that.
Oh, Will. I don't know. He's very good-looking. And funny and solid and... normal, so not the wicked energy, which is nice, because I don't want to be attracted only to the wicked energy... unless he is wicked, in which case, is that why I like him?
Anyway, yeah. I like him. And it might be good for me.
Move on? Does everyone in this house think I'm in love with Spike?
Oh--
Sorry. It's Principal Wood and I think he's aligned with The First.
Yay, someone who doesn't remember the industrial revolution.
Be quiet, Willow, or we're gonna make you talk about your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think we don't notice.
What did she say?
Hey, Will, I wonder if you can do a computer check on Principal Wood for me. See what you can find?
Well, it is unclear. That's why I chose a top that says "I'm comfortable in a stodgy office or a swingin' casual setting or killing you because you're a demon."
Oh, okay.
But it's not working. ANYA Are you nuts? Of course it's working! Observe my bitter ranting! Hear the shrill edge of hysteria in my voice!
Oh. Okay. Look, I've gotta pick out another top...
Oh. Thanks. Traditionally, one wears something over this.
That's not clear, I've got this whole theory about a promotion. Or he's evil.
You don't have to...
Good. I'm glad. Thank you.
Right. And, hey... you should do this too. Go out sometime I mean. There was the girl you took to Xander and Anya's not-a-wedding.
Sure I can see that. I... gotta go. I don't wanna be late.
This isn't right.
Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.
You set me up! You son of a what?
Uh...
Ooh, nice place and how the hell did you do that?
Just kinda... freelance?
And you know who I am?
Right. So... I'm guessing you work in an office about fifteen feet over a Hellmouth because you love educational administration.
So I wasn't hired for my counseling skills?
Why didn't you tell me about you earlier?
You weren't sure you could trust me.
And now you are?
You knew I was the Slayer before you got here.
How? How do you know about Slayers?
You're-- My god. I didn't know any Slayers had children.
Something got her? A demon or a...
Not most of 'em, no. Are you... do you have Slayer powers? I mean, I just... I'm floored by this... I don't even know what to ask.
In Beverly Hills.
So you decided to tell me.
In a darkened little romantic French restaurant.
Oh my God!
Oh my God, this is the best thing I ever had in my mouth.
Schpike!
You sure he's at the high school?
Can't this thing go any faster?
How much further is it?
Principal Wood is the son of a Slayer, isn't that interesting?
Don't see much of that.
Um, Spike works with me. In the struggle against evil, you know.
...If she's got him here, it'll be on the Hellmouth, right under us. You got weapons? Not stakes, and not arrows, it's gonna be tight down there. We need blades.
Thanks.
Get Xander!
Hi, Xand. I'm here.
Principal Wood's a demon-fightin' son of a Slayer.
What if you just start attracting male demons?
Willow did. The First is back in the mix.
No. You have to stay.
That's not why I need you here.
Because I'm not ready for you not to be here.
He's a guy on our side. I can't turn away from that. Something tells me I'm gonna need lots of help.
Well, when we were in the Initiative...
To repair the chip or just remove it...
Yeah.

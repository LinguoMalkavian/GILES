Invitation.
The basement at the school is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.
No. No, a gallon of no. It's just - things are different. He has a soul now.
I don't know, exactly. But he's been through a lot and nobody's attacking-
No. It's okay. I'm just-
It will. It's already working. You've been out of the basement for half an hour and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
Okay. So there was that one episode in the car-
It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.
What's what?
You ask a good question.
I just... The truth is - I don't know what I feel. I think I can't stand him, but then sometimes...
No. I feel for him.
Dawn...
He didn't. I mean, he tried-
I really should've killed her. Dawn, it was complicated. But I'd broken it off with him. I didn't want to anymore.
It's okay. I get the question. I've asked it myself a few times. For the record? Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away.
I wish I had better answers. Or ones with big words you couldn't really follow.
It truly is.
Bye, rant-girl.
Come on, Dawnie, come out. Dawn. Honey. It's not that bad-
From what you said, I'm pretty sure he already noticed you. What with the falling and the-
Dawn...
I don't think tonight is going to be good for videos, Xand.
Dawn - what's that?
You shredded my outfit.
Not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit-
Dawnie. I'm sorry you feel so bad. But this won't feel so terrible in the morning. I mean, you don't even know this R.J. Not really.
Really? Cause yesterday he wasn't even on your radar-
Again, since yesterday? That's awfully fast.
Of course not, no. If you say it's love...
I believe it seems real. To you.
What? I'm not-
Could you have accidentally bumped into him or something?
Be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.
Least he's showering. That's a delightful and refreshing change...
I think that's the guy.
The guy who, according to Dawn, is, quote, the hottest, deepest, smartest, funniest and having-of-the- thickest-boy-eyelashes boy in school. Unquote.
What is that blouse made of, paint?
No, I'm glad Dawnie isn't here to see her precious boyfriend getting all... thrusty with some slut-bag hussy --
So, you have plans for later, or you just gonna go down to the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?
Where do I start with the bad? First - you said you were going to the library. Second - you don't go on a date without informing me first. And third - Anna Nicole Smith thinks you look tacky.
I bet be does. You know, maybe I should have a word with him-
I don't like this, Dawn. This guy has you acting crazy.
Not this way, no.
I don't think so-
No, I'm not, and I'm glad she isn't here to see you like this.
What?
That's not true-
You're not going back out on that dance floor.
First with the lap dance, now with the cat fight. Hey - wanna get drunk and barf next?
Well. At least someone agrees you shouldn't be dating this guy.
Whoa, hang on there, Slappy. Not done with you yet.
I'm actually a bit more formidable than Mr. Wood, you might come to look fondly on his back-riding.
Sit.
Not the homework, Mr. Wizard. The girls. What you're doing to them. In specific, my sister.
aaAAAAHHHH! No more with the talky!
Yeah. I see how you get along. Oooh, look at me, I'm a big quarterback...
No. I know. But you're a leader. A captain. People look up to you and you have to keep that in mind whenever... (trails off, thinking) I bet you have to run a lot.
I get that. I really do. I'm there. Or, I was there, when I was in high school. Which I was. Just a couple years ago, really. I just realized, I'm basically the same age as you, not really older. At all, actually. Just like you. But with the sexual experience and stuff. R.J. I think I hear what you're saying...
Right. I'm glad we had this talk. You should probably... get to class.
I just want to tell you I talked to R.J.
He happened to be in the office. We said a few words. And he's okay. I think he likes you.
He thinks you're funny and pretty and interesting. Didn't have a thing to say against you.
Tiniest thing. He... He might have said you... came on a little strong.
Not at all! Just lay back a little, let him come to you.
But see, we have inside info. We know he doesn't like being swept. He wants to be the sweeper. You're gonna come out the winner here, Dawn, with me looking out for you.
Hi, sorry to interrupt. We need to see R.J. Brooks down in the guidance office.
It'll just take a moment. I promise I'll have him right back to you.
Yes, there is. There's one of you, and there's one of me. You were the one in math class, tell me what that adds up to.
What's it really like to lead a team? It's gotta be like... being a gladiator, right? Leading warriors into battle.
Oh, I get that! I was, kinda, juggling some stuff in high school too, which was very recent. And it's like everyone expects you to have all this free time for studying! Principal Snyder was always on me.
Oh Snyder was twice the terror that Wood was. Also, half. Short. He was a little short.
Yeah, that would be cool.
Not really. But... I mean, does it bother you?
Xander, hi, this, um, this is R.J. --
Dawn, please stop crying. Please.
You're right. He's right. You're under a spell. Poor little Dawnie.
He's not a boy!
Hear that? This isn't real. You're just crazy.
I betrayed you? You're the one who's constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover!
I tried to get you to back away. If you'd listened to me you wouldn't've had to see what you saw!
I was trying to be kind to you, like I always do. Did you want me to tell you that he's in love with me? That your crush is hopeless?
Why? Because he's younger than me? I'm extremely peppy and youthful!
Dawn! Wait!
She's locked her door. That spell has her good and loopy.
Ooh. Lemme see! Is there a picture?
Now look for a picture.
Willow, you're a gay woman! And he isn't!
Wait. Everyone wait. Calm down. I know what this is.
Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out and we don't need you interfering.
Dawnie, sweetie, go to your room, okay? This isn't about you.
No! Yes! Kill for him! I'm a Slayer. Slay means kill. Oh! I can kill the principal!
Sorry, Dawnie. You're never gonna get him.
What're you guys doing?
I've got a principal to kill. What's going on? Who are we looking for?
You realize Anya is probably seducing R.J. even as we speak.
I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.
Dawn? Dawn!
What were you -- what is this?
This is a plan? You're gonna steal R.J. by being tri-sected?
Oh, Dawn.
Dawnie... You have so much to offer any guy. I'm just older than you. Marginally. And so, yeah, of course he wants me. But he's not important. You are. No guy is worth your life. Not ever.
No. He's not worth it. Honey, I'd give him to you in a second if I could, that's how much you're scaring me.
Nah. Well, yeah. My god, that boy is hot! Sorry. I think I may be under a spell here.
Be honest, Xander. You didn't think about, you know, just slipping that jacket on a little bit?
So how did R.J. take the abrupt removal of his mojo?
And I can't believe I almost-
Hear that? Not your fault.
Get ready to feel even stupider when it's not.

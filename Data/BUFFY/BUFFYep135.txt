I think we've managed without you for a bit longer than that.
Okay, just leave.
I know - but you should go. The girls need this trip to understand the source of their power. And to know how to use it right.
That's not exactly the way I put it-
Betcha now you wish you'd renewed that California driver's license.
Yes. You too.
Spike...?
Giles is off. On the retreat. Said to say goodbye.
From Giles?
I have no idea what you mean.
I enjoy my responsibilities as mentor and, and role model and life guide and oh my god, I can't believe I have my bathroom back for two whole days!
And have you seen the kitchen since they got here?
I noticed.
Okay. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls.
So we find a way to make sure the trigger is deactivated. We've got a couple of days. Lack of pitter- patter and all. Maybe-
What?
Ow?
Spike? Spike ?
What's happening, what are you --
In the "goes" part of comes and goes.
You'd think... That for the other patient?
Hmmm.
Will?
It's just...
No. No, no, he was fine. That's what's weird. He said it felt like chip pain, but he wasn't... he didn't do anything.
Yeah. Imagine that. An ex of mine with a mysterious, pain-inducing problem. Remember when things used to be nice and boring?
Have fun delivering the tea.
So, I had to dig a little bit for a clean towel, seems we've completely lost control of --
There must be a reason why the chip is going all wonky now, maybe it's related to the trigger, or it's, like, interference from the new soul thing, or --
Okay. Okay, well, we'll fix it. We'll get the gang on it, we'll hit serious research mode --
You're right, it's not a book thing. It's a phone thing.
Doubt it. Hang tight.
Yes. Agent Finn. Riley. Tell him we're having a problem with Spike's chip. No, his chip. Spike.
Yeah, Finn's his last -- Well, did he used to work there, did he get transferred recently, or... Oh. Okay.
Ow!
What happened?
What makes you think that?
Guys.
Say you're right. You did this to yourself. Why would your subconscious turn you into Warren?
Got it. So we'll deal. We'll help.
On your own? Why?
Kinda too late, Will.
I'm right here.
Kinda figured.
Maybe they'll call back. Send help.
Yup. Here are we.
Eh. Nothing good on TV tonight.
I'm... maybe we should look around for files and stuff, too. We can learn about the chip, its shelf life.
Ready?
Oh god.
Guess not.
Casualties in Adam's final battle here.
I'm thinking brief stay.
Yup.
Looks like.
No. Sounded like it was over there...
Spike!
Spike! Spike!
Ha! Government conspiracy, I knew it!
Okay. How long until --
Right. Of course What do we do next?
My... what was my call?

It's like these people have never seen an apocalypse before. And you're just out for a quick spin, right? Maybe out to the 7-11... in Nebraska...
Right.
Yeah. I probably should.
...and that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandage. Bruising around the... area. The, uh, musculature and bone structure took a heavy hit.
Also, the meds may cause some stomach discomfort, so we're gonna have to be, you know, careful. About your diet.
And we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Once your labs are back. Doctor Kallet says they should be a couple hours.
Okay, I think you're all caught up. (re: folder) Thanks for this, Willow. Great work.
Yeah, you know, I should really get back. (re: folder again) I wanna get 'em working on this stuff. I think we're getting really close to something.
He's doing really well, he's ready to come home, I think.
Info Willow and Giles were able to get from the police database.
Exactly. We start with California, if nothing turns up, we expand the search to other areas, but a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game, he's been playing for a while. We thought we'd try to find out where.
Right. And if that doesn't work, we'll try something else. Whatever it takes. You okay to help?
Good.
Okay.
Okay. So we're looking for anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring...
It's okay. You know, I gotta get to the school anyway, pick up the rest of my stuff.
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, doesn't... isn't Anya doing a thing for you guys today?
Okay, I'll be back soon. See if you can get everyone started on this stuff in the meantime.
Get out of here.
You get near Xander again, I will end you.
Just ornery, I guess.
Guys? How's it --
Caleb came looking for seconds.
Still able to make me see little cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. The short lack of consciousness was nice, though. I feel rested.
Really? That's... that's great. That could help us a lot, good job --
Oh.
And, again, I ask the question...
Well, those are the ones that've been scaring me.
You sent away the guy who's been watching my back. Again. I think --
Yeah. Funny how I don't really feel that lately.
Where's everyone else?
Faith, the girls... where'd everyone go?
What are you doing?
Girls. Go home. I wanna talk to Faith for a minute.
Dawn, you too. Go on.
Taking a break is one thing, I get blowing off steam, but they were fighting. And those girls are drunk. What were you thinking?
What if someone'd gotten hurt?
Faith. I need to know those girls are gonna be safe when I'm not there.
It's one thing to learn from your mistakes. But you don't throw children into --
That's really not the point.
What?
I wanted you to be here for this, I think you're gonna be interested in what I found out.
It's about the wine cellar.
Listen, I know what you're thinking, scary place where good guys go boom, I get it. I do. But I had a little visit today at the school from Caleb.
I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. I figured it out. He kept making all this noise about the school.
No, that's just it. We've spent so much time being worried about the Hellmouth and the Seal... why isn't Caleb guarding them?
I'm not saying it'll be easy --
I'm not just guessing about this.
There is something there.
You're waiting for some kind of mystical sign to show up and tell us it's the right time, that sort of thing almost never happens, least, not for us. We need to strike now.
I don't know that. We don't know that. What if we let it go and we lose our chance? I'm not prepared to live with that.
I don't understand. Seven years I've kept us safe by doing this, exactly this, making the hard decisions. Suddenly you're all acting like you don't trust me.
Is this why you sent Spike away? To ambush me?
What?
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm a who? I'm not --
I don't need rest! Willow, I'm fine. I'm... I'm fine.
The old way. You mean by leading.
Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. It would be more fair, I agree. But democracies don't win battles. It's a hard truth, but there has to be a single voice. You need me to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and not take your feelings into account.
No, I --
Look --
I --
I've gotten you this far.
Xander...
Xander. I've paid the price, too, sometimes.
I still think attacking Caleb's power base could end this --
Is that really something you want to get into? 'Cause we can talk about Spike. Or Ben.
Stop it.
Giles.
Goddamn you, stop!!
I am still responsible for this group. I am still in charge here.
Because I'm the Slayer.
Listen. You don't wanna do this. (to Willow and Xander) Guys, tell them. This is a mistake.
Guys. We have a chance to end this. All of us. I can't just stay here and watch Faith lead you off into some disaster.
It's like these people have never seen an apocalypse before. And you're just out for a quick spin, right? Maybe out to the 7-11... in Nebraska...

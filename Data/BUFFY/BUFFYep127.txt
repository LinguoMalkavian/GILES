So have you talked to her?
I just don't want you to get your hopes up, that's all.
Strong successful males say "giddy?"
I'm not sure I get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe worth worrying about.
I hope you're right.
What sort of things?
Spike --
It's different, You're different.
Spike, it's me. It's you and it it's me. And we'll get through this.
We'll get through this.
You have a soul? Fine. Show me,
Get up and get out of this basement.
You have everywhere else to go. Because there's no place worse than where you are right now.
Hello? Willow! Is everythi -- Wait. Okay. Wait. Spider Demon? Are you all right? Like how -- Uh-huh...
No no no no no -- don't even worry about it. I'll get Xander. No. You just --
Thanks for the sidekicking. I didn't want to trouble Willow. Figure she's got enough to do, first day back and all.
Some sort of spider demony thing. She got off the phone pretty quick. Had to sign up for classes or something.
I think she's been a little more nervous than she lets --
She didn't say. But I can't imagine she'd send us off like this if it was -- Ripped out his heart. This is our guy.
I don't know. It's on the trees.
Willow said it was a spider -- maybe it's his webbing.
Xander...
I can't tell. There seems to be something moving...
Xander!
Uh-huh...
I'm more concerned where that thing came from. If there are more of these spider demons running around, we need to know about it. We should hit the research, find out if --
How many?
Xander...
Xander, it's okay. She didn't tell us for a reason.
She's not the Anya you knew, Xander. She's a demon.
Don't act like this is easy for me. You know it's not.
I've considered them.
The thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. It's occurred to you too.
It's okay. I know this is hard for you to hear, but it's what I have to do.
I don't want to --
It's different.
I know. And that's why you can't see this for what it is. Willow was different. She's human. Anya's a demon.
It's never simple, Xander.
Spike was harmless. He was HELPING.
And Anya did! She chose to become a demon. TWICE!
I don't care what she's going through.
I KILLED ANGEL. Do you even remember that? I would have given up everything to be with... I loved him more than anything I will ever love in this life and I put a sword through his heart because I had to .
You remember cheering me on? Both of you? You remember giving me Willow's message: "Kick his ass?"
It's always different. It's always complicated and at some point someone has to draw a line and that is always going to be me. You get down on me for cutting myself off, but in the end the Slayer's always cut off. There's no mystical guidebook, no all- knowing council -- human rules don't apply and Father doesn't know best. There's only me. I am the Law.
Then please find it.
Get out of my way, Xander.
Anya, I'm sorry.
I'm just getting started.
Go. I'll go check on the... boys.

Okay, but don't blame me if we have this same conversation over and...
... over and over and --
What are you doing lurking down here?
I don't know. Could it have something to do with the lurking ?
One time deal to help out. And I mean straight time -- no loop de loop mummy hand repeato vision. Where's the Mandrake root?
Thanks.
What?
Oh, uh... I should stay. These Mandrake roots aren't gonna get up the stairs themselves.
Maybe tomorrow night, okay?
So much easier to talk to when he just wanted to kill me.
What happened to Xander?
Actually, Spike had this really good idea about patrolling --
But what about costumes taking over your personality or wee little Irish fear demony thingies?
So maybe I should patrol to avoid trouble and - I'm bagging.
Tomorrow?
You know if you had a real peg leg, you wouldn't just have a lame costume. You'd actually be lame, which is a whole other--
Xander! She's fifteen! And my sister, so don't even -- Oh.
Did you know about this?
Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we're doing?
Giles, this is -- We have to do something...
Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy. You kind of caught us with our parties down.
You're getting married. You .
Seems like just yesterday you couldn't pay a girl to date you.
I'm out of commission for three months and you... How many other things have changed since I've been away?
What?!
Over my dead body. The kind that doesn't come back.
Tomorrow?
Wait -- that's tonight?
Yeah, okay, I know, but now with Xander's party --
I don't know. Giles. . .?
The important thing is you're happy. Everything else is thick gravy goodness.
You okay?
But it's a good thing, right? This is love and celebration and moving forward. Anya's right. This is the way life's supposed to work out.
Definite wallow action.
My breaches are wearing a little thin. Think maybe I'll swing by Spike's, take him up on that patrol. Gotta be something out there trolling for a smackdown.
Get your gear together, we need to --
Good thing you're uncivilized. We've got trouble.
Giles? No, is he looking for me?
What happened? Is she all right?
Wait, Dawn's running around out there somewhere?
We have to find her.
Dawn! Are you --
How could you not know?
So you were parked in the woods with a boy you just met?
Shut up. I can't believe you.
That was different.
Didn't any of you come here just to make out?
Been there, done that.
Giles!
Sorry about the party.
Good fight.
How's the face?
She's taking it pretty hard.
You're right. I'm glad you're here to sort it out. Don't be too hard on her, okay?
What are you doing lurking down here?

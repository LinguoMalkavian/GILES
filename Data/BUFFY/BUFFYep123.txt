Who's got it... who knows how to use it...
The stake is not the power.
He seems to have some focus there...
Who's got the power?
Never forget that. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are, how well armed you are, you're a little girl.
You're a little woman.
He's a vampire . Okay? A demon. Preternaturally strong, skilled, with power that no human can ever --
You're stuck.
Zip it.
Listen up. I'm the Slayer, you don't wanna get into it with me. You want blood, okay? So you can have hers. She's not the Slayer. She's the one to go after. Not me.
Okay then.
It's real. That's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real.
Really.
You wanted to be trained...
Geez, one violent near-death experience and you're suddenly all testy.
You did pretty well.
Yeah.
My first time out I missed the heart too.
Just the once.
The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.
Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few more days 'til it starts -- and then we'll never know what's coming next.
Dawn! Xander's here!
You're gonna be late!
You gotta eat! I made cereal!
You're unconscionably spiffy.
You put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. You want anything?
My sister's about to go to the same school that tried to kill me for three years. I can't afford private school, I can't change districts, and I can't begin to prepare her for what could come out of there, so peachy with a side of keen, that would be me.
You got the rest of it?
Go talk with your mouth full.
Nothing's creepy? Strange? From Beyond?
It was under the library.
... the principal's office.
Or in a boatload of danger.
I guess we'll see. Time to head out Got your books? Lunch? Stakes?
Saving it.
Back to school gift.
Yes it is.
I'm gonna take her to class. Have a look around.
Thanks.
Stay away from hyena people, lizardy- type athletes... if you see anyone invisible --
You could still drop out. Only nerds finish school.
This place is evil.
Oh. Hi.
Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.
So you're the principal. I expected you to be more... aged.
No! Oh. No. Sister.
You didn't really think... Is it my hair? Do I have mom hair?
Yeah. How did you --
Well that was suspicious.
Dawn --
It's not mom hair...
Dawn!
We gotta go. It's not safe.
We, I mean I saw...
No, I... just I thought you were in danger of, um... smoking, and let's not, kids, 'cause it's not cool to... I'll be around.
It's great, if you're a zombie-ghost- thing.
Seems like old times.
I'm not sure. They were in the mirror, they disappeared, but they touched me. I think. Let's just start with "dead" and "pissed".
Talked about protecting people. Told me to leave.
I think I may have destroyed Dawn's social life in all of thirty seconds, but apart from that, no.
I don't know. You could blow up the school again...
It's not a coincidence, you know. The school being rebuilt. It means something... more.
Sorry.
Well, I was looking...
It's a new campus. I just want to get to know it. Make sure it's all right. For my sister.
Isn't that interesting.
Hey! That's loud.
'Scuse me. Uh huh? (to Wood) Sorry. It's my dog. My dog walker. Three dead?
...Yeah...
I'll be right there.
Yeah?
Dawn!
Where's my sister?
If I'm the one that let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here... What are you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?
Again, wrong sister. I'm the one that dates dead guys. And no offense, but they were hotties. I mean, I'm sure you had a great personality...
What do you want?
I'd love to. Really. But --
Actually, I think all you want is to get between me and that door.
Spike...?
What? What duck? There's a duck?
They'll probably show up in a sec --
Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down with some kids --
Spike... what happened...
Dawn?
I'm... where are you?
Yeah, they came after me.
So far, to piss me off.
Oh, I'm damage bound. I just can't figure them -- ghosts can't touch you and zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what we're --
Hold on...
Spike, you gonna help me out?
I'll get back to you.
We just gotta hold 'em at bay --
You really wanna keep this up?
Yeah. Talisman must've been Destroyed.
There's always a talisman.
I don't know... it seems smaller.
You guys are gonna be okay. This school is intense, but you can do all right if you're careful. And you might wanna think about sticking together.
What is? You is?
You really did do your homework.
Well, we shared an... encounter. Sometimes you just gotta break the ice.
Hamnoo?
Is this that nightmare where I didn't take finals? Should I be in my jammies?
You may need a little extra there.
You want me to be a counselor?
I'm in.
I heard. I've been temping, my schedule could be a little funtastic, but I'll work it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.
Just let me know.
It's about power.
The stake is not the power.
He seems to have some focus there...

Controlling the gag reflex?
Bucket.
Tall guy, bleached mullet, works day shifts?
I'm re-applying.
You go to night school?
What sane person would?
Oh, may I?
Yes, you will. And the night after that. And the night after that. And the night after that ...
"Get the double treat/that's so double sweet/oh it's hard to beat/when the meat meets the ..." Aah! I cannot get that stupid jingle out of my head!
Wait.
I've been working!
D-Doublemeat Palace.
You're dead. You smell like it. How do you get to say I'm the one who's ... (genuinely hurt) ... stinky?
Oh, for Pete's sake. Spike?
No, Spike.
I don't need to. We both know what you're thinking.
No! Not here. I can't.
Dawn
Reason number one on a very long list.
C'mon, I mean it ...
Oh. Hey. Dawn. Hi.
The usual. Brought you dinner.
I know, it's not the most original these days, but ... I made 'em myself! I made hundreds of them, actually, and this -- is the best one.
Oh. Yeah. But you know, you know, give it a minute, 'cause these babies really bounce back. Literally.
No, I get it. Okay Um, tomorrow night? I could bring home the Fisherman Nuggets with cheese.
Why does everyone keep asking me that?
He's not getting any gentler.
They. Them. Vampires, in the general population sense. Now I gotta wash this ...
Um ... you guys go.
Thanks. But I'm sure I've seen enough action for one night. Home by eleven?
Have fun.
Oh, garbage!
Wait! Wait up! Guys ...
Thanks "Sorry to inform ..."
Nothing.
Maybe next time. Where are you going?
Oh. That's good. Uh, don't you want some breakfast first?
Bye.
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Welcome to the Doublemeat Palace, how may I... help ...
Hurn?
Riley.
It's you.
You're here.
And -- were you always this tall?
Not a word you've said so far.
Just counter, not grill ...
My hat has a cow.
Todd? He's got just enough authority to make my life miserable.
From the Doublemeat Palace? Tougher than you'd think. So you're tracking a demon.
What is it?
I'm sorry, I just... you still carry around all the James Bond stuff. It's so cute, I forgot.
Got it. Like really mean Tribbles. I've been dealing with some geeks lately, it's a whole thing.
Yes please.
Uh... I'm with him.
I'll feel better when we catch it.
Nice wheels.
Know where we're going?
How's the arm?
Complicated question.
I know.
Did you die?
I'm gonna win...
Ninja wear?
What a surprise.
You won't look?
Okay. So the black ops life - it's working out for you?
They got dental?
Thanks.
I don't see our Demon.
Let me guess.
That's a big first step. So, Mr. Finn? You got an extra jet pack for a girl like me?
If that's what it takes.
Riley!
Husband.
Demon.
She's good.
How long you been married?
Mazel tov. Any kids?
Uh-huh. You do a lot of this, then? The whole husband-wife tag- team demon fighting thing?
Call this your wedding gift.
"Okay?" Wait. You guys have been tracking this thing, as a couple, for two days straight and -- you did want it dead, right?
What's a homing operation?
That would have saved me ... some trouble.
That'd be my question.
Wait -- is he your boss, too?
I ... have a house. And I think it's safe. Sometimes, you can't even leave!
So, you're what, a bounty hunter or something? I notice you're pretty good with that knife.
Well, isn't that just perfect.
Sorry if the place is a bit of a mess. I've been too busy to give it a good ...
Will. Thanks, but, no. I don't want to get all, you know -- petty.
Go nuts.
Sure. It's fine.
Which means we find the nest -- as in now -- or Sunnydale turns into the TROUBLE Meat Palace. I wish I'd said something else.
We can't track the demon. I killed it, okay? Who's hungry? We have, um ...
All you can eat.
So, demon eggs. We got a timetable on when they hatch?
Me and Sam together?
Let's go.
No problem.
Fat and jolly?
So .. Riley talks about me?
I wouldn't blame him if he called me... well you know. Called me names.
Good thing he had you.
It's just like a thirties screwball comedy.
So you improved on a classic.
He thinks I let him go.
I ... wish things were different. But I'm not trying to ... I mean I didn't -- I don't ... you know.
And work out the pain.
Well. I'm glad he's over me.
Huh. Well, you know. I'm, uh, taking my time on that one. Don't want to rush into anything, or get defined by the guy I'm with.
Sam. You think we need to split up?
No. Not at all. I just have ... an informant. He's useful. But the guy's twitchy. I show up with company, we get nothing.
Yeah, I noticed.
I need information.
I need to find a guy. Dealer. Calls himself the Doctor.
His traffic isn't.
Whatever he's doing, he's doing it soon.
Tell me you love me.
Shut up.
Oh, God...
The "Doctor'... it can't be Spike.
This isn't possible He's too ... Incompetent! It's just Spike, Riley.
I'm not saying he's good, Riley, I'm just saying he's not capable of pulling off anything as sophisticated as ...
No more games, Spike.
Not so far.
Riley, I...
I'm not exactly gun gal.
These things are never useful...
So, you and Sam go back to Central America now? Or is that classified?
Sounds fun.
And then you come, and... did you wait until your life was absolutely perfect and then send some demon here so you could throw it in my face?
Yes! I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun for the whole family!
Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow for you.
Oh please don't be --
You smelled the smell?
You know it goes away after many bathings...
I know. I kind of love her too.
No.
I never got the chance to tell you how sorry I was. About what happened with us.
He's gone.
No. I'm not here for... and I'm not gonna bust your chops about your stupid evil scheme. That's just you. I should've remembered...
Yeah. It's over.
I know that. I do want you. Being with you... makes things simpler. For a little while.
I'm using you. I can't love you. I'm just being weak, and selfish --
-- and it's killing me. I have to be strong about this.

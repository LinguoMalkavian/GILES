I’m up, mom.
No… wouldn’t want that…
I promise.
Mr. Flutie –
Bob –
Mr. Flutie. I know my transcripts are a little colorful –
It wasn’t that bad.
I did. I really did. But you gotta see the big picture. I mean, the gym was full of vamp… uh, asbestos.
Oh, thanks…
I’m new. I’m Buffy.
Thanks.
Great. Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
I’m Buffy.
Oh, great. Thanks. Where would that be?
Yeah.
Because my Mom moved, is the reason. I mean we both moved. But my Mom wanted to.
Over?
He needs to call me.
The Devil?
Oh, good.
The who?
Where’s that?
Well, I’ll try, thanks.
That sounds like fun… CUT TO:
Hello… Is anybody here?
I was looking for some, well, books. I’m new.
Good call. I guess I’m the only new kid.
Great. So you have, uh, --
That’s not what I’m looking for.
I’m way sure.
Uh, hi. Willow, right?
Why don’t we start with “hi, I’m Buffy.” And then let’s segue directly into me asking you for a favor. It doesn’t involve moving, but it does involve you hanging out with me for a while.
I can’t do both?
Look, I really want to get by here. New school… Cordelia’s been really nice – to me, anyway – but I have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes, and I heard a rumor that you were the person to talk to if I wanted to get caught up.
–or not. Or, you know, we could meet somewhere quieter. Louder. That place kind of gives me a wiggins.
He’s new?
Not at all!
Hey.
It’s nice to meeting you guys… I think.
Gee, everybody wants to know about me. How keen.
I’m not. Really.
Oh! No.
What?
Dead.
How did he die?
Well, were there any marks?
Uh, look, I gotta book. I’ll see you guys later.
Um, is there a guy in there that’s dead?
Do you know how he died?
I mean – how could this have happened?
Was there a lot of blood? Was there any blood?
I don’t. Could I just take a peek?
Never mind.
Oh, great ! CUT TO:
Okay, what’s the sitch?
You heard about the dead guy, right? The dead guy in the locker?
Well, it’s the weirdest thing. He’s got two little holes in his neck and all his blood’s been drained. Isn’t that bizarre? Aren’t you just going, “Ooooh….”
Well, I wasn’t! It’s my first day. I was afraid that I’d be behind in all the classes, that I wouldn’t make any friends, that I’d have last month’s hair. I didn’t think there would be vampires on campus. And I don’t care .
To tell you that I don’t care. Which I don’t, and… have now told you. So bye.
Who?
No, he’s just dead.
To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood and then you have to suck their blood, it’s a whole big sucking thing. Mostly they’ll just take all your blood and then you just die – why am I still talking to you?
Oh, why can’t you leave me alone?
The stop the spread of their evil blah blah I’ve heard it, okay?
Well, I have both been there and done that. And I am moving on.
It’s two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus.
Like Vampires.
What, did you send away for the Time Life series?
Did you get the free phone?
Cool. Okay, first of all, I’m a vampire slayer. And secondly, I’m retired. Hey, I know! Why don’t you kill them?
Oh, come on. Stake through the heart, a little sunlight – it’s like falling off a log.
Watches?
Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? Losing all my friends? Having to spend all my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because it might ‘endanger’ them? Go ahead. Prepare me.
What’s getting worse?
Because now is the time my mom moved here .
Gee, can you vague that up for me…?
Come on. This is Sunnydale. How bad an evil can there be here?
Hi! I’m an enormous slut! Hi! Would you like a copy of the Watchtower? I used to be so good at this…
Yeah, Mom. I’m going to a club.
No, Mom; it’s a nun club.
I will.
Great.
Mom…
I know.
It is. From now on, I’m only hanging out with the living. I – I mean, the lively… people.
There’s a problem. Why are you following me?
What do you want?
Okay, what do I want?
Sorry! That’s incorrect but you do get this lovely watch and a year’s worth of Turtle Wax what I want … is to be left alone.
For what?
Who are you?
Well, maybe I don’t want a friend.
Hi!
Are you here with someone?
Oh, are you guys going out?
How come?
Oh.
Why not?
It’s not that bad. It is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.
You really haven’t been dating lately.
Oh, yeah. Real easy.
Well, my philosophy is – do you wanna hear my philosophy?
Life is short.
Not original, I’ll grant you. But it’s true. Why waste time being all shy? Why worry about some guy and if he’s gonna laugh at you? You know? Seize the moment. ‘Cause tomorrow you might be dead.
Uh, I’ll be back in a minute.
I’ll be back in a minute .
So, you like to party with the students? Isn’t that kind of skanky?
STAT .
That the Harvest is coming, I know, your friend told me.
The… Harvest. That means something to you? ‘Cause I’m drawing a blank.
This guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way. I figured you were buds.
Something about the mouth of Hell. I really didn’t like him.
Lucky them…
I didn’t say I’d never slay another vampire. I’m just not gonna get way extracurricular with it. If I run into one, sure…
You’re like a textbook with arms! I know this!
Maybe?
There’s one.
Down there. Talking to that girl.
Oh, please. Look at his jacket. He’s got the sleeves rolled up. And the shirt… Deal with that outfit for a moment.
It’s carbon dated! Trust me: only someone who’s been living underground for ten years would think that was the look.
Oh, no…
Willow.
Seizing the moment.
Cordelia!
Did you guys see Willow? Did she come by here?
I didn’t find them.
No, but my social life is on the critical list.
You go on. I’ll take care of it.
Don’t worry. One vampire I can handle.
Xander, have you seen Willow?
I need to find her. She left with a guy.
Where would they go?
Was there a school bulletin? Was it in the news? Is there anybody in this town who doesn’t know I’m a slayer?
Whatever. Just tell me where Willow would go.
We don’t find her, there’s gonna be another dead body in the morning.
Well, this is nice.
A little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows – call it home.
Wow, you mean there’s actually somebody around here who doesn’t know already? That’s a relief. I’m telling you, having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.
Okay, first of all, what’s with this outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge. Now, we can do this the hard way, or… well, actually, there’s just the hard way.
You sure? It’s not gonna be pretty. We’re talking violence, strong language, adult content.
See what happens when you roughhouse?
Xander, go.
You know, I just wanted to start over. Be like everybody else. Have some friends, maybe a dog… But no. You had to come here. You couldn’t go suck on some other town.
Don’t you know?
Hey, I had other plans, too, okay?
I’m up, mom.
No… wouldn’t want that…
I promise.

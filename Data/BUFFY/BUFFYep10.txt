No!
Oh, Mom...
No... yeah, I'm... school, great.
Sure, why not?
He's coming, right?
Good...
Not a whole lot. He's still in L.A. He only comes down for weekends sometimes.
Well, it wasn't finalized till last year. They were separated before that.
That's the word you're looking for. I mean, they were really good about it- around me, anyway. But still...
I didn't ask for all the details. They just stopped getting along. I'm sure I was a big help. With the slaying and everything, I was a mess. Lotta trouble.
No.
Sometimes.
It's the hair.
Chapter five. Active listening. Where you put on your "big ears" and really focus on the other person?
She was wearing that tight sweater?
I didn't sleep so good.
Not really... Oh no, my bag. I packed for the weekend and I forgot it.
Okay, I just - I meant to bring it. He is picking me up here,right? At 3:30?
No. I mean, not really. Should I be?
Thanks. And Mom, don't worry, I'm over the divorce. I officially release you from all guilt.
You, too.
It was pretty intense.
A little blasé ´here, aren't you?
Thanks for having confidence in me.
Well, Giles said he was going to look up - Giles?
Hey. Giles. Wakey wakey.
Okay. If he can still talk.
Hey Wendell, how're you doing?
You okay?
We just thought you might want to talk about what happened.
I don't know. Has anything like that ever happened before?
When?
What history test?
There's a test? Nobody told me about a... I better, I gotta... we'll catch up during lunch.
I, uh -
I was there the first day... I think.
I haven't been to class, I haven't read any of the assignments... how am I going to pass the test?
I know my name.
I think they said room 316
Laura? To say Hi to. She's nice enough. Nobody saw who attacked her?
Hey, Laura.
Can you tell us what happened?
Someone you knew?
It.
That's okay. Don't worry about it.
But if you remember anything, you can tell us. Even if it seems... weird.
Friends.
Easy?
The first what?
Somebody will.
Hit the newspapers. See what you can find out about this first attack.
Hospital lighting. It does nothing for my fabulous complexion.
I'll sleep better when we find this guy. Nothing like kicking the crap out of a bad guy to perk up my day.
What's the word?
Uh-huh.... Did you find anything?
You don't know if you didn't find anything?
What is it?
What do you mean? You can read, like, three languages.
That's him.
That's the boy I've been seeing around school.
"Twelve year old Billy Palmer was found beaten and unconscious after his Kiddie League game Saturday. Doctors describe his condition as critical..." When was this published? Last week (to Giles) He's in a coma, in intensive care... this is the boy from the hospital.
Yes, when the spiders got Wendell, when I didn't know a thing on the history test... It seemed weird, him being around, but with all the trouble I forgot about it.
What am I, knowledge girl now? Explanations are your terrain.
He's in a coma. That's like sleep, right?
Could I have been seeing Billy's asteroid body?
(looking at the picture) Lucky Nineteen...
Dad, what are you... you're not supposed to pick me up till after school, is something wrong?
Something is wrong. Is it Mom?
Phew. You really had me -
Sure. Oh, this is Mr. Giles, the librarian. This is my father, Hank Summers.
I'll be back...
You always said-
Well, yeah. Isn't that true?
Was there... someone else?
Well then what was it?
Me?
What?
...no. Please don't.
Why are you saying these things?
Are you Billy Palmer?
Because I want to help you.
Did something bad happen to you last week, after your Kiddie League Game?
Do you remember playing baseball?
Are you "lucky nineteen"?
Who?
Why does he want to kill you?
It's okay, you can tell me. He's what?
Run, Billy!
Billy-
Billy, who is he?
I can't fight him. I can fight anything but I can't fight him. He's too strong. We've got to find my friends. They can help.
He'll find us.
I was sure this led to the library.
They're just playing... what is it, what's scaring you?
Did you lose your Kiddie League game last week?
Why was it your fault?
You missed a ball and the whole game's your fault? What, you were the only one playing, there weren't eight other kids on your team?
Who said? (nothing from Billy) Did he... hurt you after the game?
Sure we can. We can go around behind the cafeteria...
...bad idea. Come on!
What just happened?
(looking about her) No. It's not.
Well, I don't see the Ugly Guy... I also don't see where the sun and the rest of the world went...
You...
This isn't real... you can't be Free.
This is a dream...
Nooooo!
I thought I was dead...
Oh, God, no... no...
Don't look at me...
This isn't a dream.
He's afraid.
Yes. I can.
But we'd better hurry. I'm getting Hungry.
From him.
I think I know.
I'm glad you showed up. You see, I'm having a really bad day.
Scary. I'll tell you something though. There's a lot scarier things out there than you. And now, I'm one of them.
Come here, Billy.
No more hiding.
You're got to do the rest.
Awake...
You blamed him for losing the game . So you caught up with him afterwards.
Nice goin'.
Hard to believe a Kiddie League Coach would do something like that.
That was kinda heroic, Xander, grabbing him and all.
Have a killer weekend, guys.
Great.
Oh you know, the usual...

Where's Spike?
Spike, Xander -- Is he here?
Any idea where he went?
I hope not.
Spike can't be doing this, Xander. He couldn't if he wanted to.
Well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.
It's working. I've seen it.
You think it's an act?
No, there's something... He's different. Changed. I feel it. If it's an act, then the Oscar goes to...
Trouble...
Spike...
Just one. Vampire. Used to be someone I knew. A little. His name was Holden. Holden Webster.
Yeah.
Sun's coming up. I have to go home. Check on Dawn. We need to keep an eye on Spike.
Xander, this is serious. We can't let him go out again until we know if he's killing people. We have to find someone to watch him.
Dawn?
What the hell happened? Downstairs looks like...
Oh, god... and it started with Dawn?!
Dawn actually saw what? Willow, who did she --
Dawnie...
Lies...
A vampire I killed last night told me Spike sired him. Two nights ago.
I can't... I really hope not.
Got it. I'm on it. Thanks. What? Of course you're not fat, why would you...
I'm sorry.
What?
It's okay. Give me the ticket.
Seriously, it's fine. Just give it to me. Officer.
You've got to be kidding me...
Yeah, I've been saying that about me for years...
Evening, Spike.
You know you want it.
There's my guy.
Did you kill her?
The girl. Last night.
I caught the first act. Missed the curtain. Did you kill her? Turn her? Is she one of your kind now?
Answer me, Spike. Where's that girl?
Looked like more than talking-
Right, the chip. But-
So you just troll the promenade for drunk co-eds because you're hungry for conversation .
What?
Don't play games, not now-
Don't flatter yourself-
It's not a story! This vampire I killed, he told me-
Spike-
I know. But-
Spike. This vampire told me you were his sire.
He said you killed him last week. Dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.
I did follow you last night. You didn't look casual. Or lonely. You looked like you were on the prowl.
So what were you doing? Just tell me. You picked up that girl. Then what?
All you remember?
So if you forget so much-
Spike. You were camped on the Hellmouth talking to invisible people. Recently. How can you be sure what you've been-
So I'll get some.
Guys, find me some evidence that he did this, okay?
Or find me some proof he didn't. I don't know.
We can't assume anything. We need hard facts.
But?
Maybe. But it still doesn't prove it's Spike. Right now, he's still the only one knows who for sure.
He hit you?
Any idea where he was headed?
I need some help. I'm looking for this guy -- bleached-blonde hair, leather jacket, British accent, kinda... sallow, but in a hot way --
Actually, Billy Idol stole his look from... Never mind. Has he been here?
No . I just need to find him. As soon as possible.
How many girls?
Where are you?
I'll meet you.
Hello? Spike?
All right. So what do you need to show me?
Spike.
Oh God, Spike. Why?
What is it?
Oh god.
Spike! No!
Sorry, ma'am. It's my job.
Who said?
What are you talking about?
There's something here.
Something's playing with us, Spike. All of us.
I don't know.
I'll help you.
You didn't see him down there. He really didn't know what he'd done. Like it wasn't in his control.
Maybe. I'm not letting him Out of my sight. That is for sure.
I'm not keeping him around just to help him. I think... I think there was something there. Talking to him. Making him do things.
Yeah, maybe. And if it is the same thing, it's been screwing with Spike big time.
Look, something evil is working us. If we're going to have a chance against it, we'll have to learn everything we can about it. This thing has been closer to Spike than any of us.
I'm going to have to get close to Spike.
I don't have a choice. What ever this thing - "From beneath us" is - it's bad. And it's only getting worse.
Where's Spike?

Three in one night. Giles would be so proud.
Morning. Wow. That damage looks fairly structural. Are we safe in here?
Do I have something on my face?
How're you doing there, Giles? You get much sleep?
Me too! Yes I went hunting last night and it's awfully sweet of you to ask.
It's getting hairy out there, Giles. I killed three vampires last night. One of them was practically on school grounds.
And they're getting cockier. I'm not loving it. Last night was a pretty close call.
Giles, CARE. I'm putting my life on the line, battling the undead! I broke a nail, okay? I'm wearing a press-on. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest. You could go, "Hmmmm" .
That's okay. I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet my terrible fate.
Biology.
Wow, that was... boring.
No, "boring" falls short.
Don't say that.
What on earth is her deal?
Okay. What's up?
Okay, now you're making me nervous.
Well?
Xander, I don't know what to say...
Xander... You're one of my best friends. The best friends I've ever had. You and Willow, I mean, I love you guys so much --
I don't want to spoil the friendship we have.
I don't. I'm sorry. I just don't think of you that way.
Xander...
That's really harsh.
I never meant to --
Giles? You're not gonna believe --
Angel...?
So that's it, huh? My time is up. I remember the drill. "One Slayer dies, the next is called." I wonder who the next one is. Are you gonna train her? Or will they send someone else.
Does it say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt?
Don't touch me!
Were you guys even gonna tell me?
Oh, I've got a way around it. I quit.
I'm making it that simple! I quit! I resign! I'm fired! Someone else can stop the Master from taking over.
The signs?
Read me the signs! Tell me my fortune! You're so useful, sitting around with your books. You're really a lot of help.
What do you know about it? You're never gonna die.
I already have. I quit, remember? Pay attention.
I don't care! I don't care. I'm sixteen years old. And I don't want to die.
I guess.
Mom, let's go away.
Anywhere. Just for a while. A weekend.
It'll be great. You and me. A mother daughter thing. We'll talk about all that embarrassing stuff you like to bring up.
Mom... please?
I guess so.
Someone, but...
Mom, we can't afford this.
It's beautiful.
I can't go to the dance.
Was it awful?
Then what happened?
And he didn't have a date either?
You had your whole life ahead of you.
That must be nice.
It's okay...
Willow, as long as you're okay --
What we have to.
You'll stay in tonight, all right?
Tomorrow.
Take care.
No you're not.
So I'm looking for a kid, huh? He'll take me to the Master.
You're still not going up against the Master.
So have I.
It's not how it goes. I'm the Slayer.
I know.
When he wakes up, tell him... I don't know. Think of something cool, tell him I said it.
Maybe... But maybe I'll take him with me.
It's all right. I know who you are.
Let's go.
Thanks for having me. You really ought to talk to your contractor. I think you've got some water damage.
Don't be so sure.
For somebody all-powerful, you sure do like to hide.
I don't.
Xander... ?
The Master...
No, I'm not. I feel strong. I feel... different.
Let's go.
I know.
Oh, look. A bad guy.
You wait here. Keep the rest of the vampires off me.
Angel, better put on your game face.
One way or another, this won't take long.
I don't think it's yours just yet.
I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.
What can I say? I flunked the written.
You've got fruit punch mouth.
And save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.
You're really that amped about Hell?
Go there.
I'm sorry. It's been a really weird day.
Sure. We saved the world. I say we party. (looks at her tattered dress) I mean, I got all pretty...
He's not going anywhere. Loser.
I'm hungry. Is anybody else hungry? I'm really hungry.
Do I have something on my face?
How're you doing there, Giles? You get much sleep?

Yeah? You want it?
I know you're backing away.
Let her go, Caleb.
No, she doesn't. She hasn't got time. She's got friends - and her friends are in trouble.
Sure you are. And then you're coming back for it later. When she's got her back turned.
It's hers for now . Let her go.
Get the wounded. We're leaving.
There's always more. Let's move.
Willow! C'mere. This girl's losing blood.
The room upstairs is ready for her.
I'll be up in a second.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I took it from Caleb. Might be important.
What?
That wasn't her fault. It was a trap. I could've fallen for it as easy as her.
I don't know. I guess I'm not leaving.
Yeah, there's a plan. Get ready. Time's up.
We've still got work to do.
I think it's... maybe some kind of scythe? Only thing I know for sure is, it made Caleb back off in a hurry.
Kills strong bodies three ways.
Not much, just... it's strong. And I knew it belonged to me. I mean, I just knew it.
Yeah, I figured that when I King- Arthur'd it out of that stone.
Yeah, well, the good guys aren't traditionally known for their communication skills.
The First's guys were clearly trying to get it out of that stone. It's not just some tool; it's important. Find out whatever you can: Who made it, why. And when. Does it have a name? And, I dunno, a credit report? Find out fast .
Thanks, because right now, this thing's all we've got going for us.
You got it?
You know it's for the good.
Of course I'm not putting you out to pasture... What does that even mean?
I'm not.
I know. That's why you're doing this. I need someone I can count on. No matter what happens.
Hey --
Thanks a lot.
I know what you meant.
You will be. You're my strength, Xander. I never would have made it this far without you.
Also, you can't shoot a bow and arrow anymore and every time you swing a sword I worry you're gonna break one of our good lamps.
Don't look at me. You're the one who said I'm gonna die.
Yeah, okay. Sure.
Not that I care personally, but you're wasting a lot of robust, full- bodied merlot.
We'll get her. Calm down.
She's powerful now. And you're weak.
Face it. Your strength is waning. It's been a while since we've... merged.
Boy, you really know how to romance a girl. No flowers, no dinner, no tour of the rectory... just "let's do it." Help me. My knees are weak.
Oh, for me as well... When this is over -- when our armies spring forth and our will sweeps the world -- I'll be able to enter every man, woman and child on the face of this Earth.
I'm trying to make you a god.
You feel it too, don't you.
I know.
It belongs to the Slayer.
I honestly don't know. Does it matter?
It's not your fault.
You're not?
You didn't blow it.
People die. You lead them into battle, they die. No matter how smart you are, or how ready, war is about death. Needless, stupid death.
Was that the funny part? Did I miss --
No no. Sorry. Go.
Principal Wood? And you? And on my...
No! No! We're just good friends. Or mortal enemies, depending on which day of the... is this the funny part?
Yeah.
I love my friends, and I'm grateful for them, but yeah, that's the price. Being the Slayer.
Also, you went evil and were killing people.
But you're right. I mean, I guess everyone's alone, but... Being a Slayer. There's a burden we can't share.
Takes the edge off.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Right now we're going with scythe. You like?
I'm sorry about that.
Great. I got work to do.
Yeah. It is.
I'm not shirty. What is even shirty, that's not a word!
It's not a secret. I mean it is, but that's the point of the mission, find the secret. This was forged by... we don't know, something about a tomb on unconsecrated ground... I gotta find out what this is, why I have it.
That it is.
Great.
You're a dope!
You're a dope, and a bonehead, and, and you're shirty.
You see this? This may actually help me fight my war. It may be the key to everything and the reason I'm holding it is 'cause of you. Because of last night, the strength you gave me. I'm tired of defensiveness and weird mixed signals -- I've got Faith for that. Let's just get to the truth. I don't know how you feel about last night, but I'm not gonna --
Of what?
Spike...
I just told you it did.
You don't have to be.
I was.
I don't know. Does it have to mean something?
Maybe, when --
'kay.
Who are you?
So, what are you? Some kind of ghost?
What is it?
Buffy.
Yeah. Met them. Didn't care for 'em.
Oh! So you're like... What are you?
Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.
Does this mean I can win?
Yes.
Oh.
Angel.
You look timely. And also good.
Really kinda is.
See?
That bitch.
Yeah? You want it?
I know you're backing away.
No, she doesn't. She hasn't got time. She's got friends - and her friends are in trouble.

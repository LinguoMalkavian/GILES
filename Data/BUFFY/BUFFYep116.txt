I know. But it's my duty...
No, cuz that would be totally unfair. We all must participate equally in the cosmic joke of bridesmaids-dom.
I think Anya's way too stressed to think right now, what with Xander's relatives and her... demons...
I can't believe everyone is buying the story that Anya's people are "circus folk." The thing with the tentacles, what's he s'posed to be, Inky the Squid Boy?
Kinda. Mr. Harris threw up in my purse.
Nah.
It'll fit.
And... so... you... SHALL.
Slayer strength.
You look really great, Mr. About- to-get-married. You're glowing.
Oh, good teary.
Yes. Happy. Happy for you.
Let's see. We found your shoes and your fly is zipped up. I'd say you're ready to get married. You're one of the decent ones, Xander. I hope I get as lucky as you guys someday.
Alright, into the breach with you.
Don't let your dad near the bar.
Don't let your mom near the bar.
A--
Wait, Spike brought a date?
Oh yeah, go. I'll just be a sec.
Mazaltov!
You must be so happy for Xander on his special, once-in-a-lifetime day, Mr. Harris.
I could really go for a strong cup of coffee. Hey, let's get you one too.
I did.
Finish that sentence and I guarantee you won't have anything to show.
Hey.
Haven't met. She seems like a very nice attempt at making me jealous.
No, no... I mean, you have the right to... I mean I pretty much deserve...
I know.
Go where? To your place?
Yeah.
Of course.
I will.
That's because my dress is radioactive.
Yeah.
(just as quiet) Welcome.
Are you ready, Ahn?
What! Xander's gone? What do we do?
Sorry about that. Uh, it looks like there's going to be a little delay.
Nothing, nothing. Just, um, the, uh, minister! He's got to go perform an emergency...C-section and, uh--
Oh yes, he's a doctor as well as a minister. He's like, half- minister, half-doctor. A mini- tor. Not, of course, to be confused with a minotaur! Because he's all man, this minister-doctor man, no bull parts, whatsoever.
So anyway, it oughta just be a couple of minutes.
No, no... This isn't it... It's not what you think...
So...who here's from out of town?
Hey, break it up!
Anya!
Yep.
I know. The whole thing hurts my heart.
They were. I know they were. They were my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.

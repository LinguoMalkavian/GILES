I was kinda feeling like a tool and now I know why.
Holy crap.
Uh, yeah. The cow and chicken coming together even though they never met... It was like Sleepless in Seattle if Tom and Meg were, like, minced.
Right, you mentioned that a couple times when I filled out the application.
Well, I need money pretty quickly so I didn't want to go through a whole big interview process. I'm supporting my younger sister and we've had some expenses-
I guess.
But if I brought something from home, I could eat it here?
What happened?
There's someone's stuff.
Sure they're not coming back? They're not getting far naked!
(genuinely confused) Are they going to do something?
Lifers?
Wow. They're all so identical.
Not the employees. I meant the chicken slices.
What's in here?
Yeah, I know the Medley. But the video was kinda... graphic with the slaughter--
Well, I had a big breakfast... But it smells so...
So what's the deal with Manny the Manager? And if I ask him nice, can I write a children's book called that?
Fill this? I didn't know there was gonna be drug-testing.
What? Why?
I prefer the one that goes "Manny's a humorless dolt that picks the pocket of he should bite me."
You hit so many buttons. It was like... buttonpalooza...
Ahh.
Hi. I'm new.
That's nice.
Oh... good.
Welcome to the Doublemeat Palace. May I help you?
I'm sorry. This button. Does it look chocolatey to you?
Sorry, I was curious.
Theory number five: cat-burgers.
Wow, thanks! This is so cool of you.
I don't know. I've waitressed before, but this is different.
Oh. In L.A., that summer. It was a diner, and we had, you know, people who didn't tip, and lots of funny, funny health code violations, but it wasn't like this. There's something wrong here. Will? You okay?
The manager's all like, mysterious and scary. And there's this secret ingredient, and the people that work here are strange. They sort of, tare into space, plus they disappear...
Not poof. Well, I don't think so.
I didn't say "demons." I'm just saying there's a vibe. You haven't seen this manager.
Again, I never actually said "demons." Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's just the video that's creeping me out. The cow and the chicken all swirly together...
Cool. You got it. On me.
Here you go. One Medley Meal. Plus I doublesized your fries...
I'm probably kidding.
Slow night.
Thus quoth Manny. But, thing is, there's no one here!
Oh, this'll make the day complete.
Go away. I'm working.
Order something or go.
I'm not a demon. I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
I'll be fine.
Please don't make this any harder.
I need the money.
Yeah...
Feels like I just left, ya know?
(wishing she hadn't) Yeah, I came back.
Gary? The counter guy that helped me out? What do you mean?
But the shift is just starting.
He must just be late. He didn't seem like he was going anywhere.
Me?
But I don't know how to grill.
Repeat until insane.
Got it. Variety is the spice of Bad.
What's the secret ingredient?
What does that mean?
But what is it?
(as if it makes sense) Ohhh.
Um, that's okay.
Oh.
Imagine that
Yay, it's Manny.
What? Another eight hours? Right after these eight hours? That's... so many hours.
Um... what happened? Why the double shiftiness?
But they could still show up, right? I mean, they could be anywhere.
Look! This was under the grinder!
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Try again.
This isn't six weeks old. This is new!
Right. Maybe Gary's in the hospital. Or maybe he's in the grinder! Huh? "Meat process"?! "Secret Ingredient'?! Maybe he's on the grill! Maybe he's under the pickle chips!
Stop eating! No! Stop!
It's people! The Doublemeat Medley is people!!!!
I call an emergency meeting and this is it? Where's Willow? Where's Anya?
There's something wrong at the Doublemeat Palace. Really wrong.
No, I'm talking about-- I smell funny?
I'm not certain. It might be this nice guy named Gary, only one there who didn't seem all brain-dead. He didn't show up this morning. Except now I think he was there the whole time. As the secret ingredient. We have to analyze that burger, find out if it used to be people--
Xander! You ate it?
We were supposed to analyze that! I can't just go back there and get another!
I bet it's not just this one time, or even this one town. There are Doublemeat Palaces all over California.
We all have. Everyone has. They've got the perfect deal. Everyone expects high turnover of the employees, the meat costs them nothing and... and... They've got us disposing of the bodies! How sick is that? We gotta take down the whole company. Willow, Xander ate the burger. Can you still figure out for sure what it was?
You guys work on that. I'm going back. It's after closing now, I can sneak around, see what I find.
Manny?
Scalp!
Para... paralyzed. I think... it's wearing off.
Oh. Hi... You must be the new manager. I'm Buffy Summers.
Yeah, I think... I think that used to happen here a lot.
Um, yeah. Practical jokes not really right for the workplace. I so get that now. Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform. It got, it's kinda torn.
The Doublemeat Medley is vegetables.
So I guess it's true.
Wait. The secret ingredient in your beef is... beef?
Um... yeah. I get that. It is a valuable secret, isn't it?
I really need money.
No! Well, yes. I mean, I want to work. I have zero money coming in, and I'd really like, I'd like to not be fired anymore.
I promise.
That's, that's great. And I can do the job, I promise that too.
Right. Here on out.

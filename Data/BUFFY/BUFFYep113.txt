We missed the bed again.
Is this a new rug?
This place is okay for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up.
What? No. Sort of.
What?
That's the plan. Soon as my legs start working again.
You, uh, got the job done too.
I'm not an animal.
It's late. I should try to catch Dawn before she goes to bed.
Where's my underwear?
Sometimes.
Never.
Double meat is double sweet! Enjoy!
Time has no meaning here. Gina, I'm taking a break.
Then this'll be quite a heist.
If you close your eyes and repeatedly smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away. Eventually. I'm hoping. Thanks for coming by.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Wha -- no! Tara, this isn't about Willow.
No, God, I'm sorry. Willow's fine. She's been doing so much better, she really has. You'd be proud or her.
It's, um, Spike. He... He can hurt me.
No, it still works. Just... not on me. Tara, I need to know about the spell. The one that brought me back. I'd ask Willow, but --
I don't know. But I feel... different. There are things, things that I don't... I think maybe I came back wrong.
Can you check the spell, see if there's anything that could have... Can you just check? Please?
I'm home. Who wants to help scrape the grease off -- oh my God!
I'm leaning more towards an ungainly collapse.
Kinda.
I think I'll just hang with Dawn tonight. Cuddle up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and -
And I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
Oh.
I know, I'm sorry. But I'm here now. All visible and everything. Couldn't you stay with Janice some other night?
Frosty nectar. Now please.
You're still doing okay, right?
I'm sorry I haven't been around much.
What?
A girl can dream.
I'll catch the next Soul Train out.
Glass all the way empty. More nectar required.
Don't.
Don't think about the evil bloodsucking fiend... focus on anything but the evil bloodsucking --
Yeah huh?
It's all right. I'm going to get you out of here. Can you walk? Are you hurt -
Spike?
Spike. What's happening?
I don't know. Things are... jumbled.
She's dead. I - I killed her.
What happened?
What did I do...
She's dead.
I killed her.
No--
Hey.
Late. I just wanted to... I love you. You know that, right?
I know I haven't been everything I should be... everything Mom was... but I love you. I always will.
There was an accident. In the woods. A girl -- she... she was hurt. I hurt someone.
No.
I have to do this.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
No, that's not true.
Dawn --
Nothing. I have to go do something. Look after Dawn for me, okay?
The right thing. For once.
I have to tell them what happened.
I killed that girl.
I'll show them. I'll take them there and show them what I did.
What did you do?
What did you do?!
It doesn't matter.
I killed her.
Nothing just happens.
Let me go, Spike. Please. Just let me go...
No, you don't.
Try harder.
It's not your choice.
A girl is dead because of me.
That's all it is to you, isn't it? Just another body!
You can't understand why this is killing me, can you?!
I'm not your girl!
Excuse me. I need to, um...
Warren.
Yeah. That's it.
That's why time want all David Lynch?
It wasn't the demons. It was Warren. He knew Katrina. He had something to do with this. I know it.
Because you always hurt the one you love.
Yeah, honey. I'm not going anywhere.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
I didn't come back wrong.
You must have missed something. Check again.
There has to be!
He's everything I hate. Everything I'm suppose to be against. But the only time I feel anything is when we... Don't tell anyone. Please.
The way they would look at me... I couldn't.
You don't know how hard it is. Lying to everyone you love about who you're sleeping with.
Why can't I stop? Why do I keep letting him in?
Using him? What's okay about that?
It is! It's wrong. I'm wrong... Tell me that I'm wrong...

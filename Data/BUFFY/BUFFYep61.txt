Parker?
It’s nothing.
Stop flicking at me.
Frere means brother.
There's more to it than wiping and kicking.
Mixing drinks comes to mind.
Well, Xander, even if I had a pretend cigarette, I couldn't tell you my problems. Real ones have clogged up my headspace.
Class time.
You know, it's probably just him, having trouble dealing, right? I mean, sometimes, guys keep the girls they really like inside these little deep-brain, fantasy bubbles where things are always perfect.
So, maybe, I'm in his bubble. And pretty soon, he'll just realize he wants more than just Bubble-Buffy. And, he'll pop me out and we'll have dinner and stuff. Guys totally do that, right?
But he can be really sweet. You know, I think he has intimacy issues, 'cause of his father dying -
Oh! Sorry.
In my defense, you take up a lot of space.
Uh, no, I… saw Parker there…
(fishing, not thrilled) He's kind of a girl chaser, huh?
Sorry, what?
Uh huh…
It's just… Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it. And I knew that, I knew what he was, but… You know, if he were tied up and gagged and left in a cave that vampires HAPPENED to frequent that wouldn't really be like I killed him really…
I'm a slut.
A big, lecherous loser.
I'm better. This has helped.
Sorry. I'm bumping into people today.
My mother always says that beer is evil.
I’m not really sure.
You guys just love to hear yourselves speak, don’t you?
Well, I don’t hate this, for a start.
TV is a good thing. Bright colors, music… little tiny people.
I'm suffering the after-ness of a bad night of badness.
No, with five really smart guys.
I went to see Xander, but then I saw Parker and… then came beer.
Pfah… gutter-face, no! Just lots 'n lots 'o beer. It's nice. Foamy and comforting. It's beer.
Okay.
She read the… reading.
Sure, why wouldn’t I be?
S'good… good enough!
Yeah. Foamy.
You're stupid!
Smelly head.
No, you .
Hey!
It sings!
Like it.
Want more singing. Want more… beer.
Did it hurt?
No. Like beer. Beer…good.
Say bye.
Bye.
Parker bad!
Want people. Where people go?
WANT! Want people!
Boy smell nice.
Beer! Want beer!
Want beer.
Fire…bad!
AAHOOWW!
Bad, bad, bad…
Tired.
Foamy.
Parker?
It’s nothing.

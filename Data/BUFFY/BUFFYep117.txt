Oh. Hi.
What?
Okay. Sounds good.
I could wrestle naked in grease for a living and still be cleaner than after a shift at the Doublemeat.
So, what'you doing?
Oh. Any luck?
Maybe Anya found him, and they're working it out... Hey, how come you're all about home and hearth and DSL? I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
Ow. I got a little scratch from all the brittle.
What? You mean...
Oh, Will. I'm so sorry.
I'm sure they're just friends. When someone falls for Willow, they stay fallen.
Are you okay?
You don't need to apologize to us.
We thought maybe you guys'd find each other.
She was kinda, she got a little broken.
No. Well... there were probably better times to break up with her--
You still want to date ?
Hey, we all screw up. And who knows, sometimes life gives us what we need anyway.
Really not.
What?
You didn't hear?
No. Well, yeah, absolutely. But the thing is, Xander left. Wedding didn't happen.
It was awful. Anya was... she was devastated.
And Xander. He's got this idea maybe they can still get back together, but... he hurt her a lot.
Oh. Hey, guys I was, I found Spike here, and I was just trying to find out what he was doing with...
Guys...
Guys... don't...
Whe. . . what is this?
Sunnydale...
Mom...?
No...
I'm -- I'm... fine.
I've been having these... flashes. Hallucinations, I guess.
Night before last. I was checking houses on the list you put together, looking for Warren and his pals. Then bam. Some kind of gross, waxy demon thing poked me.
More like a melted candle.
In the arm. It stung me or something, and then it was like I -- No. Not like. I was in an institution.
I didn't know what it was at first. But then it happened a couple more times. There were doctors, nurses, other patients...
I know how it sounds. But it all felt so... real.
No, it... Mom was there.
And dad too. They were together. Like they used to be. Before Sunnydale...
Enemies... Warren... Jonathan... They did this to me...
Dawn?...
Will... I feel so lost.
It's more. Even before the demon. I've been so... detached.
But it's been so long... And every day I try to snap out of it. To figure out why I'm like that. Well... maybe this is why.
Yes I have.
Back when I saw my first vampires... I got so scared. I told my parents about it. And they freaked out. Figured there was something seriously wrong with me. They sent me to a clinic.
I was only there a couple of weeks. I stopped talking about it so they let me go. And eventually, my parents just... forgot.
What if I never left? What if I'm still in that clinic?
Alone? Willow, he can't. It's too strong.
Oh. Thanks.
I should be taller than you.
Coming apart...
We have to try harder. Make things better.
Your grades... ...stealing... and Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?
We have to deal with these things, Dawn. We --
Dawn...
I don't have a sister. I know. I didn't grow up with her, but then these monks, they made ...
What?
Dawn, I didn't mean...
What happened?
Thank you, Will. You never stop coming through.
You need to leave me alone. You're not a part of my life...
I don't wanna go back there. I wanna be healthy again. What do I need to do?
Mom... please, help me. I wanna go home. With dad and you.
Slaying?
My friends.
I'm... still pretty dazed. But better.
Thanks.
Um... yeah. I'm better now.
Dawn!?
I called for you.
Where do you think you're going?
You're not going anywhere.
I care. You're going downstairs with the others. It's the only way I'll get healthy.
I know. You're just a trap for my mind.
Sure it is... 'Cause what's more real?
Or some type of. . . supergirl. Chosen to fight demons and save the world? That's ridiculous.
I don't know I don't know I don't know...
Xander...
Willow!
You're right... Thank you. Goodbye.
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
No...

(calling them out) All right. Let's make this quick.
Okay. Now that's gonna cost you.
Oh, guys, you didn't have to -- I mean, if you want to be alone --
Great.
I love you more!
We're just jealous. True love.
Baby carriage.
Well. I found their lair, but they must've know we were tracing their signal. They left in hurry -- their van was gone, but everything else was still there.
There's nothing left. Giant buzz saws. It was a thing. This was all I could save. I know it's not much, but we need to look for anything that might tell us where they're going, what they're planning.
Anything we can do to fast forward? We need to find Warren and the others before anyone else gets hurt.
I don't think he's in the Scooby space. Let's give him same time.
Spike's not -- He's not a part of the group.
I don't know, Dawn. Not for a while.
I'm guessing she's not feeling all researchy right now.
Hey.
Thanks. Still a little early for me.
So how many coup d' etats is that?
Xander, she loves you. You know that. What Anya did... She was just hurting, Xander. She was hurting and she did this really stupid thing.
He's not my boyfriend.
You don't know how hard it's been.
Being here. After I was brought back... You have no idea how hard it is just being here.
You didn't want to know.
What I do with my life is none of your business.
It just happened, okay.
Xander, you fought side by side with him when I was gone. You let him take care of Dawn --
You're asking me that? Right, 'cause your decision making skills have really sparkled lately.
It doesn't matter. I'm not seeing him anymore. It's over.
(exchanging blows) Not bad. How hard you donna hit when you're blowin' in the wind?
Get out.
I really don't.
You spoke. I listened. You leave.
Why?
Then you might want to try the not sleeping with my friends.
You were going to use a spell on me?
I couldn't.
You know why.
(softly, honestly) No. I don't.
I'm not saying I don't have feelings for you. I do. But it's not love. I could never trust you enough for it to become that.
Until there's nothing left. That kind of love doesn't last.
Spike --
Stop it...
Don't --
Stop it... please... stop...
Don't...
Please...
Spike, stop...
STOP!
Because I stopped you. Something I should have done a long time ago.
He tried. He didn't...
Don't.
Nothing.
What do you got that doesn't rhyme?
To what?
(eyeing printouts) I can't cover all of these at once.
Good. I won't have to hold back.
'Cause if not, there's gonna be a fee for that.
You really got a problem with strong women, don't you?
It's getting better.
There's two ways this can end. And right about now I'm thinking they're both gonna hurt.
You're a murderer.
I'll remember that when I knock 'em clean out of your --
Good night, bitch.
Oh come on.
Just making sure there's no more Evil Trio cameras. Or Evil Uno.
Warren. Jonathan and Andrew got klinked, but Warren pulled a Rocket Man. It was a thing.
No. He won't.
Scenic route. Long drive.
I know.
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
Guess we've both done a lot of things lately we're not proud of.
Wanna compare?
Let's not find out.

Giles...
Willow. Listen to him. I don't want to fight you anymore.
What did you do?
Did the Council--?
Willow.
And sent you to bring Willow down.
God. I don't know where to start-
She has. She was - and I barely even noticed. Everything's been so... Dawn's a total klepto, Xander left Anya at the altar and Anya became a demon again. And I - I'm so... I've been sleeping with Spike.
Over their mouths! Then I'm letting the demon eat them-
All of it! You, Sunnydale... And I'm a nutcase in L.A.!
For what?
Oh, Giles... You were right to leave. We're just... stupid.
No. You were right about everything. It is time I was an adult.
Now you tell me.
It was my time, Giles. Someone would have taken my place. So why?
Help.
Giles! You're gonna kill her!
Don't.
Move!
We have to get out of here. Xander!
We can... pile up some of these... coffins. Give us some height to... Uhh!
That's the last place we need to be.
What he--?
Xander...
Dawn, we're in big trouble. Now's not the time to--
You didn't need to know.
I'm trying to protect you.
Dawn...
XANDER?
Jonathan and Andrew up there with you?
Xander, try to find a rope or something and get us out of here.
And hurry before--
Anya! What are you doing here? Where's Giles?
Did he stop Willow?
How worse?
Where's that?
There's no temple on Kingman's Bluff.
Who's she?
So, seventy years later, Willow's going to make their dreams come true.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
What do you-- Is he okay?
Xander? Where's that rope?
Xander! Where is he?
I heard. And I don't care... I have to try...
Willow?
By killing us?
Willow - what do you-
I can't take them. They just keep coming.
Willow...
Yeah, dummy... You think I wanted the world to end?
Dawn, I'm so sorry...
No. It hasn't been. It hasn't been okay...
You. Things have sucked lately, but it's all gonna change - and I want to be there when it does. I want to see my friends happy again. And I want to see you grow up. The woman you're going to become... Because she's going to be beautiful.
Willow. Listen to him. I don't want to fight you anymore.
What did you do?
Did the Council--?

I heard screaming.
And ... there was a girl.
No, it was ...
Vision, maybe.
"From beneath you, it devours." That's all she could say. And then they ... There's more like her, Dawn. Somewhere. Out there.
I hate tea.
"From beneath you ..."
Well, I'm glad for all of you then.
You've been very specific.
Three. Three days a week. I'm only doing this community counseling gig part time, so if you want to be embarrassed Tuesdays and Thursdays? You're on your own, Missy.
I doubt you'll see me at all, assuming I even half-understand my fuzzy job description ...
Huh? Oh, it's not the job of it, it's ... anyone else find it a little weird that Principal Wood just - hired me? Just like that?
Just seems, I don't know ... convenient.
You could be dating now.
All hard to resist.
Yeah, that one. That's not something you just bounce right back from.
That's where I go to get my scorn on...
Hello, you were the one having the Smooch-athon with teen-vampire last Halloween.
What if they don't? Should I panic?
Can I give detention?
You heard about Principal Flutie, right?
Forget it.
And for that, I thank you.
Right. I'll just ... come to you with questions when they come to me with questions.
Wooden rod they use to smack the soles of your feet in Turkish prisons, but if you use the right wood, it makes an awesome billy club.
Just one thing. I was curious, and don't think I'm not grateful or anything, but ... why is it exactly I ...
I still haven't finished college.
So was it my sparkling personality, or maybe you've just enjoyed my work at the Double Meat Palace ...
Nothing I can think of.
Thanks. I'm gonna look around, get to know the place... Make sure it's all...
Spike?
We've seen things too, Nancy.
"... From beneath you it devours."
Nothing.
Just us. Right.
We're going to get into this. And if your dog's alive, we'll find him. I promise. The only thing we need ...
Spike.
You've changed.
Nice clothes. Better hair. And not so much with the crazy, I like it.
You said something about "quick?"
Wait. Guys. Yes, I saw Spike ... I just ...
Things in that basement were insane. I saved your life. We'll discuss this later.
Guys. Give us a minute.
Then what the hell do you want?
Everything about you is wrong, Spike.
Since when did you become the champion of the people?
We're gonna split. Two pairs. Whatever this creature is, it's burrowing through solid ground. That means a kind of strength and power we don't usually deal with. But we may have to yet used to, now that the Hellmouth's getting all perky.
Xander. Take Nancy home. Drive, don't walk and try not to stop 'til you get there.
Spike and I'll check out the site of the attack.
And failed. I know I can take him.
Let's head out.
I wouldn't know what to say.
What are you doing?
How'd you guess.
But if something bites it off, that will be a clue.
Dunno. I guess ... I was partly hoping you were some kind of mirage.
Not your fault.
Spike, I can't. I can't do this. I can't ... I don't know what this is. I don't know what you want.
This isn't ... our working together's not going to get us back together. If that's what you want.
"Skittish?" That's not a word I'd use for it. You tried to rape me. I don't have the words.
I believe you.
I just don't know what you've changed into. You come back to town, you make with the big surprises - twice - and I don't know what your game is, Spike, but I know - there's something you're not telling me.
We noticed.
You wished your ex was a worm.
Anya, that thing you created burst through solid pavement and ate her dog.
Never serious.
Can we all just focus a minute? Anya. This Ronnie? He's not a worm. Worms are like, this big. They're fish bait. That thing ...
Spike. What's she talking about?
You haven't changed, Spike.
Not now, Xander.
I'll go find her. You work on Anya - get her to reverse that spell.
You're not the one who needs it. He's going into shock ...
Spike! Whatever you're doing ...
Do it somewhere else. I'm through with this.
Stay with him. Make sure he gets help.
So that's the problem.
Got news, Spike. You're not that nice.
Spike ...
You have a soul.
But why'd you do it ...?
I heard screaming.
And ... there was a girl.
No, it was ...

Here we go.
Uh, have we...
Oh, sure, sure...
Didn't see it.
Foot! Yes! Right. And history class, okay, it's coming back. I'm sorry.
But I just didn't recognize you 'cause you're, you know, a demon, and I think you've filled out a lot.
Well, that's great. So what have you been up to?
Wow, that's gotta be a... popular joint.
Oh, yeah...
How is he?
Ironic, sort of.
Yeah. You look human now. You can go back and forth.
I'm sorry.
Not so much connected.
Well, I'm the Slayer, it's sort of a thing...
Well, I don't get paid, it's more like a calling. Since... Even in school.
I was?
What?! I dated that ringworm!
Men , do I know how to pick 'em.
"The."
Pretty much.
Oh, psych 101 alert...
Yeah, what I really need right now is emotional therapy from the Evil Dead.
I'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, okay?
I mean I really am...
But they never last.
Well, my folks weren't paragons of stay-togetherness, and maybe that's a part of... but I think there's people out there who make it. I just seem to target the impossible ones. With deadly accuracy.
Protecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual violence and possible death, not so much.
I commit! I'm committed! I'm a committee .
No... I mean, it's different... You're confusing me 'cause you're evil.
Wouldn't it be cool if I did, though?
Sire.
The word. When you turn a human into a vampire. It's, you "sire" them.
It's a noun too.
Is that how you say the word?
That's the time-honored custom.
No, no, you've been great.
Yeah.
It's 'cause I'm gonna win.
You're not leaving this graveyard. I can't let you.
What, you think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You know I'm sworn to -
There's no issue. Don't issue me.
Okay, this is beyond evil. This is insane troll logic. What do my parents --
Well, they couldn't get along, they both had a lot of...
My dad.
He cheated. I'm pretty sure he cheated. I mean, Mom never said anything, and, God, Dawn has no idea, but I think he was...
No point. It was over.
It's incredibly different!
Say! There's that bloodlust I was looking for!
I'm gonna strike a nerve CLUSTER in a minute, you don't get off this. You know, I really don't remember you being this annoying.
Yes I do...
I'm not. God, if anything...
I'm really... if you knew what I've done, what I've let myself become...
The relationships, I know it's not their fault. I'm not really sure how they put up with me. The last guy I was with, it got really... I behaved like a monster. Treated him like... and at the same time I let him just take me over, do things to me that... if anyone knew what really went on between us, they'd never look at me again.
You don't know.
I couldn't...
You son of a bitch.
I think I'm gonna kill you just a little bit more than usual.
See? You're dead? That enough of a moment for you?
GNAARRRRGH!!!!
See, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death and pain and love, it's all, the same damn thing to you.
It's not the same. With vampires, it's completely... believe me, I know.
Oh your god what?
Nothing solid.
What's your question?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid of falling back into the way I was last year. I thought I was nothing. I have so much power, I didn't ask for it, I don't deserve it... sometimes I think... I think the relationship I had last year was... like I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I deserved to.
And the joke is, he loved me. In his own sick, soulless way, he really did care for me. But I didn't want to be loved.
I just wanted to be touched. To be reached. Were you here when everything turned into a musical?
I explained it a lot better then. With rhyme, and all, but I just... I can't go back to that.
Well, he's changed, a lot, a LOT a lot, but no, I... I just can't feel as low as I did then and do what I have to do. Things are getting worse. More of you guys are rising, and... something's coming.
I have to fight it and the truth is, I don't have any more answers than I did then. There's so many people to protect...
I have friends, they do it with me -- sometimes they do it in spite of me, but they do it 'cause they're decent people. I do it 'cause I was chosen.
I feel like I'm worse than anyone, honestly, I'm beneath them. My friends, my boyfriends, I feel like I'm not worthy of their love 'cause even though they love me it doesn't really mean anything because their opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've been through, they're not the Slayer... I am. And sometimes I feel... this is what's so awful. I feel like I'm better than them. Superior.
It doesn't make any sense.
I suppose. Thanks for listening.
You're not a stranger. But that stuff with Spike is pretty --
What?
What do you mean? You know Spike? How?
Sired.
Uh, have we...
Oh, sure, sure...
Didn't see it.

THANKS FOR NOTICING
WILL I STAY THIS WAY FOREVER SLEEPWALK THROUGH MY LIFE'S ENDEAVOR
-- WHATEVER I DON'T WANT TO BE GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS LOSING ALL MY DRIVE
What? Oh. I think so.
Then she probably took it when she probably got on the bus.
So, uh... no research? Nothing going on? Monsters, or whatnot?
Like you were in a musical?
You have monkey trouble?
I, uh... I don't remember. But it seemed perfectly normal.
I'VE GOT A THEORY IT DOESN'T MATTER
HEY, I'VE DIED TWICE
So what is it? What's causing it?
Well I'm not exactly quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots but there's definitely something unnatural going on. And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies.
It's not just us.
Everybody started singing and dancing?
Who now?
Xander...
No it's not.
So you know what's going on.
A world of no. You know anything about what's causing this?
What else would I want to pump you for? I really said that, didn't I?
What's up? You're all bad moody.
What.
Am I supposed to bow now, or... have honor or something?
You'll figure it out. I'm just worried this whole session is going to turn into a training montage from an eighties movie.
Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.
I thought you took care of that.
What would I do without you.
Did you say something?
So Dawn's in trouble. It must be Tuesday.
It's not your fault. Giles, what's the plan?
I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Isn't that what you sang?
You're really not coming.
What do you expect me to do?
I TOUCH THE FIRE AND IT FREEZES ME I LOOK INTO IT AND IT'S BLACK WHY CAN'T I FEEL MY SKIN SHOULD CRACK AND PEEL I WANT THE FIRE BACK
SO ONE BY ONE THEY TURN FROM ME I GUESS MY FRIENDS CAN'T FACE THE COLD
BUT WHY I FROZE NOT ONE AMONG THEM KNOWS AND NEVER CAN BE TOLD
THESE ENDLESS DAYS ARE FINALLY ENDING IN A BLAZE
How are you with death scenes?
Well, I aughta know what to call you if you're gonna be my brother in law.
Don't worry, you're not going anywhere. I am.
What do you want a little kid for? Deal's this: I can't kill you, you take me to hellsville in her place.
Trust me. It won't help.
That's life.
I think you already know... LIFE'S A SHOW AND WE ALL PLAY OUR PARTS AND WHEN THE MUSIC STARTS WE OPEN UP OUR HEARTS IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SOMETHING'S COME OUT WRONG WE'LL SING A HAPPY SONG
DON'T GIVE ME SONGS DON'T GIVE ME SONGS GIVE ME SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT I NEED SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT
Hey.
I don't want to...
Spike, I...
I TOUCH THE FIRE AND IT FREEZES ME I LOOK INTO IT AND IT'S BLACK THIS ISN'T REAL BUT I JUST WANT TO FEEL... SPIKE I DIED SO MANY YEARS AGO BUT YOU CAN MAKE ME FEEL...

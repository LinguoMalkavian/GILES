I'm really sorry.
No, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner. Someday. I hate having to run out in the middle, it's just this thing out there.
Spike says it's pretty scary, some kind of monster thing, definitely non-vampire.
Yeah, this might be a while, you shouldn't wait up. Besides, Willow promised she's on birthday patrol. Nothin' left for us to do.
Okay, so homework, finish dinner, and don't stay up too late, all right?
Good. We'll spend time later, I promise.
Hey, I was using that!
Is there a chemical leak in here?
Oh, God.
Is there, like, demon meat in there somewhere?
Gagggghhh.
No. Willow, Tara, you guys.. Oh, I invited Sophie from work.
Okay, shut up.
What new friend thing?
I'm going to assume this was an act of kindness. That will help me with all the not throttling.
Yes. Maybe we should.
I promise I'll let you know when it's time, hang out, have some punch.
Hey, you came.
Oh, you know. Better. Mostly. Sometimes.
He may be a chip head but he still doesn't play well with others. And I'm definitely not ready to...
Yeah. I'm all stay inny. How about you, are you okay?
Well, remember, we're all-
Hey, how did - -
Spike?
Wait, what kind of team is this?
Yes. Yes, we did.
Hey.
Oh? well, it's easy, you just --
Okay. Be right back.
Skin condition. Doesn't really talk about it.
Now? Here? Where? I don't think so.
Shut up, he's sweet.
Maybe he's not the jealous one.
Uh...
Uh huh.
Okay! Great, thanks, what's next?
Dawn...
It's gorgeous.
It's still got a security tag.
Oh my God.
A Xander Harris Original. It's beautiful, thank you.
Sophie, hey, we're somewhere between presents and cake. There... is going to be cake eventually, right?
No problem.
Well... yeah. All the good ones got picked off by that lady with the wig, lay off.
Dawnie, you mind getting the door? We can do official introductions now that everyone's officially here.
I hope so.
Yeah.
No, thanks, I'm -- I'm good. I'm gonna head back in.
Seriously, stop it, someone will see.
This sucks. I'm out.
No kittens! He's quirky.
Well... I don't know. I guess, as long as we're all staying up anyway.
Spike.
'Course, with that new diet of yours, you wanna be careful about what you try to put in your mouth now. Spikey.
Okey-dokey.
Hey! Passive Aggressive Guy! Seriously, wanna take it down a notch or two out there?
We do not joke about eating people in this house!
I should have thrown you out the second you got here. I was insane to think you could ever just hang out with my friends.
You know what? I think it's time for you to go.
Then I'll go.
Fine!
I'm actually trying to move now.
Well. This can't be good.
There's something keeping us in this house.
And, hence, the dilemma.
I know, I know, we all have places we'd rather be.
So the first priority has to be finding a way out of here.
Dawn?
Did you do something?
Listen, it's okay, Dawny. We're not gonna be mad - -
We just wanna try to figure out what's going on.
Dawn, if you want us to-
That'd be nice.
She was so angry. I've never seen her like that.
I know, but I can't figure out why she didn't just come to me.
Seems like our best bet is magic, something general, cast a wide net.
And we don't have any in the house. We got rid of everything.
Hey. It's gonna be okay. You have to trust me, I promise you we'll be out of here soon, okay?
I'm gonna go check upstairs. You keep an eye on things down here?
The sword. Grab the sword!
It's getting kind of scary, I know. You okay?
Fine. Stay with Spike.
I never said you did.
What did you want?
Dawn, come on
What are you talking about, I don't know what what's --
You're not alone.
I wish you had told me.
What? I haven't been what?
Dawn, the most important job I have is looking out for you.
Counselor?
And you'd never met her before?
And she got you to just start talking about things that bothered you at home.
You didn't, by any chance, express any kind of, like, wish or something to her, did you?
Anya, no, it wasn't her fault.
Anya. Hold on. Just tell her you didn't do this. Tell her it's a mistake.
Oh.
No. She didn't -- it wasn't Dawn. I think it was a guidance counselor. Or someone pretending to be one, She got Dawn to make a wish.
You guys know each other?
You think it's worn off?
I'm really sorry.

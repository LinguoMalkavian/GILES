Oh, great. A book.
Thanks, Dave. The Willow pile.
Willow! Willow! Hey, wait up!
Or hear me. What was up last night? I tried your line like a million times.
Talking to...
Okay, that's it. You have a secret and that is not allowed.
'Cause... there's a rule.
I knew it! This is so important. When did you meet?
Does he go here? What's his name? Have you kissed him? What's he like?
You are a thing of evil for not telling me this right away.
What's he look like?
You've been seeing a guy and you don't know what he looks like. Okay, it's a puzzle. No wait, I'm good at these. Does it involve a midget and a block of ice?
On line for what?
Oh. On line. As in -- right. Duhh.
I have a free.
Oh sure.
Uh, yeah, he's a sweetie.
Uh, Willow... I think it's great that you've got a cool pen pal, but... you seem to be kind of rushing all into this. You know what I mean?
Will. Down girl. Let's focus. What do you really know about this guy?
Like what? I just think you should be, well, careful.
He could be different than you think.
Short, tall, skinny, fat...
Not everything. But some stuff is. I mean, what if you guys get really intense and then you find out he... has a hairy back?
Hey. I just want to make sure he's good enough for you, that's all. I think it's great that you're --
What?
Okay, sorry...
Check out the jealous man.
You're jealous!
Willow's got a thang and Xander's left hanging.
Yeah, but you got used to being the belle of the ball.
Slightly. I mean, just not knowing what he's really like.
You are.
I get your point. I get your point. This guy could be anything. Old, weird, crazy... he could be a circus freak!
Willow axe-murdered by a circus freak. What do we do?
What are we doing? Xander, you get me started... we're totally over-reacting.
Whoah, you're the late girl.
Till fifth period? Talking to Malcolm last night?
Nothing.
I'm not. But if I was, it would be saying... It's just not like you.
He's... boyfriendly?
I thought you overslept.
Malcolm was right.
Hi Dave.
Hey there Dave.
Anybody home?
I wanted to ask you something. If you had a minute...
Well, you're a computer geek --nius... I have a technical problem. If I wanted to find out something about someone, if someone E-mailed me, could I trace the letter?
But they write the profile themselves, right? So they could say anything they want.
Wow, I had knowledge.
Well, is there a way to find out exactly where a letter -- an E-letter -- came from? I mean the actual location of the computer?
'Cause Willow's got this friend Malcolm and it's like he's --
What do you mean?
Dave... are you Malcolm?
Your hands...
What's going on?
So do I.
There's something going on. It's not just Willow; Dave and Fritz, they're all wicked jumpy.
Giles, trust me.
And our resident computer expert is too wrapped up in her new cyber-beau to help out. I gotta figure this out.
Follow Dave? What, in a trench coat and dark glasses? Please. I'll work this out. Willow's been acting weird since we scanned those books. Fritz has been acting weird since birth... I don't know. I've got all the pieces but no puzzle. Or, I've got puzzle pieces but some of them are missing. Or they're in the wrong place in the puzzle... I hate metaphors. I'm gonna follow Dave.
Said CRD. I couldn't get close enough to see what it was --
But it closed.
Besides, I can just tell something's wrong. My spider-sense is tingling.
Pop-culture reference.
Breaking in. This then is the plan.
Tonight it is.
We're literary.
Well, we gotta go.
No, I think we're done. Our speaking English good?
Dave. How're you doing?
Don't sweat it.
Oh, great, I wanted to catch her before she went home. Do you know where she is?
Great. Thanks.
Willow?
Will? You taking a shower?
Guess not.
This is how droughts are started.
He tried to warn me.
Tell me the truth. How's my hair?
I just don't understand what would make Dave do a thing like that.
Yeah, sure. It looks like a book.
Things.
Here we go...
Oh, way to go.
So a powerful demon with horns is walking around Sunnydale? And nobody's noticing?
Where was it?
Willow scanned all the new books.
No... he's not out here. He's in there.
He's gone binary on us.
And in every computer connected to it by a modem.
Put him back in the book?
Solid.
So, which file is it? Willow. That'd probably be the one. I'll just delete the whole thing.
"Stay away." That's just what Dave said when I asked about Willow and... Malcolm...
I'm wishing Willow's new boyfriend was just an axe-murdering circus freak.
Okay, so much for "delete file".
You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me? I don't know... mess up all the medical equipment in the world...
Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles...
I think I pretty much capped it with the nuclear missile thing.
The first thing we do is find Willow. She's probably talking to him right now. God, that creeps me out.
Let's never find out. I'm gonna check the computer lab. You call her house.
Willow?
Dave...
Dave. He's dead.
Well, it looked like suicide.
I'd guess Fritz. Or one of the zomboids from CRD.
We're going to Willow's house. (to Giles) You have to find a way to get Moloch out of the net.
Then get Ms. Calendar. Maybe she can help you.
Okay, stay here and come up with a better plan. (to Xander) Come on.
Willow!
The research place?
I guess it's our best lead. Let's just hope Giles can back us up.
Yeah.
Not at home. It looks like she was taken somewhere.
CRD. Whatever Moloch wants Willow for, it's probably in there.
Here's a tip: Hurry.
With jumping, sneaking, and the breaking of heads.
I just hope Willow's still okay.
Back way.
It's her!
I can't bust this. This is heavy steel.
The building's security system is computerized.
Ow! Guy's made of metal.
Wait --
Ahhh!
Take your best shot.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Get down!
It'll be fun.
Malcolm?
It doesn't say anything about you.
Hey. Did you forget? The one boy I've had the hots for here turned out to be a vampire.
Let's face it. None of us is ever going to have a normal, happy relationship.
Thanks, Dave. The Willow pile.

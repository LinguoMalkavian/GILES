Try picking on somebody my own size.
Her's me.
Right. Well... You are. I mean, you will be. Safer. With me around.
Welcome to the Hellmouth.
Oh. You're all still up.
Everybody, this is Rona.
She had a welcoming committee.
Squat's not gonna cut it. What about the Turok-Han?
Time might've forgotten, but I sure as hell won't. Stakes don't kill it. Anything in the ancient myths about what does? Sunlight? Fire? Germs?
It's not... You don't know-- It's more complicated than that, Chloe.
We're working on it.
What's a Botoxa's eye?
Fun.
I'll take anything I can get. Anya. Please. We're running out of time. Spike's running out of time.
Okay, listen up, Andrew. I don't exactly know what to do with you just yet. Except that we don't have time to babysit a hostage.
But I'm here to tell you... If you try anything or try to run, I'll... Did you see the movie "Misery?"
Okay. Still a couple of hours of daylight left. You guys should be safe. I'll go get her.
Clerk said this is the only check-in they've had in a week. Tourism must be down.
Hello...?
She's cold. Been dead for days.
I said, get away from them. Now!
Eve's dead.
Shut up and get out.
It's safer in than out.
Hey!
Don't help me.
Will... Sorry, but I gotta ask...
A major one. Something tells me this vamp doesn't need an invite to get in the house. Can you do it?
We don't have a lot of choices, Xander.
Then we'll deal with it.
They don't want in. They're here to make sure we don't get out.
Know how to use that?
Here it comes.
Willow--?
Will?
Hang on, Will.
Run. Everybody! Run!
C'mon.
Right behind us. Time to split up.
You take the others... find a safe location.
Try to slow the Turok down. Lead him away from you guys. Get him to chase me.
No --
Willow, you and Xander, get everybody out of here... Now!
Think you've won, don't you? Got us trapped... Now you're all pumped up, ready for the slaughter. You and your boss, The First.
See...
Her's me.

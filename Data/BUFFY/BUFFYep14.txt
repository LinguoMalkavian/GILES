Come on, Stephan, rise and shine. Some of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
Ack!
Are you crazy? You don't just sneak up on people in a graveyard. You make noise when you walk. You... stomp, or... yodel.
Supposed to be. But lazybones here doesn't wanna come out and play.
It's weird to think of you going through that.
Yeah, why?
Xander?
No, no Xander. Why, are you jealous?
Is it 'cause I danced with him?
Oh, you're shocking! One little dance and you know I just did it to make you crazy which by the way behold my success!
Oh, you're not jealous. What, vampires don't get jealous?
I didn't come here to fight.
And what do you mean, "He's just a kid." Does that mean I'm just a kid too?
Oh, no you don't. You can't just turn and walk away. It takes more then that to get rid of me...
I wish people wouldn't leave open graves laying around like this.
I don't think so. Whoever was buried here didn't rise from this grave...
Boy. I guess we just never realized how much you liked that chair.
Your pick-up lines?
Then, if you don't mind a little Gene and Roger, I would leave off the "idiot" part. Being called an idiot tends to take a person out of the dating mood.
I fear you. I'd also avoid words like "amenable" and "indecorous." Speak English, not whatever they speak in...
Yeah. Just say, "Hey, I got a thing, you're maybe feeling a thing, and there could be a thing."
I'm not finished. Then you say, "How do you feel about Mexican?"
Mexican! Food. You take her for food. For which you then pay.
And she's the only woman we've ever actually seen speaking to you. Add it all up, it spells "duh."
More or less. Angel and I took care of him.
There's something else, though. I found an empty grave.
No, no. It was dug up, and the body was taken out.
I know that you meant to say "gross and disturbing".
Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?
Coming through. Hey, Willow, sorry to interrupt, but.. it's the Bat Signal.
And how was her neck?
You know what this means...
It means she wasn't killed by vampires. So somebody did dig up her corpse.
So we should see if the other girls from this accident are AWOL, too. Might help figure out what this creep has in mind if we know whether he's dealing in volume.
I don't think so.
We've been sort of... never mind. As far as Angel knows, I'm taking the night off. Okay?
He was getting all jealous and he wouldn't even admit it.
Of Xander.
Am I ever gonna live that down?
Anyway, Angel's being totally irrational.
That's the truth.
Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned girl. I was raised to believe the men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies. Speaking of the wacky, what was Cordelia's whole riff about painful memories? Who's Daryl?
Was he a studly?
And he broke Cordy's heart? Thus possibly proving its existence...
Oh, man. That's lousy. Poor Chris.
Well, "body" could mean flesh eating demon or corpse-mutilating pagan ritual. "No body" points more toward the army of zombies thing. Take your pick.
Pathetic much?
Well, Zombie drill team then --
Angel...?
I was... going to. But, at the last minute- -
We were investigating... somebody's been stealing the bodies of dead girls.
You mean like two of the three?
I don't get it. Why dig up three bodies, just to chop them up and throw them away again?
Could this get yuckier?
Question answered.
Maybe whoever did it had other business in the neighborhood. Like, say... classes.
Why don't you get their locker numbers, and we'll check 'em out.
Okay, your butt's covered. You want to grab a locker?
Okay, Eric, let's see what's on your mind.
Yes we do.
Not yet.
Love has nothing to do with this.
Eric's sick enough to do something like this, but what's up with Chris? He seems like a human person.
But, it's not... doable, is it? I mean, making someone from scraps? Actually making them live?
Hey, Giles
Still no sign of our mad doctors.
Okay, Giles, just remember. "I'm feeling a thing, you're feeling a thing." But personalize it.
She's a techno-pagan, right? Ask her to bless your laptop or something. Come on, guys.
Well, it's official. Chris and Eric didn't come to school today.
God, what if it worked, what if that poor girl is walking around...
What could she be thinking?
And they only had three girls.
How fresh?
I think anyone who cuts dead girls into pieces does not get the benefit of any doubt. Let's end this thing.
You two head to Eric's. I'll try Chris's. We can meet back here.
You go ahead. We can handle this.
Okay, we'll meet up there. Report back.
No. He's just a ghoul.
So... is Chris home?
Yea, that was a great one... but is Chris home?
Cordelia...
Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia?
I'm sorry... where, did you say?
It's okay, you're okay. He's gone.
He's gone. What happened?
Well, it's okay now. You're fine. Just relax, take your time...
You sure you're okay to go out there?
I know what you're trying to do, Chris... you and Eric...
Who, Eric? He needs industrial strength therapy.
Who are you --
Daryl...? Daryl!
He's gonna pick up where you left off.
I don't see her. Do you?
He was here. Chris, where did he take her?
Where is that?
He'll kill Cordelia. You can't just give and take lives like that. It's not your job.
Okay, find Willow and Xander and Mr. Giles. Tell them what's going on.
Daryl, listen, I know who you are. Your brother sent me to stop this.
It's okay, Cordelia, I'm getting you out of here.
Get Cordelia!
Yeah. We're okay.
The whole thing was creepy. But at the same time... I mean, he did do it all for his brother...
Love makes you do the wacky...
Crazy stuff.
Are you fessing up?
I don't love Xander.
...yeah. I've got things to...
Come on, Stephan, rise and shine. Some of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.

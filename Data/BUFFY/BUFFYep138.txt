I told you, I don't want you doing that. It's distracting.
Are you still filming me? Stop filming me!
Oh for God's sake.
Come on, no one else thinks this is idiotic? We're the Army of the Slayer, not the Army of the Slayer Film School.
Someone must agree with me on this. Spike?
This is not about keeping busy! This is about WAR!
...more than just a battle. It's going to be a battle like we've never seen before.
Not late. Not late 'til the bell rings...
Yes. I did, it's okay, I--
I heard you. I can help. Someone give this boy a foot massage, okay?
Turn in the paper late. Skip the test. I'll say you're sick. Just don't explode.
And yet. Really. Take it easy. Foot-rub good.
Something bad's going on.
Things are, sort of, coming true. Like, all the hidden feelings of high school. You know, like, I'm fat or everyone's looking at me, or no one's looking at me...
I've been at this school a lot longer than you have. I've seen it before, just never all at once. Someone feels something in here and before you know it, stuff is happening and death is popping out all over.
It's starting small, but unless we do something, you're gonna have a riot.
Yeah. Because the students feel like the teachers are out to get them. And the chess club resents the French club for taking the activities room. And everybody hates the cheerleaders. Being in high school can feel like being at war... and now it's true.
I hate to say it. But I think that was the sound of an exploding freshman.
This is crazy.
I mean, we can't handle this by, like, beating up one insane student at a time. We have to get to the source of it.
The seal of Danthalzar.
Okay.
I swear we just covered this up.
It wants to do more than that. Listen, Robin. I had a... there was a kind of... vision that I had recently.
Sometimes.
If you're, like, running to catch the bus naked, it's a dream. Army of vicious vampire creatures, that's a vision. Also, I was awake.
Hundreds. Maybe hundreds of hundreds.
I know it's a goat's head with its tongue out. Willow did a search for that in the symbology data bases. Turns out everyone loves goat's tongue... covens and rock groups and Greek cookbooks. She said she couldn't narrow it down.
What? Why wouldn't I trust her?
No. What? That's not true. Willow had a... a... bad patch. But I haven't been--
Robin! Are you okay?
You were... I think it was controlling you.
What's that noise?
Put down the camera, Andrew. You're not just watching anymore. You're right in the middle of this.
No Zima!
Andrew. Stop it or I smash that camera over your head. Actually, I'm gonna do that either way. You're in this. So talk.
Dawn, search his stuff. Find the knife.
Andrew, can you speak this Tawarick?
You're coming with us to the Seal.
This Seal already almost caused a riot, and it only took it a day to do it. In a week it'll drive the whole town insane. We've got to do something right now.
Sounds good to me.
Well, it's better than nothing and we're desperate. Everyone get ready to go.
Remember that riot that almost happened today?
Um... what?
We are of the marching band.
I can hear them. Are they in the classrooms?
Robin!
Spike! Don't kill them! They're just kids!
Spike. Wood. I need you to stay here. Keep the way clear for our retreat.
Stop it!
No more.
What I do is too important to take the time to show it to the world.
Be quiet, Andrew. I don't want a biographer. Especially a murderer.
What? You stabbed Jonathan to death! What were you trying to do, scratch his back from the front?
I saw the Seal possess Robin-- Principal Wood earlier. That's what I thought you were going to say.
You just completely changed your story!
You did so!
So now I know where little Bringers come from.
Stay back.
It's your turn, Andrew.
Or we do this.
Does it really make sense? Bringing you here to talk to it? This thing doesn't understand words. It understands blood.
Well, we looked into that. Seems the blood of the man that awoke it... you... that's a different kind of deal. Reverses the whole thing.
I don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.
Stop that! Stop telling stories! Life is not a story!
Shut up. You always do that, make everything into a story so no one's responsible for anything because it's just like, following some script. Life isn't a story. Life is a bunch of stuff that we choose to do. You're not a tragic hero. You're a guy who killed his friend. And I'm not some--I don't know half as much as you think I do. I'm making it up. And I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we can all come through this thing if we work together, because we can't . People are going to die. Girls. Maybe me. Probably you. Probably right now.
When a river of your blood pours out, Andrew, it might save the world. What do you think of that? Does it make you a world-saver? Does it buy it all back? Are you a hero redeemed?
It didn't want your blood. It wanted your tears.
That's okay. I'm sorry I had to...
I just told you, I usually don't know as much as you think I do.
Are you still filming me? Stop filming me!
Oh for God's sake.
Come on, no one else thinks this is idiotic? We're the Army of the Slayer, not the Army of the Slayer Film School.

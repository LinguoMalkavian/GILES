Oh. You weren't really speaking to me, were you? My bad. Well, as long as I'm here...
No!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yeah, way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.
More often?
That's what you get for attacking a human.
Yes, 'cause muggers deserve to be eaten. You're just gonna have to get your rocks off fighting demons, Spike.
And to that an extreme see-ya-later
Spike. It's late. Can we finish this another time?
I'm not kissing you. Once was--
But not again.
You need any more metaphors for that li'l mix?
Willow?
Hey. How you doing?
Yeah?
Will. Can I talk to you about something?
Right. Okay, you know how we all make choices, and sometimes, they're the really good kind, and sometimes they're ...less good?
Hi.
Dead.
Well, I should let you guys catch up, I'll just --
What kind?
Yeah, kitchen. You want me to--
Okay, well, at least let me make up the couch. It's late, you should stay here. Everyone does.
Wow.
Is she gonna be --
Wow.
Huh? Oh -nothing. I mean, the whole Amy-Rat-Amy thing? No way I'm topping that.
How you doin', you need anything?
Thanks.
No kidding.
Oh! Gatorade has a new flavor. Blue.
If I could just -- I need to --
What are you doing here?
And I'm supposed to believe you just happen to be on the case?
Yeah, that never really seems to end well, does it?
You seem awfully fixated on a couple of kisses, Spike.
It didn't mean anything!
When I kissed you? You know I was thinking about Giles, right?
Wha ...? Oh. Eew. Spike. Gaah! He left, I was depressed, ergo vulnerability and bad kissing decisions. You need to let it go, because that's all it was, okay?
What?
Please. Stop.
You're not a man. You're a thing.
You're just a thing. An evil, disgusting thing. All right?
Anya?
So what do we do? Call him? It's the middle of last night there. Or maybe tomorrow. Does anyone remember how that works?
Magic? I don't think we need to resort to --
That's great, Will. Haven't seen you do that in a long time...
Is it a supernatural diamond? Like, all good-lucky? Or healing powers?
Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
Well maybe he doesn't eat diamonds. Maybe he just... thinks they're pretty.
Out with Amy, I guess.
But... she's not cooped up and crying, that's forward momentum. I don't know everything that happened with Tara, but Willow was --
I know. But I think she'll be fine. This is Willow, she of the level head
Right. Cause they might go all crazy and start alphabetizing everything.
That's not true-
Okay. We'll keep an eye. But we don't have to assume everybody's getting seduced. Sometimes--
Spike?
Spike?
You're calling me on the phone?
Why, are you helping again? You have a lead on the Frost Monster thingie?
What? No! No grunting.
Nothing. He wanted to... patrol. (so awkward it sounds like she doesn't speak English very well) But I told him that I would not.
I'm telling you, I think there's just something about this thing.
I'm just saying. All the things that've happened lately, a bank robbery, a jewel heist.
They just... is it me, or do they all seem really --
I was going for unusual, but yeah.
And so my night is now complete.
Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.
Why, what are you gonna do, walk behind me to death?
Enough! Enough, move.
How?
It's a trick. You did something to the chip, it's a trick.
See? Yes it does.
Me? I'm lost? Look at you, you idiot. Poor Spikey. Can't be a human, can't be a vampire. Where the hell do you fit in?
You're in love with pain. Admit it. You like me because you enjoy getting beat down. So who's really screwed up?
You haven't come close to hurting me.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yeah, way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.

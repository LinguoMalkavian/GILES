Sorry.
Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how. Look, I know it's my job and not yours--
No big. I'm kinda stressed myself.
There's Willow, there's the looming humongo bad, and.. it's a school night. I should be home in bed, cuddling up to my insomnia and worrying how I'm going to mess up tomorrow.
But this week is going to be my first time really talking to kids. What if their problems are all weird and tricky? What if I can't help them?
Yeah, right. Check out perfect me taking my sister on a fun, educational outing to the--
The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
That I can help with.
Come in!
Do you know why?
But this is a new school. Everyone here is new.
It's not stupid. It's like the teacher's lounge for me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do in there. I mean, lounge of course, but it's weird. I feel awkward, just like you do.
Okay. That's fine.
Okay.
I'm sorry Amanda.
It's awful being teased. But the thing is, bullies like that? They're just--
Nothing so drastic. Just tomorrow at lunch, you look for someone who's sitting alone. And you sit down next to them.
You could picture them in their underwear, but it might ruin your appetite.
You've got to stick up for yourself. Let this bully know that you won't take any sh--guff, from him. Any guff.
Well, it's true.
You, what ?
So, what's on your mind?
Are you worried about school, friends, girls, your parents--
What about them?
Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.
Yeah.
He sounds like he's pretty tough, your brother.
You're not messed up. It's not messed up to worry about your brother.
Have you talked to your brother? Told him how you feel?
Okay.
So, Josh, what's on your mind?
Okay, first of all, I think it's great that you would talk to me about this. And you should know there's nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.
It sounds like it's difficult for you. Like maybe your sister makes it hard for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, and that she doesn't let you make your own decisions--
I understand. That must be hard.
So you're not doing your homework.
I know high school can be frustrating. But if you just get through it, then you can go to college or join the French Foreign Legion or anything you want.
Okay, so no French Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean, all the changing your name and being indentured for years and occupying Algeria.
Why not?
Don't change the subject, Cassie why wouldn't you graduate?
What?
No. We have to talk about this.
Cassie, what makes you feel like this?
Like you want to... hurt yourself.
Okay. Then, what, what are you saying?
No, you're not. This is why I'm here. Tell me why you think you're going to die.
What do you mean, you know? Are you saying you know someone wants to hurt you? Has someone threatened you?
Coins?
What do you mean, underground?
Cassie, I don't understand what you're--
I--
Cassie, wait--
What am I supposed to do?
And?
The hood?
But sometimes, sometimes it's not just talk, right?
So what do we do? How do we help her?
It's not enough. I want to, I don't know what. I need to do something. I need to make this better.
I have a job for you.
Cassie's records all show the same story - Good grades, good kid. Then suddenly, not so good grades, absenteeism, comments about apathy and depression.
Right. If she did have some kind of psychic vision, that would explain it. I mean, it's hard to do homework if you think you're about to die.
I don't know. Maybe. I told you how she--
Maybe. But, maybe not.
Her doctor already sent them.
We got zip. And we're running out of days.
Wow. Lotta poems here.
That's her dad. Open that.
The one who asked her to the dance?
Her dad's a drunk.
We better find out. Here's his address. Xand, you got your keys?
Buffy the Vampire Slayer would just kick down this door.
Waits.
I work at your daughter's school. I need to talk to you.
She's having some problems. But it's kind of you I want to talk about.
I know you got picked up by the police a couple times. Are you still drinking a lot?
Xander. Mr. Newton, I don't know exactly how to ask this...
Frankly, we're worried that you might drink too much and hurt Cassie.
We just want to make sure--
Which is when?
Which weekend is it?
Will you see her this Friday?
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah, we will.
Shouldn't it be a comfort?
Then fight. Try.
See, that doesn't sound like someone who really wants to live.
Cassie, no. You will. You will. You just have to tell us what you know. Everything about this... Please, please, help us.
Oh!
It's okay. I just didn't sleep much.
I sit alone at my window sill/ Trees Crackle/ sunshine blares...
Spike! What are you doing?
I've got to ask you something.
Spike, there's a girl. She's in danger and I need your help. Now.
Do you know anything? Spike? Is there something, something evil, in the school... down here maybe? Do you know anything?
Spike! Stop it! What did you do?
Spike. No. Not me.
No, I'm not... I think it's worse when I'm here.
You look kinda upset. Something on your mind?
Do you get pissed off a lot?
Let me cut to the chase here, alright? I hear you can't get a date to the Winter Formal.
Crazy?
Dawn is my sister, That's right.
You wouldn't be mad at Cassie? With her rejecting you like that?
You're asking my sister to the prom? And she's your second choice?
You have locker number 174?
I want you to tell me what this is, and what it has to do with a girl called Cassie Newton.
I know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around. You need to talk to me. Now.
You know why I came back here to Sunnydale High?
To help. I'm a counselor here because I want to help. I know what it's like to walk these halls and feel lost. Alone... All I want to do is make things better. Connect. And I'm gonna connect with your face if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.
Okay, that is going on your permanent record.
Okay, do you know how lame this is?
No!
Spike!
You untie her. I'll take...
Are you okay?
Sorry, my office hours are ten to four.
It's all okay now.
Cassie! Cassie!
Okay. As okay as... she said their family had a history of heart irregularities... but that she never told Cassie. Cassie didn't know that she had, a hole, a hole in her heart.
She just knew. She was... special. And I failed her.
And I couldn't, I didn't. It's... there're all these kids, you know, and they hurt so bad. I almost forgot, somehow, I almost forgot how much high school hurts.
Oh, Dawnie, I'm so sorry. I failed for you too.
So then what? What do you do when you know that? What do you do when you know maybe you can't help?
Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how. Look, I know it's my job and not yours--
No big. I'm kinda stressed myself.

Hmm?
Oh.
I'm sorry. I was just . . . thinking about . . . things. And stuff.
Not exactly. For us to have a conversation about a guy there would have to be a guy for us to have a conversation about. Was that a sentence?
I do. Which is fine, most of the time, but . . .
Angel. Yeah, I can see him in a relationship. "Hi honey, you're in grave danger, see you next month."
He disappears! Every time. Tells me there's trouble then poof. Gone. But when he's around . . . It's like the lights dim everywhere else. You know how that happens with some guys?
All right, now I'm infecting those near and dear to me. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Raincheck. Night.
It's late, I'm tired, I don't want to play games. Show yourself.
You really should talk to your orthodontist about a refund.
Hey, ow, okay, I'm letting go. I don't want to fight all three of you . . .
. . . unless I have to.
Look out!
Run!
Get in! Come on!
I heard that, but I never put it to the test before.
I'll get some bandages, take your jacket and shirt off.
Nice tattoo.
I was lucky you came along. How did you happen to come along anyway?
So you weren't following me? I had this feeling you were . . .
You tell me, you're the Mystery Guy who appears out of nowhere -- I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight -- but if you are hanging around me I'd like to know why.
"Maybe"?
There's a lot of weird people out at night, I just feel better with you safe and sound inside. (closes and locks door) You must be beat.
Why don't you go upstairs, get in bed, I'll make you some hot tea --
What do you mean? I didn't do anything -- I'm concerned about your needs, can't a daughter --
Oh. Mom, this is Angel, Angel this is my mom. I just happened to . . . run into him on my way home.
He's a student. First year community college. Angel's been helping me with my history. You know I've been toiling there.
I'll say goodnight and do the same.
Good night, we'll hook up soon and do the study thing.
And I don't want to get you dead -- they could still be out there. So, one bed, two of us -- that doesn't work -- you're wounded, you take ANGEL I'll take the floor. (she gives him a look) Believe me, I've had worse.
Why don't you see if the Fang Gang is loitering and keep your back turned while I change.
You know, I'm the Chosen One. It's my job to fight guys like that. What's your excuse?
Well, what does your family think of your career choice?
Was it vampires?
I'm sorry.
So this is a vengeance gig for you?
Well, when I wake up it's a whole different story. Sleep tight.
Angel?
Do you snore?
Not in my bed, by my bed.
Perfect gentleman.
Saving my life, getting slashed in the ribs?
Yeah, what's with the uniforms?
And look at these babies, goodbye stakes, hello flying fatality. What can I shoot?
Giles, twentieth century, I'm not gonna be fighting Fryer Tuck.
I'm not gonna need pads for you.
I bet they'll go away in a day or so -- are those new curtains?
What am I thinking? I know what I'm thinking, more protein. Your chicken rocks, Mom.
Soon . . .
Okay, so slower than you and Dad took it.
You were young, you were in love, what you weren't was through with college, focused on a career and . . . no help from the audience, please, in possession of your own identity.
Angel?
Don't do that. Brought you some dinner. (holds up baggie) It's a little plateless, what'd you do all day, anyway?
-- my diary? You read my diary?
-- That is not okay, a diary is a person's most private place and you don't even know what I was writing about, "Hunk" can mean a lot of things, bad things, and where it says your eyes are "penetrating" I meant to write "bulgy".
And for your information "A" does not stand for Angel, it stands for . . . Achmed, a charming foreign exchange student and so that whole fantasy part has nothing to do with --
Oh. Ohhhhh.
Hey, no big. Water over the bridge --
-- it's under the bridge, over the dam, kiss me?
. . . how much older?
Go, you said.
Nothing . . . I saw a shadow.
I can't believe this is happening . . . one minute we're kissing, the next minute . . . . . . can a vampire ever been a good person? Couldn't it happen?
Well then what was he doing? Why was he . . . good to me? Was it all some part of the Master's plan? It doesn't make sense .
And we think we have problems.
They got that right.
A bird or something.
Two hundred and forty. Well, he did say he was older.
He could have fed on me, he didn't.
Huh? Reconstruction? It began after the, ah, construction which was shoddy and so they had to reconstruct --
Right. The Civil War, during which Angel was already like a hundred and change.
You want Xander to . . . you got to speak up, girl.
Unbelievable.
No, speak up. I've got to get over him so I can . . .
Like Xander said, I'm a Slayer, he's a vampire. Oh god, I can't. He's never done anything to hurt me. I gotta stop thinking about this. Give me another half hour, maybe something will sink in. Then I'm going home for some major moping.
. . . I'm home.
You're not welcome here. Come near us and I'll kill you.
Mom, mom can you hear me?
I need an ambulance, sixteen-thirty Revello Drive. My mother . . . cut herself, she's lost a lot of blood . . . please hurry --
Angel.
Do you remember anything, mom?
My friend . . .
Mom, this is Mr. Giles.
Mom, get some rest now.
The doctor says she's going to be okay. They gave her some iron, her blood count's a little . . .
Lucky and oh-so-stupid.
Oh no? I invited him into my home. And even after I knew who he was -- what he was -- I didn't do anything about it. Because I had feelings , because I cared about him .
Killing them? Maybe not, but it's a start.
Thanks. The Three found me near the Bronze and so did he. He lives nearby . . .
So do I.
I know you're there . . .
And I finally know what you are.
You're not an animal. Animals I like.
Why? Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? Was it just a joke? To make me feel for you and then . . . I've killed a lot of vampires. I've never hated one before.
You play me like a fool. Come into my home. And then you attack my family . . .
A hundred years.
Her clan?
What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?
So you start with my mom? Am I supposed to feel honored?
Then why didn't you say something --
Then go ahead.
Not as easy as it looks.
Bad hair on top of that outfit?
So you guys were . . . involved.
Well you're going to pile up a few ex's when you've been around since Columbus. You are older than him, right? One gal to another, you look a little worn around the eyes.
I know I didn't.
Angel!
Here Mom, you gotta eat this. It's what the doctor said, to build up your iron. How are you feeling?
Good. I was so worried about you, I mean it actually made me feel sick. If anything happened to you . . .
I guess I do. Ouch, and now I am so sorry for about a kazillion things I've put you through.
Now eat your vegetables.
Mom . . .
What's the difference between this and the pre-fumigation party?
No. I don't think he'll be around. It's weird, though. In a way I feel like he's still watching me.
We're both good. You?
I know, ever be anything. For one thing you're like two hundred and twenty-four years older than I am.
I know. Me, too.
One of us has to go here.
Are you okay?
Painful, I know . . . I'll see you around.
Hmm?
Oh.
I'm sorry. I was just . . . thinking about . . . things. And stuff.

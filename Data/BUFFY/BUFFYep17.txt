She’s singing.
Her lover? I thought he was her chiropractor.
I for one am giddy and up. There’s a kind of hush all over Sunnydale, no vampires or demons to slay, I’m here with my friends and— -- where does the water buffalo fit in again?
Third night in a row.
Stuff.
It had surround sound. I’m just thinking about him so much lately.
Vampire thing?
I’m brainsick, I can’t have a relationship with him.
Nothing I have. Coffee.
Oops, I told Giles I’d met him in the Library ten minutes ago – -- there hasn’t been much paranormal activity lately, he won’t be upset.
I haven’t let my guard down.
And the little scrap of my life that still belongs to me – say from seven to seven oh five in the morning – can I do what I want to then?
No, I think you don’t know what it’s like to be sixteen and a girl and a Slayer.
Or what it’s like to exterminate vampires while you’re having fuzzy feelings towards one.
Yeah, digging on the undead doesn’t exactly bolster your social life.
Can’t have a social life anyway, too busy killing fiends from hell?
We talkin’ foreign or domestic – how ‘bout none .
I’m dawdling. With my friends.
Dawdle, dawdle, dawdle… I’m a rebel and I’ll never ever be any good…
I don’t really want to meet any fraternity –
So not interested.
I’m Buffy Summers.
Junior.
History stumps me. I have a hard enough time remembering what happened last week.
I wish I could but… I’m sort of seeing someone.
People underestimate the value of a good ramble.
I gotta… nice to meet you
Please don’t.
Oh… hi. Nice to… blood?
It’s pretty thin, probably belonged to a girl.
I was just mulling, wouldn’t it be funny to see each other some time when it wasn’t a blood thing?
No –
Who said date? I never said date.
Coffee?
Really? And what do you think is happening?
I’ve done the math.
Oh I think I do: I want out of this conversation.
Then… whatever, I don’t know, might be nice to find out. But you want to end it before it’s begun. Fine.
No. When you kiss me I want to die.
I’ll go.
Angel.
I’m not going with Angel. I’m going with… ye gods, Cordelia.
Nothing. As usual. A whole lot of nothing with Angel.
The guy hardly ever says two words to me…
… and he treats me like a child.
At least Tom can carry on a conversation.
I found this.
It’s broken in two, I don’t know what the other letters might have spelled… and there’s blood on it.
Angel showed up. Said he could smell it.
Hello, “she’s” standing right here. And she’s not available tonight.
--I’ve got a mountain of homework, my mom’s sick and she needs me to take care of her, and I’m starting to feel a little woozy myself.
I’ll make a quick pass early this evening, and another one later on, but for the bulk of the evening…
Well, say it.
I wasn’t lying. I was protecting him. From information he wouldn’t be able to… digest properly.
There’s no orgy.
Look, six days a week I’m busy saving the world. Once in a great while I want to have some fun. And that’s what I’m going to have tonight… fun.
What weird…?
You guys want to…
I don’t know… maybe it isn’t such a good idea—
Is there alcohol in this?
I’ll just…
Thanks for…
No. It’s just… I shouldn’t be here.
No.
Someone’s not seeing me.
I have obligations, people I’m responsible to… or for… or with, it’s complex.
He might come back.
Yeah. I was just… thinking.
Ahhh, what the hell.
Tom?
Okay. Just need to stop spinning for a…
In the basement, far as I can tell.
They drugged us.
I don’t know…
Tom.
Three stones… three of us.
Stay calm. We’ll get out of this.
A psycho-cult.
I don’t think so.
I don’t think we go to it, I think it comes to us …
Hey, Reptile Boy!
You don’t want her. She’s all skin and bones. Half hour later you’ll be hungry again. Why don’t you try me –
Tom…
Back off, wormy!
I told one lie, I had one drink…
Sorry, Giles.
Angel.
Yeah.

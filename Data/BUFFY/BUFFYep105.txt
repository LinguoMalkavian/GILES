Hello!
Yep. Me. And I picked up dinner. Deep fried chicken parts.
Hope everyone's hungr--
S'okay. More for me.
What, so?
Intense.
I don't. It's...not important. It's past. So I'll just keep this one to myself, if that's okay.
Oh, yeah. Thought a lot about that. And I'm pretty sure I figured out what it is I should be doing.
Yeah. Got it all wired. I'll hold off paying the plumber right away, use the money to pay the utility bills, that way I can wait to re- shingle the roof until--
Oh. Life plans. I, uh... have no idea. I mean, I guess... Well, I left school when Mom got sick. Always figured I'd go back later. But then she... So I was thinking of reenrolling for the Fall. But I missed the registration cut- off, busy being dead and all...
Audit. Okay. That seems like a... pretty good plan. I guess. I mean, sure. I could do that. Right? What--what do you think, Giles?
I mean, I thought it might be weird being back. And, it is, a little but it's a good kind of weird.
You call your teacher "Mike?" Wow. School sure has changed since my day.
Will, I'm not following this too well.
Flow-going might be easier if your classmates weren't all big brains.
Maybe I should ease back in with some nice, breezy, non-taxing classes. Like “Introduction to Pies.” Or “Advanced Walking.”
Look, it’s okay. Just have to do a little more reacclimating than I thought. You know, get back up to speed so I can catch up to-- Oof!
What the f --
Tara!
Missed--? Tara, something freaky’s going on. It’s like I’m losing --
Tara! Wait! Come...
Diving right into the work force. Being the breadwinner. Building things with my hands.
Toting?
Well, I appreciate it. Muchly. You saved me from having to accept Giles’ offer to work at the magic shop. I mean, retail...? Gaaah. I’d rather be dead. Again.
No. Well, he implied it might have been stress related. Like I imagined it or something. I don’t know. Maybe... I guess I could’ve been blacking out. Although I did find this thing stuck to my sweater that went poof. Or blew away. Could’ve been lint. Or maybe evil lint...
Nice to meet you, Tony.
Uh, excuse me, but--
What? Wait! Where are you going?
It’s “Buffy.”
“Break a nail?”
I got it. Which way’s the stairwell?
...So, basically, I’m just trying to learn everything I can. ‘Cause I don’t want to just have a job, you know, I want a career. Something I can grow into...
Um, okay. Sure.
Well, I’m no structural engineer, but looks a little top heavy.
I didn’t do that!
What? No! I was saving you... There-- There were...
I can’t help where the forces of darkness attack me, Xander.
Can’t. They melted.
What?! You-- You were huddled in the corner. Crying. Like a baby.
Xander. I didn’t imagine this.
Really? You think they’re connected?
You’re firing me, aren’t you?
Is this all for research? Or some kind of stress test for the table?
So, situation normal, then.
I guess I’ll find my own style.
Mmm. Lemon Seduction. Nice. Eerrhm. Essence of Slug.
Oh, I saw one downstairs, but it was kinda hairy. Probably a Daddy Hand. I’ll get it.
Petrified Hamsters, the Dagger of Lex, eyeballs in honey, Mummy hand.
And you get the Dagger of Lex for free. See the inlaid pearl there, um, under the oozing black goo?
It’s playing dead. Little scamp.
Huh-what-huh?
We did this just now. We already did this. Giles, something’s happening!
Wait
Mummy Hand? You had that Mummy Hand look. Um... I’m sorry, I can’t get that for you.
Yeah, but there’s a... there’s a thing happening...
Then... I guess... I guess I have to get it for you.
Fingers sold separately.
That lady needs a Mummy Hand.
Anya, I could explain. But you’d just forget it.
No. No, I don’t think that’s exactly the problem.
Yes! And then I’m gonna marry Bob Dole and raise penguins in Guam.
Mummy Hand, right? You got it, lady.
If you like slug, go with the slug. She’s not gonna sleep with you anyway.
It’s you! You’re doing this!
I know we promised you a Mummy Hand. It’s just... I can’t get it for you. It’s... something’s wrong with it. It’s defective.
Thanks for shopping at the Magic Box!
Absolutely.
This is gonna be great.
Life is stupid.
There’s this thing-- someone’s doing stuff to me. Messing up my life. ‘Cept that it was kinda pre-messed already. School, and, and, jobs... pretty bad even without the evil.
Giles is working on it.
You’d do better?
‘S not my kind of fun.
Bleeeegh.
Are there drinks in your world?
Your motorcycle is loud.
Oh good, these are the lowlifes.
Ask him if he’s heard --
You’re gonna play cards?
You wanna play, that’s fine. I’m sticking to the plan. Who do I kill first to get information?
Kittens?! You’re playing for kittens?
I’ll do it.
Bleeeegh.
I’m not getting into a bar fight! I’ll beat ‘em up for information, great! But not to defend your right to gamble for kittens! Which, by the way, is a stupid currency!
Forget it. ‘M not playing by anyone else’s rules anymore. I’m done.
Scamper! Be free!
What’s wrong? You were gonna help me! You were gonna beat heads and fix my life! But you’re c’mpletely lame! Tonight sucks! And look at me! Look at Stupid Buffy! Too dumb for college! And, and, and Freak Buffy! Too strong for construction work! Then there was the store. I was bored to tears even before the hour that wouldn’t die! And the only person I can even stand to be with anymore is a neutered vampire who cheats at Kitten-Poker!
Also, I think you’re drunk.
That van.
I’ve seen it before. At the construction site.
‘M okay. I got it. Get off me.
He blew up. Did you see it?
Gotta love that. Makes ya feel strong, ya know? Powerful... Kinda sick...
For a second there I actually turned completely inside out. But yeah, better.
That’s okay. It wasn’t much of a fight. I got lucky.
No, it completely is. Because I let it set the rules. And even worse, I let all you guys do the same thing! Do this thing, be this way, blah blah.
The nice people at the phone company seem to think it’s not hard enough.
A check - - Giles, I can’t take this. It’s too much.
I was just being polite. I’m taking the money. This is great. More than great. Like, I don’t really know how to say this... I guess, it’s a little like having Mom back.
Wanna be my shiftless absentee father?
I’m just saying... Giles, thank you. So much.
Yep. Me. And I picked up dinner. Deep fried chicken parts.
S'okay. More for me.
What, so?
I don't. It's...not important. It's past. So I'll just keep this one to myself, if that's okay.

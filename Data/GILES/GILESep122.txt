You've no idea. You have to stop what you're doing.
Neither am I. Stay down.
I'm here to help you.
You concern me, Willow. Stay on this path and you're going to wind up dead.
Stay dow--
Vincire!
Contained her and her powers within a binding field. It puts her in a kind of stasis for the time-- You've cut your hair.
Yes. I noticed.
I came as soon as I heard...
The Council hasn't a clue. About much of anything, really. There's a powerful coven in Devonshire. They sensed the rise of a dangerous magical force here. A dark force, fueled by grief.
I hoped not. Then a seer in the coven told me about Tara... That's when the coven imbued me with their powers -
Buffy, what's happened here?
Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the majicks-
Duct tape?
Because they're just figments?
Of course. Why didn't we see it before?
I should never have left.
But I know you're all stupid. I shouldn't have abandoned you.
Sometimes the most adult thing you can do is ask for help when you need it.
Buffy, you have a calling -
The coven is working on a way to extract her powers without killing her. And should she survive, you ought to know... There's no guarantee she'll be... as she was.
Vincire!
Willow...
Tego!
Your powers... may be significantly greater... But I can still hurt you. If I have to.
I see. You lose someone you love and the other people in your life... The ones who cares about you become meaningless.
Go. And she does. Sprinting for the door.
Willow...
Incurso!
Perhaps... you're not as strong... as you think you are.
Willow. You need... to stop.
Willow... It doesn't... have to... be that way. You... you can... stop it.
No...
No.
Anya...
I can see...
Willow... I can see her... She took the magic I had and now... I know where she is... I can feel what her... (with dread) Oh, God...
Silly girl. I'm dying.
It was... It was the only way. I thought there'd be a chance now, but... I know where Willow's gone... She's going to finish it...
The world.
There.
It's not over.
No...
The threat's gone. Willow's been stopped.
She's alive. The magic she took from me, it did what I hoped it would...
W-well, I knew there was a possibility. The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of Magic. Which comes, in all it's purity, from the Earth itself. Willow's magic came from a place of rage and power.
How... could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into the spark of humanity she had left. Allowed her to feel again... Giving Xander the opportunity to reach her.
Yes. It was he that got to her in time. (looking at her) He saved us all.

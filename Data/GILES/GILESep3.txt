I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you ignore everything I say? As a rule?
You have a sacred birthright, Buffy. You have been chosen to destroy Vampires, not wave pom-poms at people. As the Watcher, I forbid it.
Dyeh, uh, well -- by appealling to your common sense, if such a creature exists.
I imagine not.
No.
Quite. Spontaneous human combustion is rare, and scientifically unexplainable. But there've been cases reported for hundreds of years. Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes.
Well, that is the thrill of living on a hellmouth -- one has a veritable cornucopia of fiends, devils and ghouls to engage -- Pardon me for finding the glass half full.
Rage. In most cases the person who combusted was terribly angry or upset.
Then we will have to determine who or what did. And deal with it accordingly.
Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy to disable and disorient them is a classic.
Why would someone want to harm Cordelia?
Then why was Amber set ablaze?
Someone doesn't like cheerleading.
Now I do want to make sure I've got this right. This witch is casting horrible, disfiguring spells so that she can be a cheerleader.
Priorities. Really, if I had the power of the black mass I'd set my sights a little higher than making the pep squad.
Let's be certain she's the witch before we arouse her suspicions. She's capable of some fairly ugly things.
We'll need a conclusive test anyway. There should be one - yes! The ducking stool. We throw her in the pond. If she floats, she's a witch; if she drowns, she's innocent. (off their looks) ... some of my texts are a bit outdated.
Ah! Yes. This should work. You'll need some of her hair, a little quicksilver and aqua fortis.
"Heat ingredients and apply to witch, if a spell has been cast in previous forty-eight hours witch's skin will turn blue." Oh, and you'll need some eye of newt.
They can't help her. This is a Bloodstone Vengeance Spell, hits the body hard, like drinking a quart of alcohol, then eradicates the immune system.
The others she just wanted out of the running, you she intends to...
I'm sure we have --
Couple of hours, three at most.
I've been researching that. We can reverse all the spells if we can get our hands on Amy's spell book --
The only other way is to cut the witch's head off.
She needs a sacred space with a pentagram, a large pot...
And keep her away from the science lab. We'll need it to cast our counter spells.
Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to you about your daughter.
Your daughter is up to something very dangerous. Are you aware of that?
I think you know very well.
This girl is very sick. You will shut up and you will listen to me. You daughter has access to some very powerful magics. Somehow your obsession with cheerleading has made her --
As her mother, you should accept some responsibility for her actions.
You're afraid of her.
I don't understand...
Good lord...
She locked herself upstairs. Where?
Show me.
My God...
I believe we can reverse your mother's spell. All of them, in fact.
Yes, but I need her books. There are certain volumes she would need for this kind of casting.
Collect those dolls, and all the personal --
Nice kitty... What were you guarding? Yes...
This is it.
We found.
We're going to school. And you're coming with us.
I'm going to stop this.
I promise. Just hang on.
We only have a few minutes.
Let's see... I'll need lead, sulphur, some sort of diacetate...
Find me a frog.
Right.
The center is dark. (in Latin) centrum est obscurus . The darkness breathes. tenebrae respiratis . The listener hears.
Hear me.
Unlock the gate, let the darkness shine. Cover us with holy fear. Show me.
Corsheth, and Gilail, the gate is closed. Receive the dark, release the unworthy... Take of mine energy and be sated!
Be sated! Release the unworthy!
Release!
Release!
RELEASE!
Well, that was interesting.
I think all the spells were reversed. Of course, it's my first casting, I may have got it wrong.
One doesn't want to be immodest, but I am not unsatisfied --
Well, it was the first time and some of those incantations are quite tricky. And I was somewhat interpretive with the ingredients --
Well, it wasn't exactly her.
I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you ignore everything I say? As a rule?

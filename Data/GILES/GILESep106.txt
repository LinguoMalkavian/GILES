Hello! Ahab! A little help?
He kept poking me with his hook. I sent him over to charmed objects. With any luck he'll poke the wrong one and end up in a parallel dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles who squashes annoying, teeny pirates. We've got a ton of bagging here. If you could start over here and -

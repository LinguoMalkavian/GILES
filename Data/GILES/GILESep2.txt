In time they lost their purchase on this reality, and the way was made for the mortal animals. For Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges: Certain magicks, certain creatures...
The books tell that the last Demon to leave this reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He was a human form possessed -- infected -- by the Demon's soul. He bit another, and another... and so they walk the earth, feeding. Killing some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out, and the Old Ones to return.
As long as there have been vampires, there has been the Slayer. One girl in all the world --
All right: They hunt vampires, one Slayer dies, the next is called, Buffy is the Slayer, don't tell anyone. I think that's all the vampire information you need.
Do you think they'd believe us?
You've no idea where they took Jesse?
Well, let's take an enormous intuitive leap and say they went underground.
If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it might indicate a meeting place. I suppose we could go to the building commission --
So all the city plans are just open to the public?
I think you should ease up on yourself.
Are you sure?
Then help me. I've been researching this Harvest affair. Seems to be some sort of pre-ordained massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on earth... Quite charmless. I am fuzzy on the details, however, and it may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine. That was a bit British, wasn't it?
I want you to go on the Net.
Do I have to tell you to be careful?
"For they will gather, and be gathered. All that is theirs shall be his... From the Vessel pours life." Pours life...
"On the night of the crescent moon, the first past the solstice, it will come." Of course. Tonight. CUT TO:
Buffy?
Not as of yet.
Did you find anything of interest?
Great! I mean, not great in a good way... Go on.
It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.
How about the end of the world.
This is what we know. Some sixty years ago a very old, very powerful vampire came to this shore, and not just to feed.
Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it Boca Del Infierno -- roughly translated: Hellmouth. A sort of portal from this reality to the next. This vampire hoped to open it.
Opening dimensional portals is tricky business. Odds are he got himself stuck. Like a cork in a bottle.
It comes once in a century, on this night. A Master can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds. Enough power to break free, and to open the portal. The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears this symbol.
Simply put, yes.
Well, there are a number of possibilities--
Then we need to get there. The sun will be down before long.
What for?
We're too late.
Right. Come on.
Come on! We've got to open the front as well!
I take it it's over.
People have a tendency to rationalize what they can, and forget what they can't.
Good. Next time you'll be prepared.
We stopped the master from freeing himself and opening the mouth of Hell. Doesn't mean he'll stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.
Not just vampires. The next creature we face may be something quite different.
We're at a center of mystical convergence here. We may in fact stand between the earth and total destruction.
The earth is doomed. BLACK OUT.

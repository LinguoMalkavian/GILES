I haven't gone through the new arrivals. Put it in that pile --
After I've examined it, you can, uh... skim it in.
Of course...
Ms. Calendar, I happen to believe that one can function in modern society without being a slave to the idiot box.
Well, I still prefer a good book.
That is a fact that I regard with genuine horror.
I have to stay and clean up. I'll be back in the Middle Ages.
Well, those boys aren't sparklingly normal as it is.
I do. But I don't really know how to advise you. Things involving the computer fill me with a childlike terror. Now if it were a nice Ogre or some such I'd be more in my element.
Well, I suppose you could "tail" Dave, see if he's up to something.
What was the name of the place?
It's just somewhat unprecedented.
We still don't know a terrible lot. Whatever's going on there could be on the up and up.
Your spider-sense?
Yes, well, I think we're at a standstill. Short of breaking into the place, I don't see --
A moment, please, of quiet reflection -- I did not suggest that you illegally enter the data into the file and then the book will be listed by title as well as author.
Hello.
A safe assumption.
Yes, we'll continue our conversation another time.
I am no such thing.
That's nonsense. I simply don't adhere to the knee jerk assumption that because something is new, it's better.
A society in which human interaction is all but obsolete. In which people can be completely manipulated by technology. Thank you, I'll pass.
These musty old books have a great deal more to say than any of your fabulous web pages.
How odd. I haven't looked through all the volumes, yet, I didn't --
Uh, nothing. A diary. Yes. I imagine that's it.
Yes...
Well, it was nice talking to you.
We must do it again sometime. Bye now.
She was only grounded for a moment. Still, if you'd been anyone but the Slayer...
Oh yes.
I think perhaps I do.
Does this look familiar to either of you?
Well, this particular book was sent to me by an archeologist friend who found it in an old monastery.
There are certain books that are not meant to be read. Ever. They have things trapped within them.
Demons.
In the Dark Ages Demons' souls were sometimes trapped in certain volumes. The demon would remain in the book, harmless, unless the book was read aloud. If I'm not mistaken, this is Moloch, the corruptor. A very deadly and seductive demon. He draws people to him with promises of love, power, knowledge. Preys on impressionable minds.
Dave, and who knows how many others.
Not anymore.
I didn't read it! That awful Calendar woman found it and it was already blank.
I don't know. And I don't know who could have read the book. It wasn't even in English.
In a pile, with the other books that were... scanned...
The scanner read the book. Brought Moloch out -- as information to be absorbed.
He's everywhere.
Willow scanned him into her file. This may be a futile gesture, but I suggest we delete it.
This is very bad.
Randomize traffic signals...
Destroy the world's economy...
All right, yours was best.
Damn.
What did you find?
My God...
How --
Horrible.
I have records of the ceremonies but that's for dealing with a creature of flesh. This could be completely different.
Even if she could, how am I going to convince her there's a demon on the internet?
Binding ritual... there we are...
Thank you for coming. I need your help. But before that, I need you to believe something you may not want to. (gathers himself) Something has gotten into... inside... (oh just say it) There's a demon in the internet.
You already know. How exactly is that?
It's Moloch.
I'm sorry, I have to say -- I mean, you don't seem terribly surprised by -- who are you?
A profession that hardly lends itself to the casting of bones.
Are you a witch?
Well, I definitely need your help. What's in cyberspace at the moment is less than divine. I have the binding rituals at hand but I am completely out of my idiom.
He was -- scanned is the term, I believe.
There's no time. Moloch seems to have fixated on Willow. We need to get him out now.
Buffy?
Form the Circle -- But there's only two of us. That's really more of a line.
Won't Moloch just shut you down?
'Hoping' and 'betting'. That's what we've got.
I am.
By the power of the devine... By the essence of the word... I command you.
By the power of the Circle of Kayless, I command you! Kayless. With a K.
Demon, COME!
I command you!
He's not in the book.
I'm remaining calm, thank you. I wanted to return this.
I found it among the new books and naturally, I thought of you.
Nothing could be further from my mind.
Yes, I know. I'll see you.
Truthfully, I'm even less anxious to be around computers than I used to be.
The smell.
I know. Smell is the most powerful memory trigger there is. A certain flower or a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten. Books smell -- musty and rich. Knowledge gained from a computer has no texture, no context. It's there and then it's gone. If it's to last, the getting of knowledge should be tangible. It should be smelly.
Well, it's true I don't dangle a corkscrew from my ear...

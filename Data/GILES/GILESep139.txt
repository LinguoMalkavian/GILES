A total catastrophe.
Have you seen the new library? It's nothing but computers. Not a book to be seen. I don't know where to begin... Buffy, who do we talk to?
Yes, of course. Rupert Giles. Buffy's told me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.
The seers in the coven are certain The First is continuing to gather its forces. The few Potential Slayers left across the globe are still being murdered before we can get to them. I'm afraid war is inevitable.
I can have my backup library sent from home, in the meantime. It isn't much, but--
Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeroes.
Ah, no. Actually my trip was on a different matter. Regarding Spike.
Buffy, I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose to remove the chip in his head.
Long story--
And that would be the abridged version.
Unless The First triggers him again.
Not anymore.
We don't know that the trigger's inactive. But I've brought something back with me that may help us to disarm it. And ascertain what it is, exactly, that causes Spike's behavior.
Yes, but he has no memory of it. Is there any part of it you can remember?
It will require a bit of magic.
Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you. There's something in your subconscious The First is using to provoke a violent reaction. So.
S'alright. It's completely painless. So I'm told. The Prokaryote stone will help unlock your subconscious to get to the root of the trigger's power. Help you understand it. Hopefully, break its hold over you.
The stone's only a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike. He needs to overcome whatever mental weakness is allowing his brain to be manipulated this way.
Willow...
It has to enter your cerebral cortex through the optic nerve.
I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
Spike. What do you remember? About the song...
And...?
Listen to me , Spike. What is it about your mother--
There has to be more to it than--
What are you doing?
Buffy --
Because he's not cooperating. The process takes time. He's blocking whatever's flooding into his consciousness, and as long as he does so, we're in danger.
As much as ever.
What's on your mind?
Spike.
Go on.
I'm not sure I--
Does seem doubtful The First simply forget it had such a powerful weapon.
Buffy would never allow it.
Yes, well, apparently you don't know very much about the Watcher/Slayer dynamic.
You what?
Crowley... Yes... I remember the name. New York based Watcher. Resigned shortly after his Slayer was--
Spike killed your mother.
Does Buffy know this?
And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance.
What... exactly are you proposing?
I'm still your teacher, Buffy. And, no matter how adept a Slayer you are, there'll always be new things to learn. Now more than ever it's crucial to maintain focus upon your calling.
Sometimes the most effective way of moving forward is to start at the beginning.
For what it's worth, everyone in your house seemed quite relieved by the arrangement. Buffy, I may not technically be your Watcher anymore... But the fact that there's chaos in your life only underscores the importance of the lessons I can impart to you.
Takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be a general, you need to make the proper decisions, regardless of cost.
Well, that's what we're here to find out...
Don't kill him yet.
Because I'm asking you not to.
Buffy.
And would you let him kill me, if it meant the same?
Things are different now, aren't they? After what you've been through. Knowing what you're up against. Faced with the same choice now... you'd let her die.
No.
That we can't allow any threat that may jeopardize our chances of winning.
And yet, there is Spike.
Spike is a liability, Buffy. He refuses to see that. And so do you. Angel left here because he knew how harmful your relationship with him was. Spike, on the other hand, lacks such self-awareness.
You want Spike here even after what he's done to you in the past?
Yes, and The First seems to be exploiting it to his advantage.
So was Ben.
He was a human being, after all. Forced, his whole life, to share his mortal form with a demi-god from a hell-dimension.
Ben was oblivious to the atrocities Glory committed. No more responsible for her crimes than Spike is to his, when triggered.
I put my hand over his mouth. And as he struggled, weakly... I smothered him. Because it had to be done. (looks at Buffy) He was a liability.
Buffy, it's time to stop playing the role of a general and start being one.
I understand your anger... but please believe me when I tell you we did what we did for the good of all --
That changes nothing. What I said to you before is still true. You need to learn --

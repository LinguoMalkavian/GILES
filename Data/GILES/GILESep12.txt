Ho korias phanaytie toutay tay nuktee. The Master shall rise... Yes, this is it. The Master shall rise, and the Slayer...
My God.
Oh... no...
Buffy...
No... and yes, we're safe.
I've been working.
Their numbers are increasing.
Yes...
I'm sorry. I'm glad you're all right but I need to verify... I just can't talk right now.
What?
Hello?... Yes, this is Rupert Giles. -- Yes I have. It's, um -- I need to talk to you. Here. -- No, I realize that. Come after sundown.
Not the best.
I'm sorry, but I'm really not up to socializing right now.
What do you know?
Where did these take place? What countries?
I don't know if I can trust you.
The Anointed One? But he's dead...
Who is this Monk?
I need you to talk to him. Find out everything he knows.
Just do it. And then I'll explain.
I will.
I've checked it against every volume I have. It's real.
Some prophecies are dodgey. Mutable. Buffy herself has thwarted them time and again. But this is the Pergamum Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
I wish to God I were. But it's very plain. Tomorrow night, Buffy will face the Master. And she will die.
Buffy, I...
I was hoping I wouldn't have to. That there was some way around it.
I don't know that anyone else can. The signs all indicate --
I don't suppose I am.
Buffy, if the Master rises --
Precisely.
Don't let that fool you. All right. I've told you enough. Did you get in touch with Brother Luca?
What did it say?
"The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them."
Yes... "A little child shall lead them..."
Depends on where he's leading them to. Aurelius wrote of the Anointed one, "the Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into Hell".
If the vampire Buffy killed was not in fact the Anointed, it may well be.
I don't plan to involve her at all.
Buffy isn't going to face the Master. I am.
Buffy, I'm not sending you out there to die. You were right. I've waded about in these old books for so long I've forgotten what the real world is like. It's time I found out.
I've made up my mind.
Well, I made up mine first. And I'm older and wiser and just do as I say for once. All right?
I don't care what the books say. I defy prophecy. I'm going. Nothing you can say will change my mind.
We stay calm, first thing.
As the soon-to-be-purple area on my jaw will indicate, I did not let her go. Buffy does as she will.
But we don't even know where she's gone.
The Master is as old as any vampire on record. There's no way to tell how powerful he will be if he reaches the surface.
Yes?
Good point. Check through the Black Chronicles, and, uh, Willow -- Willow.
Can you look through the town histories please? Search for any common denominators. Location of incidents and such.
I don't know. Hellmouth-sized.
Nor I. The Vampires have been gathering. They know he's coming. They will be his army.
The Bronze.
You two go. I'll concentrate on Demon killing.
Stay close together. And be careful.
What's going on?
But why are they coming here?
They're coming in through the stacks!
My office.
The Hellmouth...
The vampires?
Dead. And the Hellmouth has closed. Buffy?
I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd really like to get out of this library. I hate it here.
I'm not dancing, though.
No... and yes, we're safe.

No! Um, well... Yes, obviously.
Yes. As would I.
Buffy, there was some discussion during your absence about... Well, about what you're going to do now. Your plans.
I mean... With your life.
I want to be thorough. The time-anomaly and the demon attack could be unrelated events, but if they’re not, you’re in some danger.
Fill out two hold slips for each item.
Buffy, a little advice. While I ran the store I found it helpful to imagine I was back in the library.
Yes, yes. Quite right.
Buffy, a little advice...
...more apt to satisfy the customer.
Yes, yes. Quite right.
Say, Buffy, a piece of advice. If you think of the store as a library...
Yes, yes. Quite right.
Buffy, some advice --
Congratulations! Your first sale.
Oh dear. Well, it’s your first day. It was bound to happen.
I’m sure Buffy understands that.
Feel better?
I’m sorry I didn’t find this demon with my research. I’d like to have saved you the fight.
You were being sequentially tested by an unknown demon. I don’t see how that’s screwing up.
Well, that is an extremely awkward transition to me giving you advice. But I will. Go easy on yourself, won’t you? You don’t need to figure it out all at once, a job and all. You’re pushing yourself too hard.
Well, I may be able to do something about that. I, this, this is for you.
Fine. I’ll just tear it up then, shall I?
This is a scenario in which I am your mother?
Is there some sort of rakish uncle in this mapping?
No! Um, well... Yes, obviously.
Yes. As would I.

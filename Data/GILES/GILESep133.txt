Molly, take our new houseguest to the kitchen. I'm sure she's hungry after her journey.
Everything all right?
I'll have to warn the coven to be more cautious.
I don't know, Buffy. I've exhausted the few resources I have left with little result. The Watchers' records are still really all we have to go on.
There is one avenue we haven't tried yet... Beljoxa's Eye.
Beljoxa. An oracle-like creature. Exists in a dark dimension.
The thing is, only demons can open a gateway to it.
Still have friends in the fold. Well, murderous acquaintances, anyway.
I'm sorry. Could we possibly skip the recriminations of past--
Perhaps this might persuade you... Help us and the Slayer won't kill all your clientele and burn your establishment to the ground.
C'mon.
Where's the Beljoxa's Eye?!
I refuse to believe that! There has to be some way to destroy it!
You're saying The First will succeed in wiping out the line of Slayers!
If The First has been around for all time... why hasn't it attempted something like this before?! Why now?!
Opportunity?!
Then what caused the disruption?! What is responsible for letting this happen?!
Are you all ri--?
It's not her dying. The Beljoxa's Eye was clear... in its enigmatic way... It's because she lives. Again. Buffy's not responsible for that.
Anya--

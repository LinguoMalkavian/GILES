Good morning, Buffy.
... of course that would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the synchronized dancing from the room service chaps...
What did you sing about?
We should look into it.
I'VE GOT A THEORY THAT IT'S A DEMON A DANCING DEMON -- NYEHH, SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT THERE
--WHAT CAN'T WE FACE
--IF WE'RE TOGETHER
Thought it didn't matter.
What text?
Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at this point, so I'm open to anything.
I'm sure Willow and Tara are making every effort.
Well, I am following a few leads, and --
As ever, it's not quite that simple. But I have learned something quite disturbing...
Certainly emotions are running high, but as far as I could tell the victims burnt up from the inside. Spontaneously combusted. I just saw the one -- I managed to examine the body while the police were taking witness arias.
We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking for leads in the local demon haunts... at least, in theory she is. She doesn't seem to...
I'm helping her as much as I can, but...
Good. Good.
It may seem hokey, but we need to work on precision and concentration as much as power. We're still not sure what we're facing.
Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords we'll just lie down until they go away. Anyway, I don't think we need to work too much on strength.
Have you, uh, spoken with Dawn at all about the incident at Halloween?
Right.
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THE WORLD OUTSIDE YOU KEEP PRETENDING, BUT YOU JUST CAN'T HIDE I KNOW I SAID THAT I'D BE STANDING BY YOUR SIDE BUT I...
AND IT'LL GRIEVE ME 'CAUSE I LOVE YOU SO BUT WE BOTH KNOW
WISH I COULD STAY WISH I COULD STAY WISH I COULD STAY WISH I COULD STAY
What does he want?
No.
Yes we are. Buffy's going alone.
When I want your opinion, Spike, I... will never want your opinion.
It's up to you, Buffy.
Your best.
WILL THIS DO A THING TO CHANGE HER AM I LEAVING DAWN IN DANGER IS MY SLAYER TOO FAR GONE TO CARE
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO STRIKE A SPARK
She needs backup. Tara. Anya.
That's never gonna happen.
If it was at the shop, that means one of us had to...
THE BATTLE'S DONE AND WE KIND OF WON
SO WE SOUND OUR VICT'RY CHEER WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE

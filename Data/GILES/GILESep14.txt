So, what I'm proposing... and I don't mean to appear indecorous... is a social engagement... a date, if you will. If you're amenable... Idiot!
Oh, I, uh, I was just working on--
In a manner of speaking, yes.
England?
Well, thank you, Cyrano.
About Mexicans?
Right.
What makes you think that?
I am suddenly deciding that this is none of your business.
So, how did things go last night? Did Mr. Korshack show up on schedule?
Another vampire?
Grave robbing. Well, that's new. Interesting.
Yes of course. Terrible thing. Must put a stop to it. Dammit.
I'll collate some theories. Might help to know who the body belonged to.
Well, perhaps Willow can fire up the machine (points at computer) and track Meredith down.
Here's what I've come up with: demons who eat the flesh of the dead to absorb their souls. Or it could be a voodoo practitioner--
More likely, zombies. For most traditional purposes, a voodoo priest would need more than one.
Xander, Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
I think we're there.
Go ahead.
So much for all our theories.
But why dispose of the remains here at the school?
Yes, what student here would be that well-versed in physiology?
I hope you understand that as a school official, I can not condone this unauthorized search.
Yes of course.
Nothing remarkable here...
Fair to say, Chris is involved.
Oh. Yes. Hello.
What? Oh. Corpses. Evil. Very good.
Personalize it?
No! Don't leave me! Oh, dear.
Ms. Calendar.
You know, uh, Jenny, I don't mean to appear indecorous... no, not indecorous...
Oh, dear... I, uh... that is...
Well, what I am proposing is...
Idiot...
You're going to the football game?
I guess I just assumed you spent your evenings downloading incantations... casting bones.
Oh, uh, of course.
Okay... tonight, then.
I don't think we have to worry about that just yet.
Based on what the police put together, they're one step away from completing their masterpiece.
Yes of course. It accelerates neural decay in the brain cells.
Seconded.
I'm supposed to be at the, uh, the big game, I believe it's called.
Well, I really should --
All right.
Rugged? American football?
Well, I do find it odd that a nation that prides itself on its virility feels compelled to strap on forty pounds of protective gear just to play rugby.
Did you say... "date"?
No. But perhaps you should circulate down nearer the field to find her.
I am sorry about all this.
Believe it or not, since I've moved here to live on top of the Hellmouth, the events of this evening actually qualify as a slow night. Did you say, "second date"?

Can I help you?
Miss Summers.
I’m Mr. Giles, the librarian.
I know what you’re after.
Are you sure?
My mistake.
So, what is it you said –
Yes.
I was afraid of this.
Then why are you here?
Will he rise again?
The boy.
Can you be sure?
You have no idea what’s going on, do you? Do you think it’s coincidence, your coming here? That boy was just the beginning.
Because you are the Slayer.
Into every generation a slayer is born. One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One. One born with the –
--the strength and skill to hunt the vampires –
I don’t understand this attitude. You’ve accepted your duty, you’ve slain vampires before –
What do you know about this town?
Dig a bit in the history of this place and you’ll find there’ve been a steady stream of fairly odd occurrences. I believe this area is a center of mystical energy. Things gravitate toward it that you might not find elsewhere.
Like werewolves. Zombies. Succubi, incubi… Everything you ever dreaded under your bed and told yourself couldn’t be by the light of day.
Uh, yes.
The calendar.
I’m a watcher. I haven’t the skill.
The Slayer slays. The Watcher –
Yes. No! He – he – trains her, he prepares her –
It’s getting worse.
The influx of the undead, the supernatural occurrences. It’s been building for years and now… There’s a reason why you’re here, and there’s a reason why it’s now.
Something is coming. Something is going to happen here soon.
As far as I can tell, the signs point to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon – days, possibly less.
Right. This is me having fun. Watching clown-hair prance about is hardly my idea of a party. I’d much prefer to be home with a cup of bovril and a good book.
This is a perfect breeding ground for Vampire activity. Dark, crowded… Besides, I knew you were likely to show up. And I have to make you understand –
What did you say?
I’m not sure… Who told you this?
No… The Harvest… Did he say anything else?
Look at them. Throwing themselves about…. Completely unaware of the danger that surrounds them.
Or perhaps you’re right. Perhaps there is no trouble coming. The signs could be wrong. It’s not as though you’re having the nightmares…
But will you be ready? There’s so much you don’t know, about them and about your own powers. A vampire appears to be a normal person, until the feed is upon them. Only then do they reveal their true demonic visage.
The point is, a Slayer should be able to see them anyway. Without looking, without thinking. Can you tell me if there’s a vampire in this building?
You should know! Even through this mass and this din you should be able to sense them. Try. Reach out with your mind.
You have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, till you can feel every particle of –
What? Where?
But you don’t know –
It’s dated?
But… you didn’t hone …
Isn’t that –
What is she doing?
Is he dead? That was fast. Well done. I’d best go to the library. This “Harvest” is –
The vampire’s not dead?
What do we do?
I should come with you, no?

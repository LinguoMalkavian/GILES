Hey!
What?
Then why'd you tackle me, you burk? What was that supposed to do?
And, more importantly... you hit me! Why didn't your chip go off?
You had it removed?! You removed the chip.
You know this is very dangerous.
That's not what I mean.
Buffy, I have to ask. Why on earth did you make that decision?
What? I made that up! I knew the Bringer was behind me because his shoes squeaked! Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these girls safe, and I can't even keep track of the dangers: The First, the Bringers, random demons and now Spike?!
What?
Well, that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the- loose issue.
We have no way of knowing if his chip was functioning then. A new chip might be able to restrain him should The First attempt to activate him again.
Well, of course you trust Spike. He has slaughtered thousands, and therefore probably knows all about how not to do it.
Buffy...
I want better for you. Your feelings for him are coloring your judgment. I hear it in your voice. That way lies a future with a great deal of pain. I don't want that for you.
I see what's happening. It doesn't matter anymore if you're... if you're physical with each other. There's a connection there. You rely on him and he relies on you. That's what's affecting your judgement.
I hope you're right. You're gambling with a lot of lives.
Dear Lord, I hate that mall. The clerks are rude and everything in the food court is sticky.
And this language barrier is formidable. I was concerned because my Cantonese's a little... thin... and then it turns out she speaks Vietnamese, which is... thinner. But we muddled though. And, as I suspected, ice-cream is the universal language.
She is grateful to be in a land of plenty. (loudly to Chao-Ann) LET'S GO PUT AWAY THE NEW CLOTHES.
Anya, calm down. They're educational.
Those are flashcards. I made them to facilitate her training. Chao-Ahn never had a Watcher, and with the language problem...
I wanted her to understand the seriousness of her situation.
Perhaps I'll rethink the approach.
Buffy has a date?
Really?
For god's sake! How can anyone be thinking about their social life? We're about to fight the original, most primal evil, and these girls are all in mortal danger!
Back to Spike's question. Why did you try to record it?
This proves my point. This is a crucial time. We need to circle our wagons and stop doing things like going out on dates while there's imminent gunplay! Willow, call Buffy, get her back here. We have to dispose of that gun and figure out our next step.
Something's eating Xander's head.
They're still not back?
It is very late. Maybe a little reconnaissance isn't out of the question.
She says she can't sleep. I MADE MYSELF SOME WARM MILK. YOU CAN HAVE IT!
She's shy.
Children. Enough.
STOP!

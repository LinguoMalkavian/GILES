Caleb?
Where'd you get all this?
He's here.
It's a lot more than that. Buffy what you're talking about flies in the face of everything we've ever -- that every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it's bloody brilliant.
If you want my opinion.
I believe it is, if what Buffy has told us about this weapon is true.
You're going to do this, Willow. Get the coven on the line, see how they can help. I'll --
Yes, you --
I'll start digging up my sources. Literally, actually; there's one or two people I need to talk to who are dead.
I've gotten turned around. You're here.
That puts me here. By the door. Demons around the perimeter... right. So I open the door.
Bugger all. Fight.
What about my bag of illusions?
Could it possibly get uglier? I used to be a highly respected Watcher. Now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily. I wish I could just sleep.
Teams of two then, and I suggest you and I take the lounge.
Well, I think we can do better than that.
Well, no, aren't we gonna discuss this? We're saving the world to go to the mall?
And I'm just here, invisible to the eye, not having any vote...
The earth is definitely doomed.
Everybody! This way!
I don't understand. What did this?
There is another one in Cleveland. Not to spoil the moment...
Yes, because the mall was actually in Sunnydale, so no hope of going there tomorrow...
We have a lot of work ahead of us...

I was in the stacks. I got lost.
I didn't find anything particularly illuminating. I think perhaps you'd best have a talk with Wendell himself.
Do you know this girl?
I'm rather hoping Laura did.
Sorry to intrude on you like this.
You understand, we're anxious to make sure this never happens again.
Can you describe it?
Yes, you rest. You're safe now.
I'm sorry?
Yes. Yes it is.
Doctor, is she going to be all right?
Have you looked the word up lately?
We've got to get you back before your next class.
Yes. (looking at her) Are you all right? You look a bit peaked.
Are you... sleeping all right?
Can't be...
I've got back issues of the newspapers... trying to do some research...
I don't know.
I'm having a problem.
I... I can't read.
Five, actually, on a normal day - but the words here aren't making sense. (holds up a paper) It's gibberish.
Who?
The first victim. You've been seeing him around school?
The boy's been in a coma for a week. How is this possible?
Well... there's astral projection, the theory that while one sleeps one has another body, an astral body, that can travel through time and space...
In a manner of speaking. Though one doesn't always wake from a coma...
Astral body. And I don't know. We don't have much information to work with, as usual.
Pleasure.
She just stepped out, her father came by, he needed to speak with her - what happened, where are your other clothes?
And I've dreamt of getting lost in the stacks, of not being able to... of course.
Dreams? That would be the musical Comedy version of this. Our nightmares are coming true.
Billy.
A boy in the hospital. He was beaten - he's in a coma. Somehow I think he's crossed over from the nightmare world he's trapped in.
Things like that are easier when you live on a hellmouth.
Soon. Or everyone in Sunnydale will be facing their own worst nightmare.
Buffy doesn't know this is happening. and given the sort of thing she tends to dream about, it's imperative we find her.
Good idea.
No sign of Buffy?
You seem to be the only one.
This is getting worse. In a few hours reality will fold completely into nightmares.
The only thing I can think is to try and wake Billy.
Agreed. But who knows where she might have gone?
It's mine.
I failed in my duty to protect you... I should have been more cautious, taken more time with your training... but you were so gifted and the evil was so great.
Forgive me.
Buffy?
You never told me you Dreamt of becoming a vampire.
No, it's not. But there is a chance that we can make it go away. This is all coming from Billy. He's crossed over from the nightmare world to the waking one, and he's brought his reality with him.
If we can wake him, I believe the nightmares will stop. Reality will shift back to the way it was. But we must do it now. Can you hold together long enough to help us?
Thank you.
Positive.
Willow... do shut up.
Doctor! Is the boy Billy still -
Um.... (in his ear) Billy?
Billy! Billy you've got to wake up.
Why? From what?
What do we do?
Best get a doctor.

Hello, Faith.
She's still there. She'll call if the girl wakes up.
Well, Faith. I guess we should try to find a place to squeeze you in tonight.
But are you certain this is the best course of action? You don't even know what this man has of yours, if he in fact has anything.
It could be a stapler.
With the girls? Most of them have yet to be in the field at all, let alone in a life-or-death situation.
We know nothing about this man. We cannot go into battle without preparation. We need time.

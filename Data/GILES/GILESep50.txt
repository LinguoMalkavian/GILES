(entering from his office) Willow, get on the computer. I want you to take another pass at accessing the Mayor's files.
How did it go?
How did it go?
Do you feel up to taking Buffy out, or shall I?
Faith, The evaluations are a necessary part of --
Ah. Buffy. I thought you were going out tonight, didn't expect...
What is it?
She was... truly the finest of all of us.
Much, much better.
What makes you say that?
Sorry.
Well, something... something very strange is happening.
No. I don't want her in combat yet. Not around civilians.
Amazing.
We still have to get to the Bronze.
High casualty risk. I haven't any other plan, though.
All right. You go in, try to defuse the situation as much as possible. At least get a few of them to come outside. Even the odds a bit.
Right.
I think we're ready. (to Anya) Now, no tricks, dear.
Willow, if you'll complete the circle...

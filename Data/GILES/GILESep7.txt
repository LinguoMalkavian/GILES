-- Could I just steer this riveting conversation back to the events that took place earlier in the evening? You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires . . .
Did they look like this?
You encountered the Three -- warrior vampires, very proud and strong.
Yes, well, you weren't here from midnight to six researching it.
You're really starting to hurt the Master, he wouldn't send the Three for just anyone. We must step up our training with weapons . . .
Buffy and Angel aren't in immediate jeopardy. Eventually the Master will send others but the Three, having failed, will now offer up their own lives as penance.
Oh right, I forgot, the Master's such a kind and forgiving sort of chap.
Nothing. The crossbow comes after you prove your proficiency with the jousting poles which, incidentally, training.
You never know whom -- or what -- you may be fighting. And these traditions have been handed down through the ages, show me good, steady progress with the jousting and in due time we'll discuss the crossbow. Now put on your pads.
We'll see about that. En garde.
Good. Let's move on to the crossbow.
A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, the memories, even the personality of the person it takes over, but it is a demon at the core. There's no halfway.
It is the Slayer's duty.
Nothing about Angel in the texts, but then it occurred to me it's been ages since I read the diaries of the Watchers who came before me.
There's mention over two hundred years ago in Ireland of Angelus, the one with the angelic face.
Does your Angel -- this Angel -- have a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
Not that long for a vampire, two hundred and forty years or so.
Angelus leaves Ireland, wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades. Then, about eighty years ago, a most curious thing happens . . . . . . he comes to America where he shuns other vampires and lives alone. There's no record of him hunting here . . .
There's no record but . . . vampires hunt and kill, it's what they do.
Like all of them, a vicious, violent animal.
I just came to pay my respects, wish you a speedy recovery.
A little low, it presents like a mild anemia . . . you're lucky you got to her as soon as you did.
This is no ordinary vampire -- if there is such a thing -- he knows you, he's faced the Three, I think it's going to take more than simple stake.
What?
She makes quite an impression herself.
She lives very much in the now and of course history is very much about "the then", but there's no reason . . .
Darla. I don't believe I know . . .
Darla came to your house tonight, she was the friend you mentioned earlier?
Yes, someone should, right away. I'll do it.
We've got a problem.
Keep looking for her.
We have to stop her before it's too late.

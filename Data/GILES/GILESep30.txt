Still in the emergency room.
Was she hurt badly?
It's okay, Buffy. We'll get those vampires some other time! I hear it's best to just go along.
I think there's a phone...
We're very fond of her.
Thank you.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
May we come in?
Well, it's traditional among... people. (to Buffy) Did you pass the night well enough?
You were discussing 'stuff'?
Saw what?
Buffy, a frightened child --
Cordelia, have you ever actually heard of tact?
Hmm? Oh, I don't know. Maybe look into the history of the hospital, bizarre incidents, that sort of thing.
Well, I suppose... Cordelia may be Homerically Insensitive, but she may also be right. Disease and death are things -- possibly the only things-- that Buffy cannot fight. It would be natural for her to try to create a defeatable opponent. Especially now, after... after Jenny.
That no grown-up can see. Doesn't ring a bell. Unless...
Sometimes small children do see something we adults don't. Us. Our true selves. Our hidden faces.
Stanley Backer was the name, no?
The good Doctor Backer has something of a rap sheet.
Factor in Buffy's observation that he, uh, gives her the wiggins...
I just wish I knew what he was doing to these children.
Well. It looks like you were on to something after all.
The girl Tina -- it looks as though she died from the fever, simple enough. But her records show her improving and then suddenly worsening without apparent cause.
It would help if you knew what it was. It's invisible to you but the children can see it.
Right.
Fascinating though this is...
We'll call when we know something.
I'd best head for the library. Research beckons.
Well, keep alert, you two.
But why do I have to have -- (stops himself) Good thinking. I could use a research assistant.
What? Oh. It, um, extracts vital internal organs so that it can regenerate its own mutating cells.
It elongates its mouth to engulf the head of its casualty between its teeth.
It asks endless questions of those with whom it's supposed to be working but they're not getting anything done!
I'm not even sure we're going down the right track. Since this miscreant is only seen by select individuals, there's a chance we won't ever find a picture of it.
I found a picture of how it kills. Let me talk to--
Buffy, you still there?
The Kindestod gorges by sitting atop his prey, pinning it down helplessly. Then he slowly draws out the life. It must be horrifying for the victim. (a beat) Buffy?

Thank you, officer. I appreciate your help.
We really ought to go catch that flight back to... Interpol...
Same thing as everyone else. Hellmouth is active again.
Show me what you have.
Yes. Yes, excellent work. Very proud.
I don't see anything.
Then why is it in the file?
Oh.
Not sure. Here...
Shhhhhh. Pay attention.
See that knothole in the back wall?
Amanda, would you go down to the basement and get Spike?
I have a mission for you.
This is... serious. With real... (looking around the room) ...ramifications. Have a look.
I need someone who can handle himself in case Caleb left any... souvenirs.
You'll be fine.
Take Andrew.
There might be demons. Lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert, he can help.
He can bring that pan-flute thing of his. Excellent. Off you go.
My god. What...
Good lord. Is he...
Oh, yes, very much so, I think. Evidence that Caleb may have made inroads up north.
I sent Spike to look into it.
Yes. I sent Andrew with him.
Buffy... you weren't here. Some decisions must be made in your absence.
I did what I thought was right.
We are all watching your back.
Buffy --
What?
Faith thought the girls needed some time away from their studies, a chance to relax for an hour or two, I thought, given everything I learned from our time. (off Buffy's insistent stare) She took them to The Bronze.
Windmills.
Maybe. But we don't know that for sure.
And I think whatever is there, if anything is there, will still be there in a few days.
But didn't you just tell me today that you don't feel like you can trust us? Maybe there's something going on that we need to address.
Buffy, the rules have changed. And I'm not sure doing things the old way will help you here.
So how high does the price have to go before you start saying your way isn't right?
Yes. You. Think. But when you act alone --
If I acted rashly, it was to protect you. Were you trying to protect Annabelle? Or Chloe?
Or Molly? Or Xander? And it goes even further back than that, doesn't it?
You act alone, and people get hurt, right? People like Jenny
Do you see? You are not in the best place you have ever been. You're too raw. You need to take a break.

There, based on Buffy's description, I believe the men we're after look something like ... this.
I think we can safely assume they're human. So, no need to research.
Not very much, I'm afraid. It seems, once Again, you and I won't be needed to help Buffy.
Really.
That might be unethical.
It's just for reference. But you'd say it's fairly accurate?
Your man, actually. You are patrolling tonight?
Someone's got to find out what those people are --
Buffy, I appreciate your loyalty to a friend, but this...
Well, looks like we got our work cut out for us after all.
Very impressive. Where'd it all come from?
That was over two years ago. Are you sure you're still a hundred percent?
I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.
Raspberry fruit punch?
Oh, shut up.
I don't think I ever fully appreciated how Buffy deals with this every night.
Still, it's nice to be able to make oneself useful. I dare say we'll see some action before the night is through.
He's resilient...
We have to assume you're Spike's main target, Buffy.
You have a plan?
I'm sure of it.

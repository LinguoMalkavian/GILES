Buffy.
Sorry to barge in. I'm afraid we have a slight apocalypse.
Potential Slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them, all over the world. Now there's only a handful - and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
As well as their Watchers.
Yes. To erase all the Slayers-in- training and their Watchers, along with their methods...
That's because it pre-dates written history... And it rarely shows its true face. The only record of it I know was in the library of the Council.
Gone.
Obliterated. They were in session... There was an explosion.
Annabelle-
Not - I didn't... It must have been an agent of The First, after my little burglary session. The knowledge in the files had to be protected. There wasn't time for bureaucracy or debate, but the Council knows no other way.
Very little. It can change form, but only appears in the guise of people who've passed away.
Also, it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It works through the people it manipulates and its followers, The Bringers-
The First is unlike anything we've faced before. There's evil, and then there's the thing that made evil... The source.
That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. To defeat it... Honestly, I don't know... but we have to find a way. If the Slayer line is eliminated, then the Hellmouth will have no guardian. The balance will be destroyed... It falls to you, Buffy. We'll do what we can - but only you have the strength to protect these girls - and the world - against what's coming.
Of course, we'll use all our resources, but-
This place, where you last saw The First, you say it was in a Christmas tree lot?
Just in time for Christmas.
If we survive this, I promise to.
I miss you too.
So there was an entrance to the cave above ground here?
So we'll just keep-
Good lord, are you alright?
It's gone.
Yes. But, Buffy, are you sure we shouldn't discuss this privately?
What you fought was a vampire. But something more as well. It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, Turok-Han are to vampires. They're ancient, primordial, ferociously strong killing machines which live off blood, single-minded as animals. They are the vampires vampires fear. And until this morning, I thought they were myth.
Then until sunset, Buffy, you should rest. A few hours sleep will make a world of difference.
But you're exhausted.
Buffy - how exactly do you plan to research something as widespread as The First?
And the sun will go down in... (checks watch) ...seventeen minutes.
Sunset should be any minute now. We've done all we can. Don't worry, everyone here understands it's you calling the shots.
You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.
...which means we start back at square one.
I'm not sure. The First pre-dates everything we've ever known, or can know. It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know it we can fight it.
Buffy, I know you're tired...

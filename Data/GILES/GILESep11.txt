I’d say you’re right.
Well, I’m not sure this is the place for discussing it.
It is a bit of a puzzle. I haven’t actually ever heard of someone being attacked by a baseball bat.
Well, assuming the bat itself is not possessed, there are a few possibilities that bear investigating. Someone with telekinesis, the power to move objects at will... some invisible creature... or possibly a poltergeist.
Yes. An angry one.
I’ll research all the possibilities, ghosts included. Xander, may I count on your help there?
I believe it was a compound fracture. Not wonderful fun.
No I haven’t. I’ve seen one, in Dartmoor. A murdered countess, very beautiful. She used to float along the foothills, moaning the most piteous -- I’ve gone away again, haven’t I?
Yes. Well, from what I’ve read, having a ghost pass through you is a singular experience. It’s a cold, amorphous feeling, makes your hair stand up.
A girl on campus with the power to turn invisible.
It probably is having an awfully heady experience, having that ability.
I’ll start looking into ways to decloak an invisible someone. And you?
And how exactly do you propose to hunt someone you can’t see?
Who’s there?
Of course. Vampires cast no reflection.
Buffy told me you don’t feed on humans anymore.
Is that why you’re here? To see her?
A vampire in love with the Slayer. It’s rather poetic, in a maudlin sort of way. Well, what can I do for you?
The Vampire King. Yes, I’m trying to learn all I can about him. For the day when Buffy must face him. I haven’t learned much, I’m afraid.
I’ve studied all the extant volumes, of course. But the most important books of Slayer prophecy have been lost. The Tiberius Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex.
It was reputed to contain the most complete prophecies about the Slayer’s role in the End Times. But the book was lost in the 15th century.
That would be very helpful. My own volumes seem to be useless of late.
Oh, there’s an invisible girl terrorizing the school.
Nor mine, I’m afraid. It’s fascinating, though. By all accounts a wonderful power to have.
Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generation gap.
Of course! ...
I’ve been investigating mystical causes of invisibility when I should have looked to the quantum mechanical ! Physics. Reality is shaped, even created by our perception of it.
People perceived Marcie as invisible, and she became so.
Please sit down Do you know... I don’t recall ever seeing you here before.
According to what you’ve told us about the attack on Ms. Miller, we now have two messages from Marcie: Look and Listen.
Willow and Xander will help me begin our research anew.
Unless we can find a way to cure Macie’s invisibility, Buffy will be --
We don’t.
I mean apparently gift as a researcher is limited to supernatural rather than quantum phenomena. All these state functions, observables... Mathematics was never my strength.
Perhaps we can talk to her, reason with her. (off their reactions) Or possibly grab her.
Marcie. We know what has happened to you. Please talk to us.
What’s that sound?
Gas!
She’s snuffed out the pilot light! The gas is up full, but I can’t find the shutoff!
No! One spark and you’ll take the whole building with us!
That should give us a few minutes, but if we cannot escape this room...
The isolation, the exile she’s endured... she has gone mad.
Sparks... Sparks are caused by metal on metal...
One, two, three!
Again! Again!
We’ve still got to turn it off, or it could blow the building.
Janitor. Found us and shut off the valve.
I’d say you’re right.

I'm afraid I have to.
I know. But you have to be strong. I'm trying to--
Buffy please, this is hard.
I don't want to leave-
But you can. That's why I'm going. As long as I stay, when things arise that you feel you can't handle, you'll turn to me. And I'll step in, because... Because I hate to see you suffer.
And I'm loathe to cause you any more, believe me. But this is...
Now more than ever. The temptation to give up must be powerful. I can't let that happen.
Buffy. I've thought this over. And over. I think it's the right thing.
I don't think so. I hope not.
Sorry?
Dawn. There are no 'oogly-booglys'.
I'm glad you're here.
Spike?
Alright, then. If we've recovered from Spike's sartorial humor...
Yes, now-
Hello.
Perhaps we all got terribly drunk and we're having some kind of black-out.
Magic? Magic is all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing. Except I seem to be British, don't I? And a man. With glasses. Well, that narrows it down considerably.
Yes, we'll get back our memories and everything will be right as rain.
Welcome to the nancy tribe.
And you do inspire a particular feeling of familiarity... and disappointment. Older brother?
What did I do?
Her?
Resting together!
Oh.
Old! I'm young enough to still get carded--
I'm called, let's see, 'Rupert Giles'.
You're not too old to take over my knee... Son. What did I call you anyway?
Randy's a family name. Undoubtedly.
This is our magic shop? Well, that's... very progressive of me. You know it truly is a small mind that fails to acknowledge the, um, alternatives to our rational, scientific understanding of the universe. (changing subject) Oh look! Fancy herbs!
Alright then, let's head out.
Speaking as the proprietor of a Magic Shop, I propose we fight back. We can use things here in the shop, magic... tricks or whatever they call--
They seem to want spikes.
Perhaps magic can help us. It's worth a shot.
Come here please.
Good then.
Let's do some magic.
Sorry?
Uh.. Yes, quite right. So, which book shall we start with?
Oh good, it focuses on mind control or memory loss?
Fine. But as you'll recall, I too own a magic shop.
A paperwork type!
But you don't even know what you're--
Perhaps we should try another book.
That is clearly not a helpful book, dear. Come down and we'll go about fixing this in a sensible fashion.
Fine. Stay there and make bunnies. That's a capital plan.
Look, there's no way you remember me saying any of those words--
Get a different book. Put that book down. Do you hear me? Not that book. Bad book. Bad book!
Look what you've done now, you lunatic woman!
You know, it's no wonder I'm leaving you!
A one-way ticket to London and out of this engagement!
Himble voyon abri bara!
I'm so sorry, Dear.
Well, yes. Yes, it was. But I'm still sorry.
Oh. Oh, Anya.
Well, this place is certainly in need of a good tidying?
I'm afraid I have to.
I know. But you have to be strong. I'm trying to--
Buffy please, this is hard.

Just because the paranormal has been more normal and less… para lately, that is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down.
Oh really? You yawned your way through weapons training last week, you skipped hand to hand entirely – I suppose you’re prepared if some demon springs up behind you and does this!?
Buffy, you think I don’t know what it’s like to be sixteen?
I may not know precisely –
You’re still…? That is dicey.
Ahh, but you see that’s just where being different comes in handy.
Yes! You have a duty, a purpose, you have a life long commitment. How many people your age do you think can say that?
Well here’s a hard fact of life: we all have to do things we don’t like. You have hand to hand this afternoon and patrol tonight. You’d best come right here after sixth period and get your homework done. Don’t dawdle with your friends.
I’m going to attack you. Word of caution: for your own good, I won’t be pulling any punches.
Good. So you’re on patrol and I’ll see you in the morning. Thanks, no, I’ll just rest here for a while.
What if a vampire came up behind you and did that!
I don’t see –
Blood…
Good idea. She’ll patrol, we’ll reconvene after school –
Why not?
Oh, if you’re not feeling…
You need to be home with your mother.
Sent.
Lent.
Her boyfriend’s name is Kent.
What are you doing?
A missing girl…
Callie Megan Anderson… missing for over a week. No one’s seen her, no one knows what happened to her…
I’m calling Buffy.
Why not?
Are sick. You’re right, we shouldn’t disturb them until we know more.
A year ago…
An anniversary… or some other event that has significance for the killer.
No. But this being Sunnydale and all…
We need to know where Buffy found that bracelet – and begin a search from there.
Miner’s Woods, which is…? -- what are you doing?
A fraternity?
We don’t know this is concrete, let’s not disturb her until –
She… lied to me?
Why are you wearing that…?
They may be involved in some kind of ritual.
And you nearly got devoured by a giant demon-snake. I think the words “let that be a lesson” are a tad redundant at this juncture.
I am, too. I drive you too hard, because I know what you have to face… from now on no more pushing, no more prodding…

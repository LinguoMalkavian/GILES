Andrew, things are getting very dire around here, and we've got more important things to worry about than -- Ooh! Jaffa Cakes!
Did you find Buffy?
Well, I'm afraid there's rather worse news here...
Good.
Watch her head.
Still not conscious, though.
And, ignoring that, I'd like to point out: (re: scythe) It's really quite ingenious.
So in addition to being ancient, it's clearly mystical.
It's hard to imagine something like that could exist without my having heard of it.
Right. Is there any chance it's something besides a tool to kill things?
We'll start work immediately.
No. It's far older. Pre-Christian.
Native American?
I've found reference to the Sword of Moskva, and the Reaper of the Tigris. I don't see how we're going to narrow this down. There's never a clear enough illustration.
Willow? Do you feel the power Buffy talked about?
Tapping into some Magicks might help with that.
Willow... you know there's a way to do it without endangering yourself. Drawing positive power from the earth, the power that connects everything...
But if it's necessary...?
Do what you can, Willow. That's all any of us can do.
I can't imagine -- Wait. Let me see.
It's a sort of... gulpy noise. I'm remembering something here... hieroglyphs... hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know.
The consonants "m" plus glottal stop, are represented by a little picture commonly thought to represent a sickle or scythe. It appears in thousands of carvings, in Egypt and throughout the ancient world.
Let's go back... see what else we can find about that temple.

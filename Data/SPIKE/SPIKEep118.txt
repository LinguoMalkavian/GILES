How you doin'?
(re: the dangling vamp) Here, I could take care of this guy if you want.
I mean, sure he don't look like much...
... but I'd wager he could give you a bit o'nasty. I'll save you the staking. All you gotta do is--
Right. Well, I'll just be dropping him down to you then?
(calling after her) In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?
Like Hell.
What's this?
Yeah, I got that part. Why am I holding it?
Oh, the great Xander thinks so! Shudder gasp! It must be true!
That ponce has always had it for me. Every chance he gets, he sticks it --
I don't hurt you .
No, you don't. I've tried to make it clear to you, but you won't see it. Something happened to me. The way I feel... about you... It's different. No matter how hard you try to convince yourself it isn't. It's real.
Get out.
Hey. I need a thing.
Fresh of out of pleasure. That's why I'm here. I need something. Numbing spell, maybe?
Sorry to bust up the little girls' night out.
Right then. Got something that'll dull the ache a bit?
...and then this girl says "real for you-"
Xander. Let's not waste any more breath on that wanker-
I care. What he did to you, I've never stooped that low, and I'm an "evil, souless thing" according to some people-
Absolutely. (re: chip) Take him on myself if it wasn't for my little handicap.
You name it, pet. You're the wronged party. Something gruesome, how 'bout?
Right! An' I didn't ask for this bloody chip in my head-
Me too. The using part. I just wanted to know what I was missing, move on.
She was so raw. Never felt anything like it...
Right.
Exact- (catches himself) I have no dance.
To the rafters!
Never! I was always going above and beyond. I saved the Scoobies how many times? And I can't stand the lot of you.
You do.. That's why you're the only one of them I wouldn't bite if I had the chance.
Absolutely. I have nothing but respect for a woman who is forthright. Drusilla was always straightforward. Didn't have a single buggering clue about what was going on right in front of her, but she was straight about it. That's a virtue.
That's because he's one of them. Uptight. Repressed.
Please. It's no wonder they couldn't deal with the likes of you and me, Luv. We both should have been dead hundreds of years ago - and we're the only ones that are really alive.
Here. Ladies last.
Take it quick or my chivalry'll run out.
Intimately.
Yeah.
Shhhhh-
Now now...
The two of them, they're weak is all. Tell you one thing. They're going to miss the water now that the well's gone dry.
Too hot...
Hmmmmm.
I'll show you mine...
Moving on.
See? Forthright.
Not gonna fight you. Chip.
Good enough for Buffy.
Stupid tossbag. You know, I wish he would --

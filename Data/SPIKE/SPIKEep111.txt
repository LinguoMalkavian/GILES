(real casual) 'Morning.
Just... taking a stroll. Found myself in your neck o' the woods.
Yeah, well, fact is my lighter's gone missing. Thought it mighta dropped outta my pocket last time I was here
What?
Don't flatter yourself, Luv. Bloody fond of that lighter.
So what should I call you then? "Pet?" "Sweetheart?"
So, we gonna chat this out or what?
No worries. I'll wait.
Oh, right. Hey, Buffy's a great mum. Takes good care of her li'l sis. Like, when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it.
Thing, yeah. Uh, my blanket.
Just thought you'd want--
Just getting what I came for. Luv.
Whatever beastie you are... I know you're here. And I hurt beasties.
(thinking fast) What am I...? What's it look like, ya nit? I'm... exercising, aren't I?
Man shouldn't use immortality as an excuse to let himself go. Gotta keep fit for the killing.
So, what, you just come here to criticize my housekeeping?
Haven't seen her.
(feigning surprise) Yeah? Huh. How did, uh--?
Uh, tell you what. I'll take a peek around first chance I get. And if we bump into each other, I'll clue her you're on the lookout.
Yeah. Right.
That was bloody stupid.
Perfect for you.
What I want... This vanishing act's right liberating for you, in'it? Be anywhere you want. Do anything you want. Or anyone.
Only reason you're here is that You're not here.
Both know it's true, Luv. So, skip the denial. May not be able to see you, but I can still see through you.
Not too put off by it though, are ya?
Fun's over. Just go. Get dressed, if you can find your clothes and push off. 'Cause if I can't have all of you, I'd rather--

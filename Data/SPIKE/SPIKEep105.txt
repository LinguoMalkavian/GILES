I have a dim memory of that, yeah. And I didn’t figure you were here cadging my whiskey cuz life is all blood and peaches.
So you’re just, what? Gonna let this -- whoever -- play you ‘til it figures out what kills you?
Oh, good. Cuz Giles, he wields the Mighty Force of Library Books.
Damn right. I’d hit the demon world. Ask questions, throw punches, find out what’s in the air. Fun, too.
Yeah. It is. And your life’s gonna get a lot less confusing when you figure that out.
You’re not a schoolgirl. You’re not a shop girl. You’re a creature of darkness, like me. Try on my world, see how good it feels.
My usual, Dave. And one for the lady. (to Buffy) We’re headin’ for the back room, pet. ‘S where the real action is.
These lowlifes know everything happens in this town.
Fine. Little louder.
Later.
I need a moment with my lady.
Listen. These guys talk while they play. We’ll get more information out of their mouths than out of gaping holes in their corpses.
So who wants to advance me a tiny tabby, get me started? C’mon, someone’s gotta stake me.
Got my good luck charm with me.
Me? I cheat? He’s got X-ray vision!
Ahh! It’s a set-up, in’t it? Squeeze a few quid outta the vamp? Tell you what you didn’t count on, though. Me and the bird. You want a fight, you face the two of us.
C’mon, Slayer! A big fight’s just what you need!
I won those!
What’s wrong, love?
Oh. Saw the cheating, did you?
You wanna steal a van, I’m with you, love. But we have got the motorbike.
I saw. He’s gone.

Out! This is my place! You need permission to be here. You need a special slip with a stamp!
Can't you see? Read it on my face. LOOK!
You go off and try to wall up the bad spots, put your heart back in where it fell out, and you call yourself finished, but you're not. You're worse than ever, you are.
Tragedy. Is there blood?
Didn't see it, never saw it. Didn't say I did. You did it once. I heard about it.
Lots of things like skin. I mean, who doesn't like skin?
Look at you, glowing. What's a word means glowing? Gotta rhyme.
I should hide, hide from you. Hide my face. You know what I did.
Not the time. Not the time. Prob'ly better left unsaid anyway. Unsaid things grow healthy in the dark, little tadpoles... Everyone's talking to me, no one's talking to each other.
Someone isn't here. Button, button, who's got the button? My money's on the witch. Red is a bad girl. They made her go away, you know. She told me. Shh.
They think you did it.
...and you call yourself finished, but you're not. You're worse than ever, you are.
You went away.

They think you did it. The Slayer and her boy. They think you took the skin.
I have to go. There's things here without permission and I have to check their slips, make sure they have authorization.
William's a good boy. Carries the water, carries the sin. It's supposed to yet easier, in'it? It's s'posed to help to help. 'Cept it doesn't. And it's still so heavy...
This is it. End of the line, everyone off. (to Xander, intensely) Keep your ticket. You'll need that.
'S got a cave in it. Look.

Well, This can't be good. You being here at this hour. Trouble?
Right, none of my business. No worries.
S'alright.
Knew him, huh. That musta been a picnic.
Well... I'm qonna turn in before I drop. 'Night.
Anya. Do be specific and tell a fella just what exactly you are doing here.
Beg pardon?
Wait - wait Anya, just a minute now, this is not exactly... is that a stake?
Yeah, I guess, but what are you...
Zipper stuck?
Anya...
Not so much.
Obviously, if things were different, you're a right catch.
What?
Nonsense! The do's quite fetching.
Love it!
Anya...
Oh come on now, I just explained to you...
I need my pants.
Didn't mean to hurt your feelings, luv.
Right. Look it's getting dark, I've got things to do.
Buffy?
What?
What girl? What are you talking about?
Did you... Are you following me?
Who knows? I talked to her, is all!
Well I sure as hell didn't off her. Where are you getting this? You know I can't -
Not the chip. Not the chip, damn it - You honestly think I'd go to the end of the underworld and back to get my soul, and then start killing again? Buffy - I can barely live with what I did when I was William the Bloody. It haunts me. All of it. You think I'd add to the body count now, you're crazy-
Is that what this is. Right...
You're jealous.
You saw me chatting up a bird, giving the eye to someone else? Struck a nerve, did it?
It burns, huh? But you can't admit it, so you trump up some story about me being back on the juice-
Told you what? That I go out? Yeah, I talk to people, women. I talk to them because I can't talk to you.
And as daft a notion as "Soulful Spike the killer" is, it's nothing compared to the idea that some other girl could mean anything to me. This chip is something they did to me. I couldn't help it. But the soul I got on my own. For you.
And everything I felt, feel - it only cuts deeper now. I pass the time with someone... That's all it is - time. God help me, Buffy, it's still all about you.
That doesn't mean-
And you believe him? Vampires, not notorious for their honesty-
You can't know that-
We talked. That's all I remember.
I don't know - the nights... I go out. I talk to people. Or I don't. It's boring. It all bleeds together.
Not that. The taste of human blood? That I'd remember-
No . You're wrong. You've got an accusation from a pile of dust - and not a shred of proof.
And if you don't? What's it going to take to make you believe in me?
I have to go.
I know what the Slayer told you. It's not true. Let me go and I'll find a way to prove it.
She had brown hair. Nice looking girl. I was here talkin' with her...
...two nights ago. I'm looking for someone mighta seen her...
What's that?
Just looking for a certain brunette I met here the other night.
Sorry, luv. Don't think so.
Friendly Warning, pet. I'm the type best left alone.
Get away from me.
No... I didn't... That wasn't me.
No.
It's me. I... I'm seeing... I think I remember... I think I've done some very bad things.
I need... I need to see you... There's a house. 634 Hoffman Terrace.
I did some bad things here.
Down here.
You're not here.
I've... I've been remembering. A girl. I walked her home. The one you saw. And the one before that...
Over here. I think I buried them here.
Well I dunno, do I? Don't even know how. I shouldn't be able...
I remember.
Do it fast, all right?
Me. It was me. I saw it. I was here the whole time. Talking. and singing. There was a song...
I don't know. Please, I don't remember. Don't make me remember. Make it so I forget again! I did what you wanted!
No, please... I need it. I can't cry this soul out of me. It won't come. And I... killed... And I feel it... I feel every one of them...
What is it? Why is it doing this to me?
Help me. Can you help me? I don't know why I did this. Or how I did this. And I'm... I need help.
Well, This can't be good. You being here at this hour. Trouble?
S'alright.
Yeah, I guess, but what are you...

Well, all right! Got the moves, don't you? Gonna ride you hard before I put you away, luv.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Taken me a long time to track you down. Don't really want to end the dance so soon, do you, Nikki? Music's just startin', in'it?
Little tip, mate. The stake's your friend, don't be afraid to use it.
What?
What you doin' here? Came to see the show?
Uh huh. Right. Let's get this over with. What're you gonna do? Some hypno- beam or disarming spell?
Bugger that.
And how'd you expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
You've got to be joking. What now? In the ear? Up the nostrils?
Oh, bollocks-- All the rubbish people keep sticking in my head... it's a wonder there's room for my brain.
Yeah...
How'm I suppose to know if this bug ugly's doin' its--
Get me out of these sodding things already! I'm fine.
I am calm. Stone o'yours is out, in'it? Did its job. So, I'm de-triggered, right?
Yeah. The song. 's called "Early One Morning." Old folk ditty...
Mean? Nothing. Just... My mum...
No "and." That's it.
I dunno. We got on fine. She was a good lady.
Well, there bloody well isn't.
Mother...
And?
Yeah, okay, I get it. Look, that leech-thing did a number on me but... I'll be fine.
What'd you got in mind?
You sure about that?
Live in a garage?
Little place to unwind, huh...
Hard day's principal-ing got you down, need a place to cut loose, let down your hair... So to speak.
What the bloody hell's this?
Bit much, in'it? What's your story, Wood?
Sorry. Not much for the self- reflection.
That right?
Killed a lot of people's mothers.
So, that's it, is it? Brought me here to kill me?
NNOOO!!
I'm sorry.
Wasn't talking to you.
She knew what she was signing up for.
Well, that's the rub, in'it? You didn't sign up for it, and somehow that's my fault.
She sure loved you, didn't she? Enough to risk her life, night after night...
You weren't hers. Doesn't it piss you off?
I know Slayers. No matter how many people they got around them, they fight alone. Life of The Chosen One. Rest of us be damned. Your mum was no different.
So she said, I expect. Not enough to quit, though, was it? Not enough to walk away. For you.
...before I kill you.
I gave him a pass. Let him live. On account of the face that I killed his mother.
Well, all right! Got the moves, don't you? Gonna ride you hard before I put you away, luv.

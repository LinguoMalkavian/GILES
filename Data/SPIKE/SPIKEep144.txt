So where's Tall, Dark and Forehead?
Yeah, that and I also used my heightened vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.
Just popped round for a quickie, then?
He wears lifts, you know.
No problem at this end.
Where's the trinket?
The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power. I believe it's mine now.
Someone with a soul, but more than human... Angel meant to wear it, that means I'm the qualified party.
You need someone strong to bear it then. You were planning on giving it to Andrew?
Been called a lot of things in my time...
You're talking to the wrong guy, love. This is powerful.
Well you're not staying here! Can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk -- you've got Angel breath.
Clearly you don't, since that whole "having my pride" thing was a smokescreen.
I don't know what I would have done if you'd gone up those stairs.
I'm drowning in footwear!
Time to go to work, love.
Not to be a buzzkill, luv, but my fabulous accessory isn't exactly tingling with power.
I'm getting zero juice here. And I look like Elizabeth Taylor.
Uh, Buffy...?
Oh, bollocks.
Buffy...
I can feel it, Buffy.
My soul. It's really there. Kinda stings.
Go on, then...
No. You beat 'em back, it's for me to do the clean up.
Gotta move, lamb. I think it's fair to say school's out for the bloody summer.
I mean it. I gotta do this.
No you don't. But thanks for saying it.

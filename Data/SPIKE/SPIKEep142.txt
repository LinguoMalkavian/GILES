Tapestry.
Tapestries the only things in the whole bloody room.
I'll look deep in your jugular, s'what I'll look deep at.
I'm not -- don't you say another word.
What is wrong with you? Don't you understand what's happening here?
And ev'ry minute we're stuck here, the Slayer's back there, facing hell know's what...
All right! I'll play if you want.
It's that or bash my head repeatedly against this wall.
A "Y"? There's nothing here that--
Shoulda picked the bashing.
Hey.
He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? Thank god I don't breathe.
When's she get back?
I see. Uh-huh. Been practicing that lit'l speech long, have you? So Buffy took some time off, right in the middle of an apocalypse. And it was her decision?
Yeah, you all decided.
That's ballsy of you. You're her friend and you betray her like this?
You know, I think I do. Rupert. You used to be the big man, didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. And now she's surpassed you, and you can't handle it.
Is that right?
Alright.
Finally got what you always wanted, didn't you?
Do you realize I could just walk in here, no invite needed? This town really is theirs now, isn't it?
No, this'll change your tune. I came here 'cause I got somethin' to tell you: You're right. You've been right since the beginning.
You're not foolin' me.
You're not a quitter.
Buffy, no. You were their leader and you still are. This isn't something that you gave up; it's something that they took.
We can take it back.
"No"?
You mean no as in, eventually?
I don't understand. I don't understand you one bit.
You can get them back.
They need you!
It's bloody chaos over there without you!
Yeah yeah, it's, uh --
There's... junk, food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up... everyone's very scared and uh, unkempt...
Look, I didn't see a lot. I came, hit Faith a bunch of times and left.
Say the word and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like a painful accident...
There's always casualties in a war.
Okay, first mistake --
I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.
You think that's all it was?
No. Hold on here, I've hummed along to your pity ditty, I think I should have the mic for a bit.
You're insufferable.
I'm not trying to cheer you up!
I don't know! I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off and I just... Unattainable! That's it!
You listen to me. I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I'd prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker; I follow my blood, which does not always rush in the direction of my head. So I've made a lot of mistakes. A lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred plus years, only one thing I've ever been sure of. You.
I don't want to be this good-looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear.
Sure.

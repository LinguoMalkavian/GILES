Honey, you're home.
And you did it. Fulfilled your mission, found the holy grail, or the holy hand grenade, or whatever the hell that is.
Pointy and wooden is not exactly the look I want to know better, but it does have flair. I can see how a girl would ditch a guy for one of these.
Doesn't matter. You're back in the bosom, all's forgiven, and last night was just a glitch. A little cold comfort from the cellar dweller, let's don't make a thing out of it.
Another solo mission, of course.
It's fine. Don't have to get shirty about it.
All right, all right. Big secret mission. It's fine.
And this is the thing Preacher Man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts.
Well, maybe I'll swing by his place while you go, make sure he's sitting tight.
Okay.
I'm what?
Have you gone completely Carrot-top?
Terrified.
Last night was... God, I'm such a jerk. I can't do this.
It was the best night of my life.
I know, I hear you say it, but... I've lived for sodding ever, Buffy, I've done everything -- I've done things with you I can't spell , but I've never... been close. To anyone, least of all you... Until last night. All I did was hold you, and watch you sleep, and it was the best night of my life. So I'm, yeah. Terrified.
Were you there with me?
What does that mean?
No. Not right now.
No. Let's just leave it.
We'll go be heroes.

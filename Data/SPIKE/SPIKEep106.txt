Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
Why does everyone always think I'm lurking about?
Came through the tunnels. Running low on Burba weed. Stir it in with the blood, makes it all hot and spicy.
Three to a jar. They tend to go a bit wonky if you cram 'em too close.
Feel like a bit of the rough and tumble?
Me. You. Patrolling? Hello?
Might if you let them out.
Not like I don't already have plans. Great Pumpkin's on in twenty.
Ahhh!
Giles found you?
Yeah. It's Dawn --
No, it's okay. Giles came by earlier looking for you. Dawn and her little friend pulled a Houdini. Up to a bit of candy corn mischief, I suspect.
Kid's these days, eh? I just did a sweep of the tunnels. Giles is poking about the cemetery --
Don't think she's in there.
This a private game, or can anyone have a go?
It's Halloween, you nit! We take the night off. Those are the rules.
No, I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.
Guess I should bugger off. Something about Big Bad's not venturing far from their crypts on Halloween?

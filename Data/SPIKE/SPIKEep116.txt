Like you to meet my date.
So, yeah. Anyway, that's my date. She's with me. My date for the wedding.
Hello, Buffy.
Happy occasion. You meet my friend?
Is it working?
I'm sorry. Or... Good! You want us to go?
That's not true, you... God this is hard.
I think we'll go.
Yeah I suppose... that was the idea.
Evil.
But I won't. Or I... I'll just go. Give 'em my best or whatever. The happy couple.
It's nice, watching you be happy. For them, even. I don't see it a lot. You, um... you glow.
Yeah...
(very quiet.) Thanks.
Come on, let's go.
Let's just piss off, all right?

Yeah.
Yeah, he's gonna miss me ever so. But gives us all a breather, eh?
From the constant pitter-patter of clomping teenage girlie feet.
Oh, come off it.
It's like a bloody war zone up there. And not in the fun way.
I'm just trying to stay out of their way.
This is better, believe me. Safer.
With you at my side, yeah. You'd never let me hurt one of 'em. And that's how it's gonna be until we're sure The First is done making me its bitch. We're together or I'm on the leash.
Buffy...
Ow.
Ow . Ow!
I don't... god. Why would...
Popped another blood vessel, I think.
Or maybe I just wasn't supposed to last this long.
Good. Try "behavioral modification software through the ages."
Who you gonna call? God, that phrase is never gonna be usable again, is it?
Listen, pet...
This one seemed easier than the others. See? Probably just gonna fade...
Buffy...
Buffy...
Chip fired again.
Just gimme some space. I'm gonna be fine.
I know.
Maybe we can't wait.
Guess here we are.
You sure you still wanna go back in this place with me?
Dunno. Worked pretty good when I was living in residence here. Any time I got a little... rambunctious, the chip would kick in, I'd feel like my head was gonna explode, they'd dope me up, and everything would be all daffodils and teddy bears. For a couple hours, anyway.
I'll take whatever we can get.
Yeah. You never really get used to that smell, do you?
Buffy.
They just sealed the place off. Left everything as it was.
Yeah, you're not wrong.
You hear that?
Think something survived?
You see where?
Oh god, no. Not now.
What's happening...?
Yeah, he's gonna miss me ever so. But gives us all a breather, eh?

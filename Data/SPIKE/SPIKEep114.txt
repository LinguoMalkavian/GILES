Yeah, Willow mentioned the shindig, figured we're all part of the team, thought I'd swing by.
You know. More. Merrier. That whole thing.
Stupid git.
Wanna slip away for a minute, love? I'll let you blow out my candles.
Why, worried about Richard? Don't wanna make the new boyfriend jealous, eh?
Shut up, he's sweet.
Right! 'Cause it's the floppy hair I find so intimidating.
Ohhh, Buffy, might I get you a soda pop? I think I'm in looooove!
Mmmm-hmmm.
What. It's a thing.
Must be some late-night activities to keep us busy till morning.
What? Oh. Yeah...
You should definitely go, let's find your coat, get you on your merry way.
Me either. 'Sides, Richie, can't skip breakfast, growing boy like you. Me, I used to love breakfast. (glaring at Richard) In the old days, I probably would have eaten by now.
Yeah? Dunno, tummy's makin' all kinds of gurglies, maybe I oughta just feed on whatever's around, even if it doesn't go down well. You work out?
What, poor, dainty Richard can't take a joke?
What are you gonna do? Beat me up again?
And I was insane to think - - oh, wait. You were right, you're insane.
Yeah, well, can't. Daylight.
I'll get the door!
Fine!
Me too.
Things we'd rather be doing.
Hey, I don't wanna keep you from all the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group could meet later? Say when we're not trapped in a house?
Or something.
Spike.
Um, right, when you're done being a wanker, we are trying to help you.
Nope. Can't.
So, you ever think about, maybe, not celebrating your birthday? Just to try it, I mean?
Well, we can't just stay put like cattle, waiting for the thing to pop out every time it gets peckish.
Look - -
The sword! Get the bloody sword!
Hey, wait a minute.
Just one thing to do.

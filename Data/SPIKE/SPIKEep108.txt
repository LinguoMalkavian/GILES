Can we talk?
We have to talk.
Um, whatever. Just conversation. For instance, the weather, the... graves.. the -- We kissed, Buffy.
We kissed, you and me, all 'Gone with the Wind' with the rising music and the rising ... music, and what was that Buffy?
Don't you get all prim and proper on me. I know what kind of girl you really are.
Yeah. What do you want?
Take it easy. You'll get your kittens.
I just need a little time.
Fancy meeting you here.
You need to give me asylum.
No need to get cute. It's a disguise. Thrift shop number. Happens there's a bloke I'd rather not see just now. (to Buffy) You met him, I believe. The toothy bloke with the baby seal breath?
AAAaaa!
Nope.
Oh listen to Mary Poppins! Got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen are always so -- Bloody hell. Sodding blimy shagging knickers bullocks -- oh no. I'm English.
You don't suppose... you and I... we' re not related, are we?
Father! My god how I must hate you.
Oh, there's always something. And what's with the trollop?
I saw you... sleeping together.
Great, a tarty step-Mum who's half ol' Daddy's age.
Rupert.
'Made with care for Randy'. 'Randy' Giles?! Why didn't you just name me 'Horny Giles' or 'Desperate- for-a-shag Giles'? I knew there was a reason I hated you!
You never showed me affection like that. I'd wager.
Looks like 'Joan' fancies herself the boss.
Dad can drive. He's bound to have some classic mid-life crisis transport: something red, sporty, shaped like a penis.
Vampires!
Oh, I saw some...
Fine! Take the damn spikes!
Who, me?
Kittens?
That's your plan?
Right.
Ready Joan.
Right.
Hey! I'm a superhero, too?
Hey Joan, wait up!
Wait up!
Right. None of us do. And we're being chased by the fiendy--
How could you... I... me a vampire... Nah...
And I bite yours.
I'm a hero, really. I mean, to be cast such an ugly lot but then to rise above it, to seek better, nobler things. It's inspiring, in'it?
You know what you're doing?
Buffy... Buff--
From dust...
You'll get paid. I'm no welsher.
You alright?
We kissed, you and me, all 'Gone with the Wind' with the rising music and the rising ... music, and what was that Buffy?

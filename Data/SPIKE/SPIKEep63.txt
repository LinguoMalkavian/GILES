Uh-huh. And who are you, mate?
And how are "they" going to do that?
And "they" are .... the government? Nazis? A major cosmetics company?
The Slayer. I knew it. I KNEW IT!
She set me up, too!
Sorry, can't stay. Gotta go see a girl.
Aaah!!!
Bit busy just now ...
New plan: we split up.
It's me, baby, your man is...
I know, sugar, but you're forgetting one other thing I did. I missed you.
Never, my little foam latte. Your blondie bear is here to stay.
Forever and ever, mon petit creme brulee.
Uh, yeah. And get used to it. Big Daddy's home. We're gonna go wherever you want, do whatever you want, kill whoever you want. Starting with the slayer. And after that, it's all you and me, my little... ... mentholated pack of smokes.
Ow! No, see ... ow. The head, love, watch the head, watch ...
Hello, gorgeous.
I'll give you a choice: Now, I'm going to kill you. No choice in that. But ......
Bonus.
I don't understand. This sort of thing has never happened to me before.
I felt all right when we started. Let's try again. He suddenly lunges at Willow, mouth open.
Not to me, it doesn't!
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous. Why, I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
Thought about it.
Remember last year? You had on that fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath...
I hate being obvious. All fang-y and *grrr.* Takes all the mystery out.
If I could, yeah.
Don't patronize me.
I'm only a hundred and twenty-six.
Too weird.

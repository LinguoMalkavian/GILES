Now is not the time, you know it, I know it, making them understand - a totally different matter.
Fortunately ... you've got me.
Buffy.
I have.
Easy. If you think I like putting myself here, surrounded by people who don't particularly like me.
I'll be quick. We need to talk. Want to do that here, or privately?
I did. For a start and for the record - last you saw me, I was a mess - out of my head - admitted. Last week, living in the school basement ... well you saw me.
Now, in fairness to Buffy...
I didn't come to atone.
Only to help you.
I was kinda hoping you'd tell me. You're the Slayer. Connected to visions, the long line of worthies. Riqht? I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it: something's coming.
You're gonna need help.
I didn't. I'm just a guy who can lend a hand, if you let me. Ball's in your court, Slayer.
This thing came from underground, yes?
Comes when called?
Righty-o, then.
Yeah. What's your point, nibblet?
You're awfully quiet.
Fine with me. I was more than half expecting to get an earful anyway and when exactly'd your sister get unbelievably scary?
What? Told you once. Straight up. I'm here to help. And that's all. Think this here's our spot?
Don't fancy sticking my head in that.
You saw yourself. Those ghostly types down in the school basement got in my head. Made me flat-out, bug- shagging crazy. And I'm not exactly bragging about it, but they were ... stronger than I was. Made me see things. Do things.
Sorry to disappoint.
Hold the lantern closer, would you?
At the moment, I want a little more visibility. Fair?
It's not. Look. I can't blame you for being all skittish.
Neither do I. I can't say "sorry" and I can't use "forgive me." All I can tell you, Buffy, is I've changed.
Well, that's something.
You're right.
It's why we're here.
Please - I've already forgotten our little together time.
Didn't last.
Briefly.
Was a Sluggoth Demon. Am I right?
Sluggoth Demon. Very large, very nasty, natural predators who died out around the Crusades.
I'm not. Demon like yourself, Anya . Now you turn this spell around like a good little Vengeance Demon, or I ... what?
What are you staring at?
Right - let's go.
Nothing. Let's go. Got some worm hunting to do ...
Shut up.
Shut your mouth, you.
I said you shut UP!
Ooh, working out some issues, are we? Guess this'd be first contact since you-know-when ... up for another round in the balcony, then?
Is that it?!? A little touchy-feely and then you're off to the batpoles?
You've had you're turn, luv.
I'm sorry.
Right. Wrong. Wrong maneuver, not hardly helpful. Christ, please help me.
Too much pain and damage, up close, right inside me. All the way, deep, deep inside me ...
Get AWAY!
Oh, Lucky Girl. Call it quits, now there's an option. If only it were so easy, if only, if only and ... ... What the hell are you screaming about? I can hear you, no need to SHOUT!!!
I figured it out. Took awhile, yeah, but ... I think the real problem is ...
I think.
Yeah. I've been ... well come on, Let's face it, been a one-man slaughterhouse, last hundred years. Raping. Murdering. And for what? Kicks.
Buffy. I can't sleep. Can't think. There's voices and darkness and blindness and pain and help me, I I...
I do indeed.
You know why. I got my soul back ...
Buffy.
I have.

Ow!
Ow . Thought they were demons
Remind me not to help you.
A little sympathy for the man with the migraine, can we...
Yeah. You'd think if the government's gonna put a chip in my head, they'd at least make it so I could attack criminals and that sort.
There's other ways...
Buffy.
Wanna jump right to the kissing then, eh?
Twice.
You're a tease, Slayer. Know that? Get a fella's motor revvin', let the tension marinate a couple of days, then -bam! Crown yourself the Ice Queen.
Only a matter of time before you realize. I'm the only one here for you, pet! You got no one else!
Well, well, well, look who decided to show up.
You know, a man was frozen alive in there. Little compassion, love.
Buffy. I'm on everyone's case.
It did the other night.
And you seem awfully quick to forget about 'em.
But --
You know, I always wondered about you two.
Did it work?
You convince yourself?
A man can change.
Stop walking away --
Owww. Owwww.
Look at all the goodies.
That's right, you should scream.
She thinks I'm housebroken. She forgot who she was dealing with.
Just 'cause she's confused about where she fits in, I'm supposed to be, too? 'Cause I'm not.
Yes, I am. I'm a killer. That's what I do. I kill.
Knock, knock Robot-Boy. Need you to look at my chip.
In my head. The chip in my head.
You can play holodeck another time. Right now, I'm in charge.
Examine my chip or else Mr. --
What I want is answers, nimrod.
That right? Let's find out.
I'm not scratching your anything. You do what I say. That's the deal. Deal?
Then let's go.
Yeah.
Bloody hell, get on with it, then.
Well, there's gotta be something --
If you're lying to me --
You tell anyone about this --
It's about the rules having changed. Everything is different now.
There. All ready.
Now at last, Buffy, you will come to me, and your destiny wi -- wait.
Slayer.
Meet me at the cemetery. Twenty minutes. Come alone.
Bloody hell, yes, it's me.
Just be there.
Something like that, yeah. Kinda thought you might be up for a little grunt work.
I was talking shop, love. But if you've other ideas... You and me... Cozy little tomb with a view-
Slayer.
You never showed.
You shouldn't be so flip, love.
I'm just saying, things might be a little different now. You oughta be careful.
Or what?
Don't you get it? Don't you see?
No trick. It's not me. It's you.
Oh, poor little lost girl.
I'm in love with you.
Hello! Vampire! I'm supposed to be treading on the dark side.
I wasn't planning to hurt you. Much.
Afraid to give me the chance?

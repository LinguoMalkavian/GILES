Looking for me?
Oh. Right then, off you go...
The wedding. Two hearts united for eternity, great pelting showers of rice and so forth.
What? Families get outta hand, tear the place up?
Gotta say, din't see that coming.
That right?
Yeah, well. Some people can't see a good thing when they've got it. End up dumping the one thing they've got going for 'em--
Tell you what, Slayer. I'll get out of your way, stop bothering you.
Guess you know all 'bout that, doncha? King of the big exit. Heard it brought the house down.
Right. Wouldn't wanna listen to Spike. Might get a bit 'a truth on you.
More'n happy to beat you right through the pain, you pathetic Poof.
Here. Let's get her into my crypt.
Put a little ice on the back of her neck. She likes that.
So, she's having the wiggings, is she? Thinks none of us are real? Bloody self-centered if you ask me. Not to mention downright stupid.
On the other hand, could explain some things. This all being in that twisted brain of hers. Fix up some chip'n my head, make me soft so I'd fall in love with her, and then turn me into her sodden sex slave.
Nothing. Alternative realities, nitwit. Where we're all little figments of Buffy's funny farm delusion. In your case, her pathetic gofer figment.
You know, different reality, you might've not left your bride at the altar. Might've gone through with it like a man.
And what?
Oh, balls. You didn't say the thing was a Glarghk Guhl Kashma'nik.
I'll hang a bit. Keep an eye on the wax job.
How is she?
You all right?
Fine, then. But I hope you don't think this antidote's gonna rid you of that nasty martyrdom. See, I figured it out, luv. You can't help yourself. You're not drawn to the dark like I thought. You're addicted to the misery.
'Cause I'm done with it. You either tell your friends about us... or I will.

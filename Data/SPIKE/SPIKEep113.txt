Lucky for the bed.
No. It just looks different when you're under it.
Yeah?
Well if you want, I can- Are we having a conversation?
Well isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
You were amazing.
I was just trying to keep up. The things you do... the way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.
Want to see the bite marks?
And she's off.
What is this to you? This thing we have.
Do you even like me?
But you like what I do to you.
What would they think of you? If they found out all the things you've done.
Stop me.
Ow! Bloody hell, what did you do that for?
Buffy!
You tell me.
So you thought you'd just slip away, then? Vampire, remember? I could feel you.
Buffy - -
We have to go.
There's nothing you can do. We have to go before someone sees you.
We have to go! Now!
All right. Listen to me. Buffy. Buffy!
It was an accident.
I'm going to get you home.
I'm going to get you home. And you're going to crawl into your warm comfy bed and stay there. We'll sort this out. Trust me.
Shh... Don't worry. It'll be our secret...
Sorry, luv. Can't let you do that.
Nothing happened.
Demons in the woods? Time going wonky? They won't believe you.
Show them what?
I took care of it.
What I had to! I went back and took care of it. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever find her.
Ouh, balls.
There still isn't anything to connect this to you.
It wasn't your fault.
It was an accident. It just happened.
You're not doing this.
I can't. I love you.
You're not throwing your life away over this.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
And how many people are alive because of you? How many have you saved? One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
Buffy -
Why don't you explain it?
You always hurt... the one you love, pet.

No visitors today... terribly busy...
Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.
DON'T YOU THINK I'M TRYING?!? Ooh, not a fast, not a quick STUDY... I dropped my board in the water and the chalk all ran, sure to be caned... ...should've seen that coming...
Not in here, they'd not dare... no solicitation, thank you...
Not ghosts...
Manifest spirits, controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance... a four-year old could figure it...
THIS IS MY HOME! I belong here, I've always been here, cheers for stopping by.
Everything is... I had a speech, I learned it all... oh God, she won't understand... she won't understand...

What's the hurry, luv?
Didn't seem to take issue with it last night. Or with any of the other little nasties we whispered.
I just don't see why you have to run off so quick. I thought we could...
Don't say that.
Not exactly what I had in mind.
Make me.
Stay. I'm stuck here. Sun's up.
I knew. I knew - the only thing better than killing a slayer would be fuc-
Wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
Before you go voicing any more of your theories, you might do well to remember that I can hurt you now.
So, what? You go back to treating me like dirt until the next time you get an itch you can't scratch?
Bullocks. It was a bloody revelation. You can act as high and mighty as you like, but I know where you live now, Slayer. I tasted it.
Hardly. Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?
I may be dirt, but you're the one who wants to roll in it, slayer. You never had it so good as me. Never.
Yeah. And it made you scream, didn't it?
Right.
I'm a bit knackered. Had a long night. Someone should teach you how to use candles in foreplay, luv-
Again? You ever think of a Lojack for the girl? What's the story?
Willow... Kind of a sorry excuse to come 'round. You want the touch, all you need to do is-
Rack?
I know who he is. He deals in magic. Black stuff. Dangerous.
Because he cloaks it. You can't feel it unless you're into the big bad. A witch or a vampire or-
That's right. Hide your blushing eyes.
Not yet. Maybe I'd pick up on it if you stopped asking every two seconds.
What? So I can linger near your precious self? Get a grip-
Maybe. But we've been over this, haven't we? Things have changed.
Yeah. Me too.
No, it's your calling . Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.
Not yet. But I'm in your system now. You're going to crave me like I crave blood. And the next time you come calling, if you don't stop being such a bitch, maybe I will bite you.
Too late for that. You already invited me in. And as for work... you need me. Like tonight-
You really going to put your little sis in danger, just to spite me?
Dunno. Musta been sometime between the first time and the...

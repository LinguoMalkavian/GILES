Don't...
You should probably --
I don't remember anything.
No. Not that. I don't remember... what I did.
Flashes here and there. Like I'm watching someone else... do it. Kill people. I've been losing time for a while now. Waking up in strange places...
Wasn't aware that it had, you know. Not 'til now.
Things have been wonky for me ever since I got back. Ever since...
Figured that's what it was like. Been so long since I had it.
"Saw a man about a girl."
No. Not like that. There was a price. There were trials... torture. Pain. Suffering. Of sorts...
Well, s'all relative, innit?
Meaning I've come to redefine the words "pain" and "suffering" since I fell in love with you.
Apparently I've just slaughtered half of Sunnydale, pet. Not really worried about being polite anymore.
Feeling honest with myself. You used me.
You told me that, of course. Never understood, though. Not 'til now. You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.
Soul's not all about moonbeams and penny whistles, luv. It's about self-loathing I get it. Had to travel around the world, but I understand you now. I understand the violence inside.
Not the same. Bad as I was, as evil and as wretched as I was, I never truly hated myself back then. Not like I do now.
Well, we've got ourselves a problem.
" -- Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me, How could you use a poor maiden so -- "
What's that?
Oh, nobody. Just keeping myself company.
Fine, How are you?
I'm fine, Buffy. Really. Just feel a bit... peckish, I suppose.
Did I hurt anybody?
Who?
Ah.
I don't remember...
Buffy -- I don't know... why...
Kill me.
Buffy, you have to kill me.
Do you have any idea what I'm capable of?
I'm not talking about the cellar. The people in the cellar got off easy. I'm talking about me. See, you don't know me. You only met hamstrung-Angel-Spike. You only met conditioned-chip-Spike. You never met the real me.
You got off easy, too . Do you know how much blood you can drink from a girl before she'll die? I do. See, the trick is, if you drink just enough... if you damage them just enough ... you can keep them alive for weeks. You can make yourself a plaything.
I already did it. It's already done. Do you know what I used to do to girls Dawn's age?
Have you ever stopped to think about why you can't kill me? After everything I've done? To you. To the people around you. Have you ever wondered why you keep me alive? It's not love, we both know that.
Don't. Don't do that. Don't rationalize this into some noble act. You don't get to do that .
You need the pain we cause you. You need the violence inside. You need the hate . It gives you the strength to do what you have to do. To be the Slayer. But it's killing you.
You have to let it go.
There's no one else --
Window dressing.
-- It's window dressing --
-- I'm killing you --
Buffy!
You'll have to excuse the imagery...

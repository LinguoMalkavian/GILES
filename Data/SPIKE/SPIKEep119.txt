Doesn't hurt. (re: Dawn's backpack) Not planning a camp out, are we?
The birds are flying again, eh? Ain't love grand.
Yeah. Kinda picked up on that.
It's... complicated, nibblet.
Must be true then.
Buffy told you?
Wankers.
No. It was just... a bad day. For both of us. We had a few drinks and things just --
Oh, right. Big Sis was treating me so well up until then. Huh. Must still be a bit of the evil left in me after all.
We need to talk.
This isn't just about you -- as much you'd like it to be.
I'm sorry.
Because I care about you.
That's not... I didn't go to Anya for that. I was looking for a spell.
It wasn't for you. I wanted something -- anything to make this feeling stop. I just wanted it to stop. You should have let him kill me.
Why?
Because you love me.
Why do you keep lying to yourself?
Trust is for old marrieds, Buffy. Great love is wild and passionate and dangerous. It burns and consumes.
I know you feel like I do. You don't have to hide it anymore.
Let yourself feel it...
You love me...
Let it go... Let yourself love me...
(kissing, touching) I know you felt it... When I was inside you...
You're going to let me inside you...
You'll feel it again, Buffy...
I'll make you feel it...
Oh god. Buffy... I didn't --
What have I done? Why didn't I do it? What has she done to me?
We were never together. Not really. She wouldn't lower herself that far.
Why do I feel this way?
Is that what this is?
I can feel it. Squirming inside my head.
The chip. Little Jiminy Cricket, gnawing bits and chunks.
Everything used to be so clear. Slayer. Vampire. Vampire kills Slayer, sucks her dry, picks his teeth with her bones.
That's how it's always been. I've tasted the life of two Slayers. But with Buffy... This isn't the way it's supposed to be. It's the chip. Steel and wires and silicon. It won't let me be a monster. And I can't be a man. I'm nothing.
They do. (a beat) If you make them.
She thinks she knows me. She thinks she knows who I am. What I'm capable of. She has no idea. I wasn't always this way. It won't be easy, but I can be like I was. Before they castrated me. Before... Then she'll see who I really am.
Get nice and comfy Slayer. I'll be back. And when I do... it's all gonna change.

You're not The First! GILES You're not in pain!
Anya said you were The First. Said you were evil. You're supposed to be all, y'know, go-through-able!
I... huh... didn't think 'a that.
Yeah, well..
There was a choice...
You look nice.
Heard you got a date.
Buffy, I'm all right.
What? Be noble? I'm not. I really am all right. You think I still dream of a crypt for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.
Don't care for picket fences anyway. Bloody dangerous.
Right. There's always girls who like the look. Bad boy, you know, does it for some of 'em.
You tried to record the ultimate evil? Why? In a complex effort to royally piss it off?
Why'd it appear to... ...this one, then? Thought it was s'posed to be pulling my strings.
I can go get her--
I'll go get her--
I'll go get Buffy. She's gonna be worried about the boy.
It's Xander.
Willow did a locator spell. Useful stuff.
Buffy, he's got it floored.
Yes it is.
Let's go.
Anyone tell you about what happened 'round here tonight?
You got another demon fighter now. Son of a Slayer at that.
That right? Why's that then?
And the principal? How's he fit in?

Nice punch you got there.
Heard you were coming. Right. Bit of a misunderstanding here. I'm --
We have? I don't think--
So am I!
Well, yes.
Yeah. T'riffic.
No.
I'm nothing like Angel.
Angel's dull as a table lamp. And we have very different coloring.
Not all that tension was about you. Giles was part of a plan to kill me for Buffy's own good.
Teeth get yellow. Over an eternity. You gotta watch that.
Right. Not what it looks like-
I got dangerous for a while.
After. But I'm over it. In case you get feeling dust-happy again after your long incarceration.
Yeah. Gets a bit much up there.
So how come you're not up there imparting?
But you waited until Angel needed you to break out of jail.
What movie?
You had the power to walk away anytime. Nothing to stop you.
You over it?
What's the "less?"
Such as?
You could do better. School girl thing is old hat.
Join 'em.
I suspect that would be you.
Yeah. You made quite an impression on my chin.
Pity.
The body swap. With Buffy.
Told me it went down. Failed to mention who was driving her skin around.
Like you could ride me at a gallop until my legs buckled... Squeeze me 'til I popped like warm champagne? Not the sorta thing a man forgets.
You have been away.
Not of late.
Aren't you usually at work about now?
Could be that's what he wants you to do. Ol' bait and switch.
Like Falcon Crest...
Shouldn't be too hard...
We're leaving.

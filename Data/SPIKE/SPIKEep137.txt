You're really asking the wrong fella.
All jobs do.
Your outside's not so bad.
Preaching to the choir, love.
I like my plan better: get up, get out, get drunk. Repeat as needed. It's just more elegant.
Think nothing of.
Right. I'm just out for the alcohol.
You're on, then.
Aw, let it go, would you? You're like a dog with a bone.
It's my bone! Just drop it.
Know what?
Oh thank God.
Demon.
'Course he does.
After saving your life.
Yet here you are. Walking. Breathing. Annoying.
Anya, think: I fight. Demon-boy gets lucky, knocks me out - you get killed. True? We both know the safest and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you near me, away from danger.
Not a bit. And just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?
Fine by me. Big fight against evil coming. The more good guys we got, the longer we all live.
Haven't heard any complaints. Well, I've heard a few over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke up and that was pretty much that.
No, I'm not. But: That's the old me I'm talking about.
Not much to tell. I've changed.
Yeah. It was a big deal. Very private. Are you just telling everyone now? What are you spilling next, that I bleach my hair?
Right. The educator.
That case? Yeah. I went to great lengths, lot of trouble, and now I'm unique. Well, more or less. Got myself a soul. Whatever that means.
In progress.
Years.
Few.
Around.
Right. Getting the full tour.
Out. Since I'm neither a girl nor waiting, all this speechifying doesn't really apply to me, does it?
If you've got something to say...
I don't need to be here.
Holding back? You're blind. I've been here, right in it. Fighting. Scrapping.
Matter of fact. I'm just not relishing a kill the way I used to.
I did this for you! The soul, the changes - it's what you wanted.
Oh, you don't know how close you are to bringing him out.
Get her out of here. All of you, 'less you want to be all dead and useless.
What I do best.
Slayer's counting on you, Willow. Get cracking on the portal, and don't be stingy with the mojo. Demon's mine.
Just one thing I need.
Got a job.
New York.
Aw come on now, Nancy, you call yourself a Demon? Thought you were up for a proper fight.
Don't know your feelings, big guy, but to me, a tumble like that...

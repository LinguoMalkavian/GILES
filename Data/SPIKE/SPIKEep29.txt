I won't have you feeding me like a child, Dru!
No, we weren't.
Have you forgotten that you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?!
That's enough !
Dru! Pet? What is it?!
Are you insane?! We're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.
And what if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus. Because this new, improved one is definitely not playing with a full sack.
Hey, I love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke, but his hijinks will only serve to leave us with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer…
Ahn-ahhh… no fair going into the ring unless he tags you first.

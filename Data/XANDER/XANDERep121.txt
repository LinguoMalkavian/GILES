I think I'm gonna be sick.
I know, it's just - what happened back there, the sounds of it. The smell ...
Willow did that.
You don't think she's gonna kill them too? She wouldn't. There's no good reason.
Longer than what?
Right, Vengeance Demon. How could I... at least she'll get there first.
Anya can handle herself.
She's got to come down sometime, doesn't she? I mean back there she was out of her head - running on grief and Magicks.
Warren was a stone cold killer of women just getting warmed up. You ask me? Bastard had it coming.
This is still Willow we're dealing with, right?
Willow...
Sure, but how are you gonna...
Get in.
I don't see anything.
Boys? If you don't knock it off, I will pull this car over and you can just walk to your painful deaths from here.
Hate to admit it, Buff, but Jonathan may have a point. Why isn't she right here right now?
Guess we keep running, then.
Just Willow.
Well, this is faster...
She's what-ing?
Thanks, Anya. For getting here so fast. It's a big help.
Whatever. So? Can you still sense Willow?
Did I mention the me needing comfort ?
And I could smack you so hard your eyeballs switch sockets.
But she drained the place.
What is it?
Think you can work this stuff?
I'm thinking Willow's in a league of her own about now, dabble-boy.
Buffy, say this works. And we stop Willow from working the hoodoo for a minute. What then?
Great. And say what?
How am I supposed to read?
How's the translation coming? What have we got so far?
Great. Babylonian. Because you know, that's easy.
Hey now - play nice, fellas, or you'll break our concentration.
And Willow will make sure you two boneless chickens are skinless, too.
You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?
She won't.
We're her friends, Anya. Her family. She would never hurt us.
Guess you two finally have something in common
Again with the comfort. Look, we both know things might get ugly at Wiccapalooza. If it gets really bad --
I need to know if you're gonna turn on me.
Right, 'cause you varnishing the table with Spike -- how could that possibly have hurt? It may have chaffed ...
If that's what you need to do.
I'm not.
You think I don't know that? You think I'm the hero of this piece? I saw the gun. Before Warren even raised it, I saw it, and... I couldn't move. He shot two of my friends before I could even... You want me to know how useless I am? That it's my fault? Thanks. Already got the memo.
You want to hate me, you want to make me suffer for what I did to you -- fine. Do whatever you want. After we save Willow.
Don't.
I'm getting you out of here.
Buffy can handle her.
No - that's why we're leaving. Come on!
But...
I don't know.

Okay okay... I'm coming... I'm up...
Buffy?
Spike?
N-no. He's out. I think. Least he was when I got home.
I dunno. Creature of the night, Buff. He's out ... creaturing. Why? What's happened?
Why would a vampire lie about who sired him? What's that, some kinda status symbol for the undead -- My sire can beat up your sire?
You just don't want to.
Why not?
Didn't stop him from hurting you.
Is it? Or is that what Spike wants you to think?
Me? Can't. I'm objective guy. I don't really know. And neither do you.
Well, don't leave me hanging. Who?
From high school? You didn't tell me the vamp you dusted was Holden "Call Me 'Webs'" Webster. Nobody called him "Webs." Went to school with him for ten years, not once did anyone ever--
You see that? See how he reacted when you mentioned "Webs?" Cool as Cool Whip. What's up with that?
Whoa. By "we," you mean "me" and me's gotta go to work. I've got a big client meeting in a couple of hours.
C'mon, Anya. You said you'd do it on the phone.
Didn't mind being alone with him before.
Nothing. Look, we don't actually know that he's killed anyone. Y'know... Lately. Might all just be a mistake.
Y'know. Didn't occur to me to look. But thanks for the tip. Okay, you'll be safe out here. Plenty of sunlight to hide in.
We don't want him to know we suspect Anything.
Wouldn't be the first time.
No, no. You're not going out.
Buffy was very clear about the not- leaving-of you.
Okay, I'm gonna list the reasons that won't happen. One--
Knocked me out. He's been gone at least a half-hour.
And you believe him?
But it'll be fun. No wait, I mean it'll get us all killed.
So you want him around because...
It's too dangerous.

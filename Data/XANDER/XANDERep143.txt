No.
Guess so.
Hope we're in time.
Careful...
Is she breathing okay?
Wait. I'm not to the "got it" place yet. I'm still in the neighborhood of "you've got to be kidding."
I don't... Buffy, do you get that, if I do this, that's it for me for this fight? I feel like you're putting me out to pasture.
Oh, you know, it's like... when a cow gets old and loses an eye or its ability to be milked, the farmer takes it and puts it in a different pasture where it won't have to... Fight... with priests... You don't have to protect me.
I got hurt. But I'm not done. I can still fight.
I just... always thought I'd be here for the end with you.
Not that this is the end.
No no no no. I meant "end" in a heroic, uplifting, way. I'm still optimistic! You're just thrown off by this gritty looking eyepatch.
I should be at your side. That's all I'm saying.
Okay.
Hey --
I didn't say you're gonna die. I I... implied you're gonna die. Totally different.
Besides... If you die I'll just bring you back to life. That's what I do.
Did you know I have to take a driver's test every year now?
No. Because of my eye. It's a whole state law. They don't trust my depth perception anymore.
You know what's even worse? All the stupid "It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye" jokes. "I guess the fun and games are over, eh Xander?"
That's not the point! It's an obvious joke. It'd be like if someone called me a cyclops.
I mean, give me an "eye of the beholder" joke or an "eye for an eye" joke or maybe even a weird postmodern "I, Claudius" joke. It's about standards, Dawn.
Just be creative.
Dawn. You awake?
Um... thought you might say that.
It was chloroform.
Chloroform . Are you still loopy?
Away.
Open it.
No.
Guess so.
Hope we're in time.

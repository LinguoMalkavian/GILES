Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
Honey? Slugs get turned off by slug. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
The party. Or, Tara. At the party.
It's just, Buffy really wants her there, seems important to her, and I told her I would ask you.
You'll be okay with it?
Anything new about Warren and the Nerd Herd?
Man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding. Upside of spending all that time shoved inside a locker. Not that I would know.
I'd go with you, but I've gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew before tomorrow morning.
Anya's making hors d'oeuvres.
Who's coming, you invite anyone else?
Don't worry about it. We're all over the new friend thing.
It's not a set-up.
Ahn.
Maybe we should start getting this stuff out there, people will be here soon.

Well... you've been a little busy lately.
But Willow...?
That's great! In a very bad way.
It looks pretty bad.
You're just a little freaked out is all, it'll pass.
Ahn.
We are. We will. We've been through worse.
Ahn. Ahn, stop, stop.
I don't know. Lemme get you some water, we'll cool you down, it'll be a start, all right? Some cold water?
Shhh, it's okay, I'm okay. I'm right here, see? Shhh.
Will. I don't wanna gang up on you, but... I kind of get Anya's point.
Honey, hey, honey, come on, this isn't the way, just calm down.
Anh, if you just stop for a second
Anya!
News from the file marked "duh." We're gonna get him to the ER.

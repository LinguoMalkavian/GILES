You think she'll get the sign?
I used yellow crayon. It's a thing. From when I talked to her on the bluff. I hope she gets it.
Well, I was talking from my heart, and I knew evil Willow wasn't really-- You were kidding.
I saved the world with talking! From my mouth. My mouth saved the world.
I'm going to say "Hi Willow."
That wasn't really her. And Giles wouldn't let her leave if she didn't finish that, whatever, recovery course.
What is it? Did Giles say something?
Guys. I've just noticed something...
Everyone's off the plane So... where's Willow?
So she got out in Chicago when they stopped?
I avoided Giles tons of times and it just meant I was lazy, not evil.
Willow? That you?
Is he throwing a tasteful British wiggins?
Like she didn't think we were ready to forgive her. I get that.
Tough to look at.
I found it first thing this morning. I gave my crew the day off, called you right away.
Yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking. Maybe Willow is back.
Can I take it back?
Saying it's her. Buffy, I can't let it be her. Because that would mean... what would it mean?
I don't want that. I don't want us to lose her. I don't want her to be lost.
You can't use the blueprints to find your way around, down here. Seems like the walls move or something...
We're here for a reason, Spike.
He knows. He must have seen the body.
Did you hear anything or see anything?
Boy, he's extra useful today...
And that means something because he's chock-full-o-sanity.
"Her boy"? I'm "her boy"?
It means nothing. Right? He mentioned Willow and it means nothing.
Wait. We are considering tadpoles?
Spike may have gone to the land of the twirly hand gesture next to the temple, but he was right. Everybody likes skin.
Just skin.
What's up?
In your viscera .
She is all right.
We didn't find any strips of skin. Which, by the way, ghhhuh.
Bleah gukguk yeee.
You're terrifying.
We could ask around at Willy's Place--
What?
What? How? What's going on?
We should've put him on a leash.
Really think it's working?
Oof.
Hey, Buffy, give him a break. Maybe it's a vicious skin-eating rock cliff.
I guess Buffy goes in first.
That's why I figure, Slayer goes first.
Dark and dank. I was hoping it would be dark and dank--
I don't... yeah. Now I do.
Yep.
Where'd he go?
You couldn't help it. It had paralyzing fingernails.
Heffel?
There's no need to be embarrassed.
She's right Face up is better.
It's going to be all right. We'll get you fixed up. You'll be doing the limbo in no time.
No, not as the pole. I promise.
We can't leave her alone like this. What if she vomits?
Right! She'll love to be called for vomit watch.
Paralyzed how ? In the not moving way.
Oh! You're posable!
Anya! You've got to keep up!
What? Where?
There's nothing here.
Because we haven't seen her.
He's too fast!
Where is she? Is she alive?
I think she's sort of... here-ish.
What's happening?
We're not going away. Oh, god.

You wanna keep breathing, you better keep moving.
Hey, you're not going anywhere. We're just gonna hide you two until we get the "all clear" from Buffy.
You do what I say--
Whoa, whoa. Okay, Andy, let's put the sword down.
You're not gonna die.
Like the way I handled that? Letting Jonathan save my neck so he can feel good about himself?
I have no idea.
I don't know, okay? I can't even run away well. And that's something I'm usually good at.
Oh, yeah. 'Cause I've been such a big help already. Standing around like a monkey while Buffy gets shot. Tara gets killed... And Willow... Losing her...
Sure, if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister.
Forget it.
Fine.
Is this blind spot a genetic trait with you Summers women? The only useful thing that animal ever did was finally leave town.
Man, they've really tightened up security around here. One too many squatters from the Hellmouth.
Yeah I'm working on a whole shut the hell up pitch I think you'll like too.
I've had just about as much as I can stand baby-sitting a coupla social retards who don't appreciate--
What?
Buffy, you know? Where's Dawn?
Naw. They musta skedaddled while I was out. Weasels. Whoa--
Right. Okay. I'll... take a look around.
Hey, black-eyed girl...
You're not the only one with powers, you know. You may be a hopped up uber-witch, but this carpenter can dry-wall you into the next century.
Yeah, I get that. It's just - where else am I going to go? You've been my best friend my whole life. World gonna end - where else would I want to be?
Well, I was going to walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but it seemed kinda cartoony.
I'm not joking. I know you're in pain. I can't imagine the pain you're in. I know you're about to do something apocalyptically evil and stupid and hey, still want to hang. You're Willow.
First day of kindergarten you cried 'cause you broke the yellow crayon and you were too afraid to tell anyone. You've come pretty far, ending the world, not a terrific notion but the thing is, yeah. I love you. I loved crayon-breaky Willow and I love scary veiny Willow. So if I'm going out, it's here. You wanna kill the world you start with me. I've earned that.
It doesn't matter. I'll still love you.
I love you.
I love you, Willow.
I love you.

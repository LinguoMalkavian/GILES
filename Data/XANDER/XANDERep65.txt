Jeez. You mean Oz just sent for his stuff and didn't even call her? That's pretty harsh.
That's sweet. God. Poor Willow. No wonder she's... having a wonderful time.
I believe that is the dance of a brave little toaster.
Nice to see you brought your boogie shoes tonight, Will.
Will, not loving the drowning of the sorrows.
Sadly - without the fuzzy bikini.
Right. Helping now. (moves to Willow) How's about you give me the beer.
We've all got pain, Will-
You know, Will, it's not like she could just let Spike go...
Buffy's gotta find out what's up with those commandoes. Right now she needs Spike!
Will. I know it's hard to see I right now. But everything you're feeling is 'cause of you and Oz. Not 'cause of Buffy or me or anybody. But, eventually you'll meet someone else and it'll be better.
We're not doomed.
Hey, I was just trying to help.
That's okay, Mom... we don't need any more snacks!
Shush. I thought she'd never clear out. Besides, just think of my lips as the fruit roll-ups of love. Okay that was gross. I'm a little distracted. Willow was really upset. I shouldn't've let her go away mad.
What the hell is going on?
Board up the windows! Barricade the doors!
I think we lost them. I didn't see -
How? What? How?
(off the kiss, to Giles) Can I be blind too? Wait. Married. I know something. What is it? This is all so familiar. Work, brain, work. Oh! Oh-oh! Willow!
Something about Willow and her grief-y poor-me mood swings. So, so tired of it.
She told me I was a demon magnet. And.. And she said you two should get married.
Yeah. Right. You're marrying Spike because you're so right for each other.
We've gotta find her -
Why does he have to come?
Please skip ahead.
Hey! Demon!
We're not doing well here...
Little help here!
(to Giles) Time?

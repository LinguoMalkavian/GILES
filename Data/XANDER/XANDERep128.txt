You're gonna live in that small room over there, I know it looks like a closet, but it's a room now, and you're not gonna touch my food, and I shower first in the morning, if I use up all the hot water, that's your tough noogies, and I hate this plan.
Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan?
I just don't understand when his problems became your problems. Or, more specifically, mine.
Why not? Crazy-basement-guy is better than stalking-Buffy-guy.
I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.
Things a lot better, I see.
Right. With the wailing and the crying. Still better than a cozy evening with Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
Remember when she had a crush on me? I miss the much cuter me crush.
Now, now. Let's not be hasty- Not the time for... Right.
It's the jacket.
No, Spike definitely seems a little more cogent, less...
Buff?
He don't seem so tough.
Hmmm. Daddy like.
Oh. Oh! No. Daddy - no! I wasn't... When I was looking, I wasn't... Oh, God.
What's wrong?
I just called him that guy in the jacket.
Dawnie? Honey? You seem... extraordinarily perturbed. Maybe I should go get Buffy --
I thought this was about the guy in, uh, that guy with the thing.
Buffy, I think Dawn needs yaaaahhh!
I'm sorry, it's just, checkout time was an hour ago, we were hoping to make up the bed, and, also, this is a classroom, you chowderhead.
Listen, you're under a love spell. That's what this has to be. Real love wouldn't make you this irrational. At least, not this fast.
We'll be working.
At least the yelling went away. It was starting to sound like Christmas morning with my family.
Hey, been there.
Family stuff... Hey, I knew his brother. He was a big jock at Sunnydale High, too. Couple years ahead of us. Used to stick chewing gum in my hair. Huh.
I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but maybe he's a way in.
I'm just saying, we're tangling with a powerful spell here, and we don't know what the deal is, so keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy...
Fine. Just be ready. And don't let this guy charm you either. He had everyone around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.
Yeah.
Good. Just, I know a girl who might be going out with him and I was wondering...
Yeah, I gather R.J.'s pretty popular too.
And do you have an idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a--
So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?
Wow, that's wonderful. But it's getting late...
We really gotta go.
Guys! Turns out it really is the jacket and R.J. doesn't even realize what he's got... hello? Hello?
Where is everybody?
What the hell are you doing?
Will? Honey? R.J.'s a guy.
What? You're gonna take off his--
Much time before what?
And how would they do that, exactly?
Fine! Okay! Let's start there!
Hey, crazy women. Look.
No!
You're sure you understand the plan?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it didn't fit.
He was pissed, but I don't think he got that the jacket was dosed with magic. Gonna be a rude awakening.
True. You fell for a mystical, ancient curse. Who here hasn't made that mistake... seven, eight times?

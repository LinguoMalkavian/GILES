"Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!"
Merciful Zeus.
It's a film.
Especially the ninth time.
It was very disturbing.
But disturbing. And not the natural order of things and do you think it'll happen again? 'Cause I'm for the natural order of things.
Well, we've just gotta break it down, look at the factors, before it happens again --
I'VE GOT A THEORY WE SHOULD WORK THIS OUT
IT COULD BE WITCHES SOME EVIL WITCHES
See okay that was disturbing.
So, what'd you sing about?
The what now?
I bet they're not even working.
Willow and Tara. You see the way they were with each other? The get-a- roominess of them. I'll bet they're -- (seeing Dawn) -- singing. They're probably singing right now.
Oh yeah.
You want some breakfast, baby?
I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around, I don't think I could deal. It's a flab thing. So. Waffles?
No I'll only make them for myself, but by California law you will own half of them.
SHE IS THE ONE, SHE'S SUCH WONDERFUL FUN SUCH PASSION AND GRACE WARM IN THE NIGHT WHEN I'M RIGHT IN HER TIGHT --EMBRACE, TIGHT EMBRACE
SHE WHEEZES
SHE EATS THESE SKEEZY CHEESES THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT 'PLEASE' IS
LIKE SHE THINKS I'M ORDINARY
LIKE HER TOES ARE KIND OF HAIRY
SHE CLINGS -- SHE'S NEEDY SHE'S ALSO REALLY GREEDY SHE NEVER --
THIS IS MY VERSE, HELLO SHE --
YOU'RE QUITE THE CHARMER
YOU'RE THE CUTEST OF THE SCOOBIES WITH YOUR LIPS AS RED AS RUBIES AND YOUR FIRM YET SUPPLE -- TIGHT EMBRACE...
SHE'S SWELLER
THAT'S WHY I'LL NEVER TELL HER THAT I'M PETRIFIED
IS SHE LOOKING FOR A POT OF GOLD
WILL OUR LIVES BECOME TOO STRESSFUL IF I'M NEVER THAT SUCCESSFUL
AM I CRAZY
AM I MARRYING A DEMON
MY LIPS ARE SEALED
NOTHING TO SEE MOVE IT ALONG
It's a nightmare. It's a plague!
It's like a nightmare about a plague --
It was just like, I didn't wanna be saying things but they just kept pouring out of me and they rhymed and they were mean and My eyes are not beady! ANYA I felt like we were being watched, like a wall was missing from our apartment, like there only three walls, no forth wall and My toes are not hairy!
Giles, you gotta stop it.
Work with me, british man. Give me an axe and show me where to point it.
As in, burnt up? Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
But we're sure the two things are related? Singing and dancing and burning and dying?
She's easing back in. We brought her back from an untold hell dimension, remember? Ergo, weirdness. The important thing is that you're there for her.
Plan, shman, let's mount up!
Spikey sang a widdle song?
Let it go, sweetie.
WHAT IF BUFFY CAN'T DEFEAT IT
I didn't know what was gonna happen! I just heard, you know, revelries and song and... I wanted to be sure we'd work out. Get a happy ending.
Does this mean I have to... be your queen?

Hi. I'm back.
I know. I tried calling. But I couldn't talk without..
I'm sorry. For disappearing. For walking out like that.
Right. Is she here?
I need to. Her suitcase was gone, some of her stuff. The Magic Box has a 'closed' sign, which, like, chills me to the bone--
Was she looking for me? Before she left, did she say anything?
Oh, God... I didn't mean... I don't know how this got so mixed up. I blew it.
No! I mean, it wasn't about breaking up. I love her. And god, I miss her so much. Driving out of town, I kept turning to ask her if it was gonna be okay, and each time... she wasn't there.
I guess. I know my life is better with her in it. It got all complicated with the wedding. With my family, and her... demons And what if it all goes to hell? And forever. But then I left, and ever since, it's been like there's this painful hole inside... and I'm the idiot that dug it out.
Should'a known you'd be tagging along.
Why don't you do that, Spike? Run along.
You can't, I don't wanna hear this crap from you.
Oh hey, guess what, I forgot Willy Wannabite can't hurt me. Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.
What happened?
Spike, just -- go. She's our friend, we'll take care of her.
And when you say poke --
Come on! That's ridiculous! What, you think this isn't real just 'cause of all the vampires and the demons and the ex- Vengeance demons and the sister that used to be a ball of universe- destroying energy?
Spike, we need muscle here, not color commentary.
What?
Shut up.
One more syllable about Anya or realities or figments and --
You know, things really weren't this strange before Buffy showed. I mean, regular people, they don't know about demons.
That's 'cause I can't say Glarma --
Hold it. Hold it...
Thank you, Spike. I'll help as soon as the blitzing pain subsides.
YI-AWGH!!
Make sure that's all you're ogglin'.
Hello? I'm back. Clean and with the better smell now.
Hey there, sane girl.
Great. Then it's settled, we're real. Right? Guess we'll have to finish off that demon and drag it out of the basement and tell me you're up for that. I so don't wanna see Spike right now. Talk about losing touch. I hate to say it, but I almost worry about him. Almost. The things the poor guy was saying...
Willow? What...
Buffy?
Buffy, help me!! I need my hands!!
Buffy! HELP!!
We're okay. Everything's okay.

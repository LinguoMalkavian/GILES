Wendell, what's wrong with you? Don't you know she's the center of the universe... the rest of us merely revolve around her.
Wendell was in Cordelia's light.
Hey guys. Was there any homework?
Cool. What's active listening?
(remembers the sweater and what was in it) The midnight blue Angora. (to them) See, I was listening.
We have?
Oh. The spiders. Willow's been kinda... what's the word I'm looking for... insane about what happened yesterday.
I'm sorry, I'm unruffled on spiders. Now if a bunch of Nazis crawled across my face...
Hellmouth, center of mystical convergence, supernatural monster. Been there.
I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there, we'll find, you'll slay, we'll party.
Well, you da man, Buff.
Well, did you find any theories on spiders coming out of books? Big crawly hairy...
It was funny if you're me.
Good talkin' to ya', man.
There's nothing to say. You saw two hundred insects, you Gonzoed. Anybody would have -
They're from the Middle East?
It is platonic, right?
That's how it happens. Every time?
Which is a fair wiggins, I admit. But do you think that ties in with Laura?
I don't know. It's kind of a big leap. It could just be coincidence. - Wendell finds a spider's nest, we all wig 'cause he dreamed about spiders.
It doesn't mean they're connected...
I don't know, I... was dressed a minute ago... this is a dream. It's gotta be a... Ow! Wake up... (pinches himself again) Ow! Gotta wake up...
AHHHHHHHH!
Red alert. Where' s Buffy?
Oh don't I wish I had an answer to that question.
Except my underwear.
Bad thing? I was nude! Bad thing doesn't cover it.
With nudity! It's a total nightmare.
Except for the part with me waking up going "it was all a dream..." It happened.
Our dreams our coming true?
Okay, despite the rat-like chill that just crawled up my spine, I'm going to say this very calmly: Hellllp....
Well, that explanation was shorter than usual. It's Billy. Who's Billy?
And he brought the nightmare world with him Thanks a bunch, Billy.
Well, we've got to stop it.
Probably be faster if we spilt up to look for her.
Weird how everyone seems to have disappeared... ... all right!
Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness.
My lucky day...
I ruv dese bars...
A Chocolate Hurricane! These are the best! I haven't had one of these since my... sixth... birthday...
Did you find Buffy?
(urging her out) Willow, come on. We gotta find the others.
Remember my sixth birthday party?
Come on!
You were a lousy clown! And your balloon animals were crap! Everyone can make the giraffe.
I feel good, I feel liberated.
What do we do?
And when did they make it night over there?
Okay, whose nightmare is this?
That was a joke, right?
What now?
I get it...
Hey, he's waking up.
Not if you played Kiddie League. I'm surprised it wasn't one of the Parents.
Hey, I just did what anybody would have... if people want to label it heroic -
Shoot.
Willow. Who can you - I mean that's really bent, she was grotesque.
I'm sick. I need help.

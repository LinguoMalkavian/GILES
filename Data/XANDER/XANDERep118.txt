Oh my God.
How are you?
Ahn. Please. Let me --
But you have to believe me, please, that I want to make up for it, I want to take away the hurt, I love you. So much.
I do. I'm an idiot.
No, no, I mean, you know, if I had been more, like, self-aware.
I don't mean it like that, it's more like...
Ahn, it's a very complicated question.
Someday, yes, very much.
Okay, clearly I'm not handling this well.
All I want is for us to be together. I love you. I just wish we could go back to the way things were before.
I know this is all coming out wrong.
I know, honey. I totally deserve that.
They are.
God, yes. It hurts so bad it's killing me. Anya, I love you. I want to make this work.
It's not you, honey. It's me. I'm the one that --
Ahn, wait. Please...
Anya, wait...
What are you doing? I have to go after her.
That's not Proactive Guy. That's Sit- Around-And-Wait-For-The-Rest-of-His- Life-To-Turn-To-Crap Guy.
So I'm just supposed to what? Walk away? That shouldn't be too hard. It's what I'm good at, isn't it?
Buffy.
(re: the front door) Looks like someone's been keeping an eye on all your ins and outs.
Okay, well, let's see. Who's obsessed with Buffy? Who likes to hang out here in the yard and keep an eye on her? Who's the guy in love with you but not getting any?
If it's not Spike, and I'm not saying I believe him, but if it's not Spike, I think we already know who's behind this.
Nerds.
Oh, God.
I -- what is she -- ?
Get up. Get up!
Too bad.
Don't even try to deny it. 'Cause we saw it all. The whole, beautiful show.
(ignoring them) O-oh! Okay... then you had to do it. Because he was there. Like Mt. Everest. Like I used to be.
So you bang the first body you can find? Dead or alive?
When this is your solution to our problems? I hurt you so you get me back? Very mature.
I'm not joking now. You let that evil, soulless thing touch you. You wanted me to feel something, congratulations. It worked.
Shut up. Leave her out of...
I don't want to know this, I don't want to know any of this.

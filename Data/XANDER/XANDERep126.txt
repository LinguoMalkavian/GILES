Hey!
Thirty-three minutes. Since when did we go to all this effort for one lousy vampire, make that one lousy potential vampire?
No, no, I'm sorry. I want to help. I guess I'm a bit stressed out these days. Sorry to take it out on you.
I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. You're perfect for this job.
I dunno, amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean, like natural causes dead.
Maybe she cut herself shaving. And then died, naturally, of embarrassment.
I bet she's giving them great advice.
"From beneath you it devours."
I think you will.
I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail.
So you choke up, then you have control, but no power. It could take ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control; it's a trade-off.
Right. Ouch.
You are, I mean it'll take time.
So, the question is, what changed?
Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. I'm not saying you don't have Slayer Grace? But it's not the first time.
Strep throat, ear infections, yeast infection, none of my business. No real info here.
Willow! She's seventeen!
A day and a half of researching and we finally try looking up her .
Poems. Always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
Okay... Death really is on her brain.
But this girl isn't just dealing. She's giving death a long sloppy word kiss. She has a yen for the big dirt nap.
Love poems?
Love poems.
A violent drunk?
And Buffy the counselor?
You tell us.
He looked at me. He just said "wife" and looked at me.
Yeah, you look real busy--
Are you talking about... killing yourself?
She was going to die no matter what, wasn't she? No matter what you did.

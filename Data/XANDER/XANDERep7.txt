Sorry. I was just --
Oh, you saw that. Well, thanks for being so understanding and -- I don't know what everyone's talking about, that outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker.
Boy that Cordelia's a regular breath of vile air -- what are you vixens up to?
Whoah, stop this crazy whirlygig of fun. I'm dizzy.
Yeah, it's early! We could, um, dance.
In your room? In your bed?!
That is the moral decline that's eating our country out of house You know what I mean.
Oh come on, Buffy, wake up and smell the seduction, it's the oldest trick in the book.
Duh. Guys'll do anything to impress a girl. I once drank an entire gallon of Gatorade without taking WILLOW It was pretty impressive. Although later on there was an ick factor --
Buff, you better stay at my place until these Samurai-guys are history. Don't worry about Angel. Willow can run over to your house and tell him to get out of town fast.
And what if he doesn't take their lives?
All right, you have a problem and it's not a small one. Let's just take a breath and look at this calmly and objectively.
Angel's a vampire, you're a Slayer -- it's obvious what you have to do.
I know you have feelings but it's not like you're in love with him or anything, right?
You're in love with a vampire?! Are you out of your mind?
Not vampire, I mean . . . How can you love an umpire? Everybody hates them!
Yup.
Again I say, yup.
Buffy? Why would Buffy be bothering me?
It's just . . . this guy Angel, the research is in, he's a vampire -- still she likes him better than me.
Love sucks. Ever since I was in grammar school it's the same old dance . . . you dig someone, they dig someone else. And then that someone else digs someone else.
I mean, I'm right for her. I'm the guy. I know it. She's so stupid! She's not stupid. But . . . it's too much. We're such good buds, I'm this close to her, and she doesn't have a clue how I feel. And wouldn't care if she did. It's killing me.
Can you please warn us before you do that?
I'm not saying anything, I have nothing to say.
Now I'm saying something. You saw him naked ?
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
Question, the hundred years or so before he came to our shores, what was he like then?
Hey, Buffy, we -- Oh my god.
Buff, this isn't your fault.
We'll keep an eye on your mom.
Why do they call it tweed?
Okay, here's a question. Say we find her. Say she's fighting Angel or some of his friends. What the heck are we going to do about it ?
You couldn't just give her a cell phone for Christmas, could you.
Did you just hear --
We need to distract her.
Good, enough distraction!
I don't think we can save her with Disco Fever . . . Oooo, strobes . . .
Ah, the post-fumigation party.
Much heartier cockroaches.
I don't need to watch because I'm not threatened. I'm gonna look this way.
What's going on?
Well, as long as they're not kissing . . .

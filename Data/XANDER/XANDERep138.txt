Hey.
Yeah? The heart?
But it is kind of a shame you keep saving the world and there's not any proof.
I like that one.
Whoa. What the hell?
I've apologized enough. That's what I have to say.
Well, yes.
It was the right thing to do.
Look Anya . If I'd married you, it would've always been against what I thought was best. It wouldn't have worked!
I don't mean to. Anyway, you were the one who didn't want to keep seeing each other.
Of course I still love you. I always will. I just don't know if that means anything for us anymore.
Well, it's nice to hear.
I'm right here.
We could've kept that. I just wasn't ready for marriage, that's all. I didn't want to, you know, get evicted from your head.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Anya.
You need anything from me... I'm right here.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Anya.
You need anything from me... I'm right here.
You were the first person to uncover it and feed it blood. How did you even know it was there? How did you know to do that?
You put your old murder weapon in with our stuff?
Well.
That was nice.
Too bad Buffy took Spike's chains down.
I felt good.
It was different.
Yeah. There wasn't that... I don't know...
Right.
Does this mean we're really over?
Not yet. I don't want it to be over yet. Can't you stay a little longer?
Yeah. Pretend that exact thing. Just for a little while.

Are you kidding?
Willow, I love you, but bye.
Buffy, wait up!
Guess who.
Well, yeah, but keep guessing anyway.
I can't fool you. You see right through my petty charade. Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
Malcolm, huh? That's right, I heard. Okay, but you're missing out. I'm planning to be witty. I'll be making fun of all the people who won't talk to me.
Color in the cheeks, a bounce in the step -- I don't like it. It isn't healthy. So what about you? Bronze? No, you probably have to slay vampires or some lame endeavor like that. Everybody deserts me.
What are you talking about?
Of what?
That's meaningless drivel. I'm not interested in Willow like that.
No, it's just... this Malcolm guy. What's his deal? Admit that it wigs you slightly.
How about who he really is? Oh sure, he says he's a high school student. I could say I was a high school student.
Okay, but I could also say I was an elderly Dutch woman, get me? Who's to say I'm not? If I'm in the elderly Dutch chat room --
You know, you read about these things all the time. Two people meet on the net, they talk, they get together, dinner, a show, horrible axe murder...
I know, but isn't it fun?
Calax Research and Development. Computer research lab. Third biggest employer in Sunnydale, till it closed last year. What, I can't have information sometimes?
Well, my uncle used to work there. In a floor-sweeping capacity.
Uh-huh.
If CRD re-opened it'd be in the news.
Duck.
I'm free tonight.
To read is makes our speaking English good.
I panicked, okay?
I'm gonna kill Dave.
Warn you that he set you up! Is she gonna be okay?
It's great. It's your best hair ever.
Care to share?
I knew that one.
Wow, that's really boring.
You released Moloch!?
If he's so big and strong, why bother with Dave? Why didn't he just attack Buffy himself?
And that released the demon.
Okay, for those of us in our studio audience who are me, you guys are saying that Moloch is in this computer.
So what do we do?
Don't get too close.
What are you thinking?
Are we over-reacting? This guy's in a computer, what can he do?
Okay, he's a threat. I'm on board with that now. What do we do?
What does he want with Willow?
No answer.
Well, it's not busy either, so she's not on line.
She's not home.
Willow isn't --
This is really real, huh.
With a little help from my friends?
That's not good...
Okay, any thoughts?
What about CRD?
I'm guessing that's Moloch central.
This place is pretty heavily secured. How do we get in?
I'll work on the sneaking.
Back way?
Buffy...
Yeah. Who's the other guy?
Then let's find another way in --
What's going on?
Whoops.
I got to hit someone!
Let's go this way!
So we're going to the Bronze tonight? We three?
Willow? Fun? Remember fun? The thing when you smile?
Right! And the teacher I had a crush on: giant praying mantis.
It's life on the Hellmouth.
We're doomed!

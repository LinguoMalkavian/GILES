Can I help? You seem kinda confused.
Confused but sort of randomly observant.
Oh, right. No, just helpful. I'm Xander.
That depends what you need it for. Something, like, functional around the house, or you know, recreational? (catching himself) By which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing, not tying someone up for funky sexy fun...
And again with the random. I like it.
Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Want to go bowling with me tonight?
Oh, you're the only one who gets to be random?
Guys! Guess what happened?
No! I did! Fine. Way to steal my thunder.
Also, like, ten years older than you, right?
Well she's interested in me, so there's a good chance. But I'm hoping for the best. We're going bowling and she has a kayak. Hey, that's a lot of socks.
That's gotta be rough, getting just, like, pulled outta your home, told you're a Potential Slayer, no chance to bring anything...
Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why look for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.
Maya, hi! I was afraid you weren't coming.
Well, it would be kinda karmic.
Forget it. I'm glad you're here. You wanna get a lane?
You don't bowl.
Will you be pointing at or mocking me at any point?
Then I'm in.
Yeah. But I guess that's good.
Well, it's on her mind right now, I think, because our anniversary just happened. I mean it would've been our anniversary. And maybe I shouldn't be allowed to forget it. I did... It was a bad thing. It hurt her a lot.
I guess not.
Never mind. We're good. I should've taken you on a nicer date than this.
I knew it. See, I knew it.
Yeah. That would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?
The Slayer.
Forget it. Are you affiliated with Vengeance Demons?
Competitive witches?
Did you hatch out of a praying mantis egg in the old high school?
This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women are attracted to me!
Yes.
Look, I've... I know what happens if that Seal down there gets all excited. I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into.
Well, then, you do understand, but what makes you think that's, like, a good idea?
Buffy?
So how's your date going?
What do you think happened? Another demon woman was attracted to me! But I've got the answer! Willow! Gay me up! C'mon! Let's gay!
You heard me. Tell me what to do. I'm mentally undressing Scott Bakula, that's a start, right?
C'mon Willow, let's get this gay show on the gay road. Help me out here!
I'll need stylish new clothes...

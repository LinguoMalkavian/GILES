Is she dying?
To a telephone, in Urdu… now that’s entertainment. Why is she singing?
Uh huh. And why is she singing ?
And we thought just ‘cause we didn’t have any money or anywhere to go this’d be a lackluster evening.
Hop off that outlaw train, Will, before you land us all in jail.
What’s like a relationship?
Huh?
Cor, you datin’ a college guy now?
Oh, an extra-terrestrial, so that’s how you get a date once you’ve exhausted all the human guys.
Wow, what a long day.
Yeah, and of course they flew by. Buffy!
Works for me.
Okay so tonight, Channel fifty nine, Indian T.V. – sex, lies and incomprehensible story lines – I’ll bring the beetle nuts.
Hey, I believe we were hanging here…
She’s gonna walk away… now. Okay boots, start walkin’…
I hate these guys. Whatever they want just falls into their laps. Don’t you hate these guys?
I’m elated.
Cordelia’s much better for you than Angel.
Bummer.
Don’t you hate that.
That bastard!
Yeah, Tom – who’s Tom?
Oh, I don’t think so, Buffy, frying pan and the fire, know what I’m saying?
The blood. There’s a guy you want to party with.
She should probably make the rounds again tonight while we try and figure out who that bracelet belongs to.
Buff, this is a little more important than –
I’m not going to say it ‘cause –
-- she will.
Like a corn dog.
Enh! Rewind, when did they start having orgies and how come I’m not on the mailing list?
So Cor, are you printing up business cards with your pager number and hours of operation or just going with the halter top tonight?
Nah, I gotta digest and all.
Buffy lying? Buffy going to frat parties? That’s not askew, that’s cockeyed!
Oh.
I’m going to the party.
I want to keep an eye on Buffy, those frat guys creep me.
If it’s on early.
Stewart L. Huntington, Junior. The third. My people have been Delta since… a time that was in the past. Hunting – Hunsinger.
Godzilla is attacking downtown Tokyo! Argh! Argh!
So have either of you seen a pair of girls Here? One is about so high –
Okay, big fun… who’s next?
A friend of mine was here –
One day I will have money and power. And on that day… …they’ll still have more.
What are you doing here?
No. I think Buffy’s still inside somewhere with Cordelia. That’s her car.
I found it in their trash. I saw them through the windows, wearing robes, going down to the basement. I was going to use it to sneak in.
Okay, that is the guy you want to party with.
Got locked out dumping the trash. Let me in, I don’t want to miss the “you know what…”
That’s for the wig, and that’s for the bra…
… that’s for the make-up and that’s for the last sixteen and a half years!
Says here they’ll all get consecutive life sentences: investigators found bones of the missing girls in a huge cavern beneath the D.Z house… and other bones dating back fifty years…
“A surprising number of corporations whose Chairmen and Founders are former Delta Zetas are suffering falling profits, I.R.S raids and suicides in the board room…“ (to Buffy and Willow) Starve a snake, lose a fortune. Boy, the rich really are different.
Angel, Angel, Angel. Does every conversation always have to come around to that freak?
Xander …

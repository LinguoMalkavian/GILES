Actually, it kind of turns me on.
So, this "chair" woman? We are talking Ms. Calendar, right?
Simple deduction: Ms. Calendar is reasonably dollsome, especially for someone in your age bracket; she already knows you're a school librarian, so you don't have to worry about how to break that embarrassing news to her...
Now, is it time for us to talk about the facts of life?
'Cause that whole stork thing is a smokescreen...
Angel.
So why does someone rob graves?
Drawing a blank.
There there.
That Fondren might actually beat Sunnydale in the cross-town body count competition this year?
So, okay, we got us a body snatcher. What does that mean?
So we dig up some graves tonight?
Yeah, why bother him?
So, we're all set, then. Say nine-ish, B.Y.O. shovel.
All right. But if you do run into the army of zombies, could you page us before they eat your flesh?
I know, but did you see her face?
You know, this might go faster if you fems picked up a shovel, too.
Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping to find a fortune in gold dubloons.
You're closer.
So, both coffins empty, that makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.
Angel.
That's gotta be a first.
Karma!
Everybody wave bye-bye.
How about that? I always pegged him as a "one woman" vampire.
Your friend, Chris Epps' locker.
He's into corpses, all right, but we still don't know why.
Any sign of our suspects?
You mean, when there's so many pre-made ones just lying around? The things we do for love...
Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: People don't fall in love with what's right in front of them. People want the dream. What they can't have. The more unattainable, the more attractive.
And speaking of love...
Do I deconstruct your segues? Yeesh.
Hello... I want to get ahead!
For the love of God, somebody scratch my nose!
That's not a coincidence.
Uh, poor girls, technically.
Heads must be no good. Hrnmmm, they seemed attractive enough to me... obviously I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.
They're kinda picky for guys who had three heads to begin with.
Come again?
Yeah, nothing but a lot of computer equipment and a pornography collection so prodigious it even scared me.
Buffy!
Well, I guess that makes it official. Everyone's paired off. Vampires can get dates. Hell, even the school librarian is seeing more action than me. (shakes his head) You ever feel like the world is a giant game of musical chairs, and the music has stopped and you're the only one who doesn't have a chair?
Do you mind? We're talking here.
Oh, yeah. So, why do you think that is?
Actually, it kind of turns me on.

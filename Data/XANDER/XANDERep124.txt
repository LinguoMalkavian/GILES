I forgot high school's unwritten rules of hallway etiquette. Of course, no one ever explained them to me, they'd just stuff me in a locker 'til I drew my own conclusions.
Appreciated...
But if you're looking for a tutor? (raising his hand) Years in the field. Just saying.
At a spanking new Hellmouth High. Please. Outside of drugs, violence, unwanted pregnancy and the unleashed hordes of Armageddon that come pouring out the school's foundation every now and then ... what kind of "trouble" could these kids have?
You're sounding a little less than Gung-ho about the job, there, Buff.
Guy gives you a job... not exactly a thrilling tale of horror.
Maybe. Doesn't make it bad. Those kids got damn lucky, having a Slayer and a friend on campus there for 'em. Hope they appreciate it. I know I did.
Yes and no. With a heavy emphasis on the yes, but at least I was dating then.
The leaving her at the altar thing?
Sure it is. She bounced back to being a Vengeance Demon and I bounced back to being a dateless nerd.
I've seen her at The Bronze a couple times... guess there's a lot of scorned women there making Vengeance wishes on their exes.
Uh ... Hello.
I don't.
And we're gonna do something about this. It's your lucky night. Considering, you know, your dog just got all ate up and stuff. Can I freshen up that tea for ya?
It's sounding monster-ific, all right.
Good thinking. Except ... This is the gang
About as assembled as the Avengers can be these days.
Ex.
Always is.
If you're uncomfortable, we could make you leave.
I'm thinking here - in the company of good friends and pointy weapons.
Damn it, Buffy
Whatever you want.
Shut up, Spike.
And tell them what?
Understood.
Who - Buffy? Oh, she's not ... I mean, she's a girl, and a friend, but she's not my ...
O-kay ...
Right, "Sunnydale: come for the food, stay for the dismemberment."
Just to check in.
Even better. I'm very listed.
Uh, Nancy ...?
Two attacks in one night - I'm thinking it's more than just coincidence.
Right. Who's Ronnie?
Uh-huh. And, just curious here, was this Ronnie guy a "borrow money" kind of trouble, or more of a "raising demon" trouble kind of guy?
Yes.
"Wish?"
Nancy - I'm sorry - can we go back a second? When you wished, was that like wishing on a star, or did you actually wish to a friend that something bad would happen?
This the one you talked to?
Yeah, did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm monster?
Anya has a way of making things happen.
Wait. That gets your sad noise? People's lives are in danger and you give it up for the shih-tzu?
Anya? She's ... Anya. My ex.
Well you can unembellished now.
Buffy ...
Nancy.
Anya, we ...
I'm trying to save your life.
Think about the career choice you're making here, Anya. You're getting people killed.
Well it's gonna be. Forget right and wrong - what you're doing is demonic.
And Buffy's the Slayer. You're a Demon. You kill people - how long you think it's gonna be before she has to do her job?
Not if you stop now.
Reverse the spell.
You can do it.
Nice friends you got.
You saying this is my fault?
And sooner or later, Anya, that excuse just stops working.
Buffy.
She's not calling me.
Where are you going?
You reversed the spell. Took some guts. And I know this is bad - but it could be worse.

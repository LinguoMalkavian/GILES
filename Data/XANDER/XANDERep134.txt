I'm just saying, if you're going to go roughhousing all about, maybe there's a more appropriate place to do it than here, inside, like maybe outside. In another state. RONA We have to practice our hand-to-hand, it's what we do, maybe that thing should have been fastened a little better to the wall anyway, but no, that doesn't matter, just blame us --
Wait, the seers couldn't find her name? Or, like, her address or anything?
No problemo.
Oh good god, what is that smell?
Uh-huh.
Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.
Don't worry Will. It's really no big.
Dawn!
Wow, she's... You're a Potential. You could be the next Slayer.
This is huge. We have to think about this.
We can't She didn't take the cell with her.
You're important now.
Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flash cards. Big ones.
Say Skywalker and I smack you.
She left her phone.
Nice work with the getting swallowed analogy.
I'll pay you to talk about Star Wars again.
Right. All we know is that everything just changed.
I'm not talking about that! I mean, what do you think Buffy's gonna do with this information? Jump up and down and teach Dawn the secret handshake? She knows what this means!
Right! You think Buffy wants that for Dawn?!
Anya.
Gone. We gotta find her. Before the Bringers do.
Ah, I was just thinking about the girls. That's a harsh gig, being a Potential. Just picked out of a crowd, danger and destiny plus if you act now, death.
Well, they're special. No doubt. And the amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know. Not even Buffy.
How much harder it is for the rest of us.
Seven years, Dawn. Working with the Slayer, watching my friends become more and more powerful... a witch, a demon, hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit but come the full moon he had wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful, all of them. And I'm the guy fixing the windows.
I saw what you did last night.
Thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale, 2003. And the minute you found out you weren't, you handed the crown over to Amanda without a moment's pause. You gave her your power.
They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie. To be the one who isn't chosen; to live so near the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes, 'cause nobody's watching me. I saw you last night, I see you working here today... You're not special. You're extraordinary.
What?
Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape.
Yeah.

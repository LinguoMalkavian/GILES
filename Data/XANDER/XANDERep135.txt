Giles, you might wanna get out there.
Get Buffy! Get Buffy! Tell her The First is back!
There're probably Bringers coming, we have to --
You're not The First!
Are you sure?

He was attacked. This guy Robson. In England. Giles was there, helping him, and there was a Bringer...
Robson blacked out. Last thing he remembers, Giles' head was about to get real familiar with the Bringer's very sharp axe.
Robson said that by the time he came to, no Giles.

Desert. We're gonna find Giles.
You're not coming.

I know. They're out there alone with him. All of them.
Few hours.
You didn't bring 'em out there to meditate.
He might know we're coming.
Touch him!
Me too.
We had to come make sure you were okay. We were worried.

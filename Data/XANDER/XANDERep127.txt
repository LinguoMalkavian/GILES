Not since that night with the Gnarl demon. And that wasn't exactly the "how have you been?" kind of talking. More the "pierce its eyes with something sharp" kind of talking. I'm thinking I should call her.
Hopes? Oh no no -- there are no hopes. Anya and I are done, I love being single. I'm a strong successful male who's giddy at the thought of all the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future --
I just worry about her, that's all.
She seems so sad.
Oh that -- no. I don't worry about that. She was hurt and she just turned to what she knew when I... you know... but that's not her anymore.
She turned that worm guy back before any real harm was done right? It just takes a little time. Her heart's not in it...
Are you kidding me? We're doing vent work at the site. Anything's better than breathing freon for eight hours. (looking around) She say what this thing is?
Ah yes, there is little that can distract the Willow when she is on the hunt for the mighty Syllabi.
Yuuhhhllll ...
Or a copycat Spider Demon.
Ugghh... it's sticky.
This isn't springy, high-flying fun...
Is that it?
Maybe there's some way we can lure it --
Ughh -- It smells like cabbage.
We could go home, get more swords, perhaps some sort of... Spider Demon protection amulet... then come back and --
When were you planning on telling us this?
Great. Thank you. Willow... This is Anya . How could you let us -- How could you not have told us?
How could you not have told me?
That doesn't mean you have to kill her.
There are other options.
When? Just now? Took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best friends.
We can change what she did. Fix it. (to Willow) These are mystical deaths, right? There has to be something --
Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you want to kill Anya.
Then don't. This isn't new ground for us. When our friends go all crazy and start killing people, we help them.
I'm sorry... But it's true.
Only because you don't care about her the way I do. Only because you don't...
And you're the slayer. I see now how it's all very simple.
No, of course not, you know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all a grey area...
He had no choice!
You don't understand what she's going through.
Of course not. You think we haven't all seen this before? The part where you just cut us all out, just step away from everything human and act like you're the Law. If you felt what --
This is different.
There has to be another way.
Have you forced yourself to look at the bodies yet?
I want to help you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you, everything I put you through.
You don't understand. This isn't an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you.
Did everybody eat their "crazy flakes" today? You guys are friends -- how can you talk like this?
Buffy, get out of here.
No.
...just want... happy... ending...
Wha -- I'm awake... I'm okay...
What? No... It's fine...
Anya...
Stay away from Willow.
Her name is Anya.
Wait --
Okay. Yes. That seems smart. He just said you have to die! Perhaps there's some sort of alternate price. Something that involves grueling, hard labor. At fair market value taking into account your project's special needs.
No --
Anya -- wait.
Whatever's between us, it doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.
Well, speaking as a cling-ee, kinda didn't mind.
Don't be a dope.
Sometimes...

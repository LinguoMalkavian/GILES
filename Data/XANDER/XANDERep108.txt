You are attractive and have many good qualities.
We didn't wreck. We didn't know.
Maybe we were, but I feel weird feeling bad that my friend's not dead. It's too mind-boggling. So I've decided to simplify the whole thing: Me like Buffy. Buffy alive. So, me glad.
We should spend more time with her. Just hang out. Maybe we should do weekly dinners here. Or a book club, short books, videos.
Alright, alright, I'll read a book. It's not that I can't read, it's just my lips get so tired.
I'm just gonna ... answer that phone, you probably don't hear it, high- pitched ring, ears like a dog's...
Not a problem. The cold only makes me stronger and more macho-like.
I'll say.
Now? Not now, not right after... everything.
Uhh!
Who are you freaks?
I don't have a clue.
Yeah, 'cause I thought you were a girl and I'd remember in a second but--
Okay... why was I on the ground? And why are you all staring at me? Is this some kind of psych test? Am I getting paid for this? Is this a bad dream?
Okay... I'm not panicking, I'm not, I'm not. Stop looking at me like I'm panicking.
Look! Me! Alexander Harris. Cute picture. Hey, I exist!
Harris? That's my last name. Hey, maybe I have a brother and you go out with him. ... or, maybe you go out with me.
Either that or I have one pissed off brother out there somewhere.

There's a trapdoor in the basement, seems to lead to the sewer.
Now I'm not sure what I am, so bear with me here, okay? Um, Now I lay me down to sleep... Shema Israel...uh, Ohm, Ohm.
All ears.
Almost there.
Sounds great.
He's coming.
Yaaa!
Wow.
Sorry. Just got back the memory of seeing 'King Ralph'. We should go back.

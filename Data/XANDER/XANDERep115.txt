The seating chart's fine. Let's go back to table arrangements.
Yeah! Wedding, one week. Family, friends and demons flying in and a to-do list that's not getting shorter. Don't take away the chips.
Why not? He's single. Table Five's for singles.
It's our wedding, not his.
Have you met my Aunt Barbara?
Not my job -- I'm photographer, flower and hotel guy. You have caterer, budget and travel arrangements.
NO!
The radio said no traffic.
It only gives him more time at the bar. Trust me -- He'll be happy.
He can't afford a hotel!
I'm not. I hate my uncle. I hate my whole family. That's why I'm marrying you -- to start a new family, have children, make them hate us, then, when they get married -- sleep on their couch. It's the circle of life.
Why did we ever agree to let your friends -- who are demons -- and my family -- who are monsters -- stay at our place?
Without the laughs. We should have eloped.
Hey, there's the man. The life taker and heart breaker. Y'know -- figuratively speaking.
We're here to help. Just like old times, except for you being all big with the married life.
Okay. So track the demon, find the nest, Mr. and Mrs. Finn here make with the killin', everyone goes home happy. But seriously, married man -- if forced to choose between a photographer or place settings ...
A-dur-hey?
I like it.
He's taken. And that's not my point.
No! I mean, granted, it's hard to imagine Nick and Nora Fury hiding out from relatives in their own bathroom.
They have a great marriage. It bummed Buffy out, but I could see it -- and Anya? I have no clue what their wedding was like.
Separate things. One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements.
Which will soon be over.
That lasts forever.
Huh. And, just curious, how much a chopper rental run you these days?

So it's all about, um, pain and loss?
Well, then, that's just fine and I gotta go be somewhere else...
Mmm. Thanks, Carol.
Oh! Karen. How're you? Let's get you breakfast, okay?
Rory? Whatcha doin' there?
Watch out, it's plugged--
You'll be in the pictures, Mom.
Hey, who wants breakfast?
You're in the pictures, Mom!
You met Krelvin already, Dad. Last night.
Cousin Carol, your earrings are my cufflinks.
Excellent. Cufflinks - check. We're rolling. Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.
Is it too small?
It fit when I picked up the tux. How can it not fit now?
Aw man. What if it doesn't? What if I can't wear my cummerbund and the whole world sees the place where my pants meet my shirt? That can't happen Buffy! I must wear das cummerbund!
You did it?
And I've been meaning to cut back on the habit-forming oxygen.
Or maybe, I dunno... maybe I'm just happy.
Happy teary? Not frustrated with bow tie teary?
She said she had something important to do.
How do I look?
You want to get lucky? I've still got what? Fifteen, twenty minutes?
Okay, breach me.
Check. Number two?
Guys, I better go meet and greet.
Mom, I'm sure it was a mistake-
Got loose?
Hey...
Yeah right, well thanks for the advice, Uncle...help me here.
(gentle; apologetic) I'm sorry. I don't-
What do you mean, 'You're me'?
0h, from the future ! For a minute I thought you were a nutball but now that-
Hey, hey. Take it easy. Everything is going to be okay. I swear I told that kid not to serve drinks before the ceremony.
What is it?
(a bellow) Anya!
You're going out again?
I thought you hated those.
What do you want me to do, Anya!? I can't work. My back is shot!
Not the Buffy thing again-
You used to love it. You loved that I was part of the Slayer's team-
Well, maybe if you'd been there for a change, backing me up-
(needs to believe it) Buffy needed me. I had to help.
I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!
What?
Okay. But see, I was thinking we could put away the dohickey and talk. Like an actual family.
At least he has your interests, you mean. Try to get the kid to talk about anything but the Dow-
Maybe you should talk to your mother about that.
Have I? I'm just saying maybe you should talk to your daughter--
Yeah, you should have. Maybe then I could have gotten some touch in the oughts.
Oh ho! Maybe, but you weren't touching me -
Don't bring her into this-
(eyes narrowing with rage) Shut up.
SHUT UP!
What happened? What was that?
Is she okay? Is she okay? What did I do--
But-
Your double X's aren't doing so bad there, either.
All growed up.
Mmm... 'bout half as much as I love you?
Um... can you give me a sec? I want to go over my vows.
Anya!
Are you alright?
Oh, it... it doesn't matter now.
It's dead.
I know.
I... I'm not.
I know it wasn't. But - it could be.
It wasn't you. It wasn't you I was hating- I've had thoughts, fears before this. Maybe we went too fast-
I know, I know- but-
But we can't start over. If this is a mistake. It's forever. And I don't want to hurt you...

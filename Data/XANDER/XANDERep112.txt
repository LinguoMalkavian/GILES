I get Warren being a supervillainy type. But I thought Jonathan completely learned that lesson. And I never even heard of this other guy.
I'm sensing a not so completely.
Ooh. I mean, pff, nerds.
(to Willow) Welcome to today's episode of "Go Money Go." I hear it every day.
We were gonna all yell "good luck on the new job," but we don't have the timing that kind of thing requires.
So, Buff, how's it going?
It's fast food. I have swum in these murky waters, my friend. There is assorted creepiness, there is staring, there is the enthusiastic not-showing-up-at-all I think you're seeing demons where there's just, life.
Yeah, with the wing-tips.
Make me hungry, why don't you? How about one of those delicious Medley meals?
Hey, thanks!
Well, yeah.
Kmmmph?
Ahn? That was Buffy. She's working late, so I might hafta go--
Honey?
You two... you know each other...
Wow. Um... you guys clearly have catching up to do, so I'll... I'll be not in the apartment --
... Go fish.
Anya's entertaining a vengeance demon named Hallie. Say, Buff, did you ever see what Anya looked like as a demon? Because, if it was that, wow.
(mouth full) Whatph?
Okay, first you say it's cat. Then, you come in, hand me a burger, blah blah, five minutes later, oh by the way that's hot delicious human flesh!
That's your problem with this scenario? How to get seconds?!
Yeth. You jutht mithed the Garyburger.
Gah.
Gah.
You think I should sue over the burger? That's interesting.
She's the Slayer. She saves the whole world. That's way bigger.
Okay, but maybe you'll be a lawyer or doctor and you can use your money to support your deadbeat sister!
Good job, Will! Now, these aren't, like, potions, are they?
Did your friend have a good time? And then leave?
Hey, Ahn? The way she looked... with the... face... that wasn't what you... used to look like, was it?
Okay, is there an answer to that that won't make you nuts?
Well, hun, she was a little... there was some veiny-ness...
Huh?
Oh God no! No reaction!
It's not human! It's not human?
Again I say, huh?

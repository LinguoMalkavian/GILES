She's in the back, This way-
It's in the chest, I think she may-
No. No - it was... He was trying to kill her-
What does that mean? Is she going to-
Come on, Buff. Hang on. We're going to get you to the hospital-
Warren. He had a gun-
It went down too fast. I couldn't stop him-
Willow-
Will! What are you doing?! She's going to die-
The magic. It's not right. You said...
Buffy!
Oh my God... Are you okay?
You've got to stop doing this. I mean the dying thing is funny once. Maybe twice-
I'm going as fast as I-
Would you cut that out, Will!? If you wanted to drive...
I think Buffy gets the tie-breaker on this one. She was the one on the ouchy end of that bullet-
You made the decision to stop for a reason. You promised us. And can I just ask - what's with the make-over of the damned? I mean, the hair-
Go - where?
Will-
Fine! Fine! Puppetmaster wants to drive? Go right ahead!
What?
She's dead?
Christ, Will. Why didn't you say anything?
You said it yourself - the magic is too strong, Will. There's no coming back from it.
But-
Maybe she went to the hospital to find you...
Sure.
Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
So. That's it.
Coming back tomorrow with more of their pretty yellow tape...
Yeah. She's seriously off the wagon. Warren's a dead man if she finds him
Out of the mouths of babes.
I'm just saying - he's as bad as any vampire you've sent to dustville-
And we all know how well the rules work.
I just - I've had blood on my hands all day. Blood from people I love.
So where do we go? She could be anywhere.
No. I'll go. It's okay.
What? Not alright. Are you kidding? After what he did to-
You're not really leaving Dawn with Mr. Attempted Rape-
After the other night, I'd say all bets are off on what he's capable of-
Are you feeling any change? Can you talk?
Look, Anya, something terrible happened-
Willow's out for blood, big time. We need to find her before she finds Warren. Can you think of something? A locator spell...
You can...
Is that like, left over, from your vengeance demon days? That you can sense her?
Oh.
When.
Anya was saying she knows where Will is.
Not exactly. Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
So Willow's all wrathy - why don't you go to her? Isn't that your gig?
If you know where she is - you can help us.
What about Warren? Has she-
Oh my God.

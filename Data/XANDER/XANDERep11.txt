Hey! What’s Cordelia up to?
Cordelia, man... she does love titles.
-- right, right, the guy with the antlers on his belt --
And she had the ... with the hat...
Oh Man...
It was, we had this... you had to be there.
Really.
What kind of moron would be May Queen anyway?
You what?
So, the good kind of moron would do that. The non-moron, I mean. I’ll be in a quiet place now.
Well, you don’t need that stuff now. You’ve got us.
Well, his dad is the most powerful lawyer in Sunnydale.
Mitch’s dad. The lawyer. You’ve never heard of him?
Look at what? Look at Mitch?
And?
Maybe it’s a vampire bat. I’m alone on that one.
We’re on a Hellmouth. It’s gonna be a long list.
What, there’s homework now? How does that happen?
Well, what are you going to be doing?
Well, I think I should do that part.
Talk to Cordelia? So, research, huh?
What’s the word on Harmony?
This is a fairly testy ghost we’ve got.
You think “Testy” is too strong a word? ‘Cause I felt I was understating --
So that means, what -- that we’re talking about an invisible person?
Man, that is so cool.
I’d give anything to be able to turn invisible. (off their looks) Well I wouldn’t be beating people up. I’d use my power to protect the girl’s locker room.
Greek myths talk about cloaks of invisibility, but they’re usually just for the gods. Research boy comes through with the knowledge.
Harmony and Mitch. And the common denominator there --
See ya.
Why don’t you have dinner at our place? Mom’s making her famous phone call to the Chinese place. WILLOW Again? Xander, do you guys have a stove?
Just the hiss of hot air.
Giles said you’d be here. Why are you being here?
I don’t know her.
What did it sound like?
OK, we’ll see you after geometry.
It’s the kiss of death.
Never met her, why?
“Have a nice --” yeeesh.
Well, we probably didn’t see her except to sign the book, this is a big school --
What, she turned invisible because no one noticed her?
But people perceived the whole Marcie package as invisible, clothes and all, not just, you know... (what’s bothering him) So you’re saying she’s not naked.
A-and you would be wanting what?
Wow. For once she’s right.
Who is really, really angry at you. I can’t imagine that, personally, but it takes all kinds, you know?
He can’t be both? ‘Cause some of the stuff he does is heroic.
Can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?
He can just say that and then we have to.
So what’s the answer, Mr. Wizard? Potion, ritual, really silly spell requiring you to shout things?
Let’s go!
Over here!
Can you say “gulp?”
Is this it?
Ya think ?
I’m thinking we ram the door and take our chances.
You’re blacking out on me, guys...
What happened?
Hi. What do you want?
It’s funny ‘cause you look like Cordelia.
Boy. Where’s an invisible girl when you really need one?
Hey! What’s Cordelia up to?

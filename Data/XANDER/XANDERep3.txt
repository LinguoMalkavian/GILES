People scoff at things like school spirit -- but when you see these young women giving their all like this...
...Oooh, stretchy. Where was I?
What do you mean, pretending?
Oh, hey. Here's a little good luck thing for the tryouts...
That was on there when I got it. Really. They all said that.
So we have no idea what caused this? That's a comfort.
So maybe Amber's got this power. To make herself be on fire. Like the Human Torch, only it hurts.
I'll ask around about her.
What do you mean? We're a team! Aren't we a team?
I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide till it goes away.
Hey, we've fought vampires! Anything else'll be a walk in the park.
Cool. Was she wearing it? The bracelet. She was wearing it, right? That's pretty much like we're going out.
So now I'm a figure of fun. I should just ask, right?
See, this is why you're cool. You're like a guy. You're my guy friend that knows about girl stuff.
Hey, they're posting the list!
Spot me, I'm goin' in.
Women and children first.
One of those girls hit me really hard -- we have to start testing for steroids -- -- okay, not only did you make it, but you, Miss Summers, are the number one alternate and Amy's the number three!
Any what better way to celebrate than with a romantic drive-through for two at --
For I am Xander, King of the Cretins, and all lesser cretins must bow before me.
Morning your Highness, beheadings at noon as usual? (to Willow, re: Cordelia's departing back). Okay, see how she has now clue I'm even a mammal, much less a human being?
This invisible man syndrome, a blessing in Cordelia's case, a curse in Buffy's.
Worse, I'm just part of the scenery, like an old shoe, or a rug you walk on every day but you never really see --
Will. That is the point and let's not drive it through my head like a railroad spike. What I have do -- what I'm going to do -- is just what you said --
What I have to do -- what I'm going to do -- is be a man and ask her out. No more i.d. bracelets, subtle innuendo, or Polaroids outside her bedroom window late at night -- that last is a joke to relieve the tension because here she comes .
Alright. Into battle I go. would you ask her out for me? No. Man. Me. Battle.
Buffy, how would you like to...
Huh? I don't know, what I'm saying here is, accompany me Friday night...
Pplllewww!
First vampires, now witches... no wonder you can still afford a house in Sunnydale.
Yeah, those guys don't hang.
So you guys are leaning towards Amy.
We still gotta stop Amy. We should grab her before --
That's the last thing you do! You don't leave a paper trail. Forget that --
We don't have a minute. Cheerleaders' lives are in danger -- Buffy's in danger. (grabs Buffy, tries to hustle her out) You were the first alternate. You're on the team now that Cordelia's out -- you could be next, we have to get you to a safe house.
Yes?
All right, all right. It's not what you think.
Oh. Well, then it is what you think.
I can't.
Wow, you've got a killer streak I've never seen before. Hope I never cross you.
Ha ha. How's Buffy coming with the hair?
Smile and wave to the nice witch.
We'll be right behind you. Only farther away.
Did you see? Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.
Is it me, or is Buffy somewhat looped?
Yeah, before she...
....hurts somebody.
She's on medication --
A wise choice indeed.
I don't think it's your fault.
Let her speak!
Well...
That's great.
Vengeance spell. Like she's getting even with Buffy?
So how do we reverse Buffy's spell?
Show of hands...
I don't care why, I care that you go on breathing.
Come on.
I got her! I got her! Cut her head off!
Saving you.
But she's evil!
Oh.
Willow! It's cool.
Oh yeah. I took care of it.

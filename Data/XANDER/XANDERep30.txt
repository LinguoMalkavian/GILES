DYEAAH!
Man, Buffy. My whole life just flashed before my eyes. I've got to get me a life.
You mean Angel might.
Buffy, this isn't the time to challenge Angel for the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He's at full strength, and you're only half a slayer.
Buffy, are you all right?
We need help!
She fell. WILLOW The flu. CORDELIA She fainted.
Someone should be with her.
She's going to be okay.
Good. Good. That's good.
Hey, Buffy. We're all here.
Probably the fever?
That was a new experience. I'm not used to seeing Buffy scared like that.
Can't say as I blame.
You think she'll be okay in here?
Cordy.
He can come in. It's a public building.
Visiting hours are over.
Why don't you come back during the day... Or, gee, no. I guess you can't.
Maybe not. Maybe that security guard couldn't either -- or those cops. Or all the orderlies... I'm kind of curious to find out. You game?
You're gonna die. I'm gonna be there.
Flowers for m'lady?
Stick 'em in water, maybe they'll grow.
Flu? Doesn't exactly sound monsterrific.
If he asks you to play chess, don't even do it. Guy's like a whiz .
Is this the place where we say, 'What can we do to help?'
It'll be cake. We find out exactly how this little girl Tina died, we get out. Five minutes, tops.
Mm-hmm. Buffy almost died just so she could put you out.
Me here, you there.
Could you make just a little more with the touchy-gropey?
Of Rogain boy? I don't think so. (hands her the file) Take this to Giles, okay?
I'm staying here.
Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her back.
What's that supposed to mean? COR
Oh. Right. Hey !
Jealous?
What do you mean, was ?
Increased oogy-ness... That's a danger signal.
What's the drill?
Sounds like a plan.
No, she's being literal. She had all these medical volumes, used to diagnose me with stuff. I didn't have the heart to tell her she was playing it wrong.
I'm on sentry duty. Angel won't show 'til sundown if at all, but maybe I'll get lucky with this death guy.
Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe and smoking jacket, he's dropped.
Finding out who this thing is is the priority. Cordy, you should go with Giles.
Buffy! Are you okay? Did Angel get in?
You don't know how to kill this thing.
Solid call.
Come on!
Are you okay?
Ooh, and another bag of Chee-Zee Chips.
No. I saw another bag hidden behind the raisins.
Your mom's trying to bogart the Chee- Zee Chips. What's that all about?

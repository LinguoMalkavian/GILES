I have a house to put back together.
Oh, this can't be good.
What are you doing back in town?
We'll see about that.
Now we can do this the hard way if you want --
But believe me when I tell you this'll be much easier on all of us if you just tell us what you know.
Here's the thing -- I don't believe you.
Then you won't mind if we ask you a few questions.
What were you doing buying blood at the butcher's shop?
Hey --
Hey! Anya .
You were perfect. I was worried I overdid it with the whole easy way/hard way thing.
He'll be singing in no time.
Now we let him stew in his own juices for a bit, then we give him the hard brace.
He's primed. He'll be ready to pump in no time.
How's your face?
Sorry about that. She shouldn't have hit you.
You don't know the half of it. She's a Vengeance Demon, you know. She's bad news.
She's killed more men than smallpox.
She's killed a lot of men. She tortures them. Anyone who incurs her wrath. One time she... No. Never mind
It's not important.
Well, there was this one guy... There was this one guy... he broke her heart... so she paid him back.
Well, then she tore his intestines out and rubbed 'em in his face and took pictures of it.
But she's downstairs now. Don't worry about her.
See, the thing is, we've all been a little on edge lately. Some bad things have been happening, and the girls are all looking for someone to blame.
I know. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I get that. But they don't. They need answers. It does seem suspicious, you know, you buying blood.
Anya, no!
He's got a good chunk taken out of his neck, but he'll be all right. Had to tie him up again, but mostly just to keep him from scratching at his bandages. What the hell happened up there?
Trigger.
No. In his head. It's a trigger.
No, this is left over from every army movie I've ever seen, but it makes sense.
Well, usually the operative completes his task and then either blows his head off or steals a submarine.
She's okay. Is this it? I thought there were more of them --
They were so fast, organized --
We were just in the way.

It's a loop. Like the mummy hand. I'm doomed to replace these windows for all eternity. Maybe we should just board these up until things are less Hell-mouthy.
I wish Sleeping Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.
Wake up, Buff.
There's nothing to see. You were doing a little dream talking, that's all.
You okay? What did you see?
Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of the-
Thanks for clearing that up. 'Cause otherwise we might have thought you were up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend .
No. Nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost-
"Catacombs" Yeah. With the skeleton.
That was cool ANDREW That was cool.
This way. Move it.
How's it going?
Why don't you go get some rest? You've been up for, like, two days. We'll call you if we find anything.
It'll be okay, Buff. We've faced this kind of stuff before.
At least let me come with you.
You said yourself you don't know how to fight The First. Or even where it is.
But no pressure.
I don't "follow" her. She's my best friend.
Hey. Junior Slayers. Don't look so worried. I mean, sure, we may not know where Spike is, or how to fight the First, or if and when this Super- style vampire is gonna attack us all, however... House. Boarded up. All we gotta do now is trap this Ubervamp in the pantry - and it's game over.
Who's joking? That pantry thing could work. You saying M. Night Shamyalan lied to us?
Of course you've got a "bad feeling." Dude. You're tied to a chair.
God almighty.
Which square would that be, exactly?

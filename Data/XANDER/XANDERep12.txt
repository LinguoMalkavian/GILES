You know how I feel about you. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? There's never been anyone else for me but you.
We're already good friends, and I'm ready to take the next step. Would you... date me? Oh, that's good! "Date me". It's terrible. Right?
You know what I should do is I should start with talking about the dance. You know, Buffy, Spring Fling isn't just any dance. It's a time when the students all sort of choose a... a mate, and, and we can observe their mating ritual and tag them before they migrate. Just kill me.
Why is this so hard? I should just go up to her and say "I like you, will you go to the dance with me."
I'm ready! I wanna do it now. I gotta do it now.
I can't wait till tomorrow -- I'll be thinking about it too much. Why didn't Buffy show up tonight? What's she doing?
Under the stairs!
I don't feel that boring covers it.
Willow, don't you have a thing?
She's Willow. So Buffy! I wanted to -- there was a thing I wanted to ask you. To talk to you about.
Why don't we sit down. Over here.
There's nothing to be nervous about, silly. Ha.
Hey. Leave.
You know, Buffy, Spring Fling is a time for students to gather and -- oh, God. Buffy, I want you to go to the dance with me. You and me. On a date.
Well, you're not laughing, so that's a good start. Buffy, I like you. A lot. I mean, we're friends, and we've shared experiences, we've fought blood sucking fiends together, and that's a good time, but... I want more than that. I wanna dance with you.
Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is she's playing it really close to the chest.
I don't want to spoil it either. But that's not the point, is it? You either feel a thing or you don't.
Well, try. I'll wait.
No. Forget it. I'm not him. I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
I'm sorry. I don't handle rejection well. Funny, considering how much practice I've had.
You know what? Let's just not.
Figures.
Hey.
On a scale of one to ten, it sucked.
Well, it could be worse. I could have gangrene on my face.
Apart from "no?" Does it really matter? She's still jonesing over Angel and she could care less about me. So I made a big fool of myself.
You're right. The deal is done. No more waiting, worrying -- the polls are in and it's time for my concession speech.
You know what we'll do? We'll go. You and me. Be my date. We'll have a great time. We'll dance, we'll get wild. What do you say?
Good! What?
Willow, come on --
I'm, uh... I didn't think...
That's okay. I don't want to go to the dance. I'll just go home, lie down, and listen to country music, the music of pain.
She WHAT?
And she knew about this prophecy of yours? Oh, MAN! What do we do?
Calm!?
I'm sorry -- Staying calm may work fine for Locutus of the Borg here but I'm freaked out and I plan to stay that way.
How could you let her go?
Do you mind?
I don't care. I'm sorry, I don't. I gotta help Buffy.
No. But I can find out.
Mind if I come in?
She's gone.
Buffy. She's going right now to fight the Master.
Rumour has it. Only we're not gonna let that happen.
I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground, right? Some old church? Take me to him.
How can I say this clearly?
I don't like you. At the end of the day I pretty much think you're a vampire. But Buffy, man, she's got a big ol' yen for you. I don't get it. She thinks you're a real person. Right now I need you to prove her right.
Aren't you?
You were looking at my neck.
You were checking out my neck! I saw that.
You just keep your distance, pal.
I told you to eat before we left.
What is that?
Come on. Come on!
She's not dead.
If she drowned there's a shot. CPR. You have to do it. I have no breath.
Come on. Come on.
Breathe!
Buffy?
Welcome back.
Easy...
Buffy, you're still weak.
How do you know where the Master's going?
Right.
Sorry.
Yeah, Buffy died and everything.
I hear there's a dance over at the Bronze. Could be fun...
So what's the story with the car?
We're already good friends, and I'm ready to take the next step. Would you... date me? Oh, that's good! "Date me". It's terrible. Right?

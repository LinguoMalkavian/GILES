Uh, actually, your hands won’t be building so much as they’ll be lifting and toting.
It’s just a temp gig, Buf. You know, unless it takes. Since you're not union, I had to call in a few favors to get you on a crew.
Uh-huh. So, Giles have any thoughts about that little fast-forward freak-out you had at school?
Okay, first tip of the day: when I introduce you to Tony, the foreman... You may wanna leave out stuff about blacking out and evil lint.
Tony... This is Buffy. You know, the friend I told you about.
Give her a chance. She's stronger than she looks.
Upstairs. Gotta supervise the sheet rock hangers. Don't sweat it. I'll check in later.
Buffy? What-- What happened? How--?
Here? No. Not here. Not at my job. That’s your job.
Buffy, look at this mess! You have any idea how much it’s gonna cost to repair this? What am I supposed to say to the clients? Should I just show them the demon bodies and say it’s all their fault?
I know. I believe you. In fact, I’m starting to think, between this attack and the. thing at school, that somebody’s messing with you.
Well, something’s going on. Think it’s worth checking into. And I don’t mean later. You need to see Giles and get on this right away. I’d start with IDing those demons...
Big time. The whole melty thing should help narrow it down. Try sketching them, that always helps...

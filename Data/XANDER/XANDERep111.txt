You're still trying to mack on Buffy? Wake up already. Never gonna happen.
Yes, ma'am.
What happened to Buffy? She's gone.
Great. Except we DON'T HATE BUFFY. Put her back at our table.
We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
Buffy?! Where-- where are you?
(yanks his hand) Sorry. Her clothes are... invisible... too.
Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy? This is serious.
Buff, did you see anyone or anything suspicious before you... cleared up?
I'm less with the why, and more with the how. We get the how, then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again. Right?
Buffy, can you focus please?
I could go check out the spot Buffy disappeared. Snoop for clues.
A walk?!
Buffy!
A spell from who? You said it yourself... It makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible.
A magic mistake. Who'd be messing with that kinda pow--
How's it going?
Will, we need to talk.
Something you wanna tell me?
Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is part of recovery. We understand that. We just have to figure away to fix it.
Fix Buffy.
You know what I-- You don't know? Rhymes with "blinvisible?"
Buffy was in town, leaving the haircutting place, when she suddenly--
Yeah. It's adorable. Apparently. I, personally, couldn't tell since she's all... blinvisible.
No. Not- Well, c'mon, Will. Some of your spells have caused weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another. And let's not forget the recent forgetting.
No one's blaming-
Look, if you say you didn't do it--
What is this fascination with walking?
Hey. Will. What are you--?
No jumping. Look! Feet firmly planted.
Me, too, sorry.
Those coulda been made anytime.
What is it?
What fire hyd-- Oww!
Black paint. Buffy's phantom van. We should let her know-whoa--
Trying to save a good parking space?
Oh, fun. What about you?
Really?
Ahn, honey! we're looking for invisibility spells here.
What happened?
Ew.
The cone's losing its substance. Like it's breaking down or something. We have to find Buffy. She's gotta know.
Anya. What's happening to the pylon, will probably happen to her. If we don't find Buffy... I mean, if we don't figure out how this was done...
Spike?
Spike?
Exercising. Naked. In Bed.
Yuh-huh. Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs. Mini-disaster area.
No. I'm... I'm looking for Buffy.
Well, you wouldn't. Fact is, she's come down with a slight case of invisibility.
We don't know yet.
(squinting at him) After your... exercises.
Y'know... kidding aside, Spike... You really should get a girlfriend.

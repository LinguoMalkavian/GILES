Coming through… Coming through… Not certain how to stop…
Willow! You’re so much the person I wanted to see.
Yeah. You know, I kind of had a problem with the math.
The math. Can you help me tonight? Please? Be my study buddy?
A shiny nickel…
Check it out?
Right. I’m there. See, I want to change.
Jesse! What’s what.
That’s right, I saw her. She’s pretty much a hotty.
So. Tell.
What’s the sitch? What do you know about her?
Well, you’re certainly a font of nothing.
Can I have you? Dyeh – can I help you?
I don’t know you, do I?
Xander. Is me. Hi.
Maybe I’ll see you around. Maybe at school, since we both… go there…
“We both go to school…” Very suave. Very not pathetic.
Oh, hey, you forgot your… …stake…
Hey. Are you guys busy? Can we interrupt? We’re interrupting.
Oh, me and Buffy go way back. Old friends, very close. Then there was that period of estrangement, I think we were both changing as people, but here we are and it’s like old times, I’m quite moved.
It’s not you.
And to return this.
The only thing I can figure is that you’re building a really little fence.
So. What do you like, what do you do for fun, what do you look for in a man… Let’s hear it.
Well, not a lot happens in a one-Starbucks town like Sunnydale. You’re big news.
So not just a little dead then.
WHAT? CUT TO:
You’re leaving already?
Not tonight.
We are talking about Willow, right? Scoring at the Bronze. Work it, girlfriend.
Why, you know something about Mr. Goodbar that she doesn’t? Oh! Hey. I hope he’s not a vampire . ‘Cause then you’d have to slay him.
I only know that you think you’re a slayer, and I only know that ‘cause I was in the library today.
You’re serious.
Come on.
Buffy, we bail now, right?
Yeah. You know, I kind of had a problem with the math.

Man... something hit me...
That girl grabbed him. Took off.
I don't know.
Okay, this is where I have a problem, see, because we're now talking about vampires. We're having a talk with vampires in it.
So vampires are demons?
And that would be a what?
Except for one thing. How do you kill them?
Well, Jesse --
That's not true.
They can fly ?
Oh.
Well, there's electrical tunnels. They run under the whole town.
I don't see any access.
Someone's been naughty...
What?
So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face.
I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.
Did you see anything?
Something stupid. I followed you. I couldn't just sit around not doing anything.
Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him, then that's what I gotta do.
Besides, it's this or Chem class.
Okay, so: crosses, garlic, stake through the heart.
Cool. Of course, I don't actually have any of those things.
Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to come down here. I brought this, though.
Okay, okay. So, what else?
For Vampire Slayage.
So you've done some beheading in your time.
Actually, I find it oddly comforting.
How can you tell?
Over there. What's that?
Jesse!
Jesse!
Jesse, man, are you okay?
It's cool! Buffy's a superhero!
You think anybody heard that?
Oh, now you tell us.
Come on.
We can't fight our way back through those things... what do we do?
Jesse... Man, I'm sorry...
Well, that's a plus.
Jesse. Man, we're buds. Can't you remember?
Then get out of my face.
I can't believe it... we were too late.
There is no out of here!
What's that?
Up?
Yeah.
I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.
End of the world.
And this Harvest thing is to get him out?
They're going to the Bronze.
Come on, tasty young morsels all over the place. Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be. Trust me.
Can you break it down?
Come on! CUT TO:
Heads up...
Jesse, man... don't make me do it.
Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in there.
One thing's for sure. Nothing is ever gonna be the same. CUT TO:
I don't know! Something. The dead rose! We should've at least had an assembly.
Next time?
Buffy, this isn't good.
Hey, that's a plan. 'Cause a lot of schools aren't on Hellmouths.
